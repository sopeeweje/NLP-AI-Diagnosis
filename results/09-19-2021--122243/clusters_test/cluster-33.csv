"Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest Project Summary In situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest, it is critical to quickly detect the performance of adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) through clinically acceptable pulse rate and blood pressure (BP). However, the detection of adequate CPR can be difficult for someone not trained in first aid. Currently the standard for measuring BP noninvasively is using cuff-based oscillometeric approaches. Attempts at developing these into wearable devices for automated and continuous measurements have proven difficult and so researchers have looked at other methods. However, these methods have not met the criteria for flexibility, accuracy, and low power consumption. This project aims to develop a flexible patch for accurate detection of pulse rate and blood pressure superficially through the radial, brachial, carotid, and/or femoral arteries. Piezoelectric polymers, are inherently flexible and have been used in many applications for pressure sensing, offering great potential for use as a patch-like sensor for monitoring of cardiovascular function. However, in the standard form, the material is not sensitive enough to accurately detect blood pressure. In our lab we have developed a core-shell nanofiber structure of conductive and piezoelectric nanofibers, respectively. The core-shell nanostructure shows a 4.5 times improvement in pressure sensitivity when compared to standard piezoelectric nanofibers and a nearly 40 times improvement when compared to piezoelectric polymer thin films. This improvement in pressure sensitivity should allow for a wearable device composed of these materials to exceed the necessary 35 dB signal to noise ratio required for the accurate detection of pulse wave velocity, a cardiovascular parameter used to determine blood pressure. Coupled with inkjet printing patterning techniques of conductive polymers developed in our lab, we propose to fabricate a novel core-shell nanofiber piezoelectric array in a wearable patch form for cardiovascular monitoring. In order to test this piezoelectric array and develop data-driven algorithms for the detection of blood pressure, testing will occur on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system capable of replicating a human’s diastolic and systolic blood pressures, pulse rates, and arterial mechanical properties. The blood pressure attainable by the simulated system falls within the AAMI standard benchmark for accuracy and precision for noninvasive blood pressure monitoring of 5 ± 8 mmHg. We will train various regression models using the data generated from this system to relate the detected pulse wave velocities to blood pressure and we will compare the outcomes to commonly used correlation equations. We propose that the fabrication methods we will develop, when coupled together with data-driven algorithms, will allow for the development of a low- power, flexible patch, capable of detecting pulse rate and blood pressure, giving feedback on the adequacy of CPR. Project Narrative This project plans to develop a patch-like sensor for detecting cardiovascular signals including pulse rate and blood pressure for situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest. The proposed research couples a novel core-shell piezoelectric nanostructure with an inkjet printing method for fabricating flexible arrays, to create a new class of wearable patch-like sensors for cardiovascular monitoring. Testing these sensors on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system, will allow for the development of data-driven algorithms to improve the accuracy of these devices, leading to highly accurate, patch-like cardiovascular sensing.",Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest,10288237,R21EB032056,"['Algorithms', 'Arteries', 'Benchmarking', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'First Aid', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Heart Arrest', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ink', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Polymers', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Pulse Rates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structure', 'Sulfur', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'detection method', 'falls', 'femoral artery', 'first responder', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mechanical properties', 'nanofiber', 'novel', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'polyvinylidene fluoride', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'pulse pressure wave', 'radial artery', 'random forest', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,232061
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device,10266206,U18TR003812,"['Acute', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 monitoring', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Process', 'Production', 'RADx Radical', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'fight against', 'fighting', 'global health', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nasopharyngeal swab', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'point of care', 'portability', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'respiratory hypoxia', 'screening', 'severe COVID-19', 'two-dimensional']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U18,2021,999775
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,10166912,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2021,678001
"Augmented Reality Platform for Telehealth Rehabilitiation Efforts to keep the most vulnerable individuals with chronic medical conditions from being exposed to COVID- 19 have triggered an unprecedented decline in the number of visits to ambulatory practices. The repercussions have impacted not only those with the disease, but the many millions of older persons in need of healthcare who forego in-person visits in fear of infection or for socioeconomic reasons. While the precipitating need for alternative healthcare delivery methods has hastened the adoption of software solutions, such as Zoom, traditional videoconferencing services fail to compensate for the lack of direct physical evaluations with a patient that is needed for evaluating musculoskeletal (MSK) deficits, planning therapeutic interventions, and guiding exercise compliance—essential components of evidence-based practice among rehabilitation practitioners. To overcome these shortcomings, our team of computer vision and human movement engineers is partnering with orthopedic rehabilitation specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to develop a telehealth platform that fuses high resolution RGB and Depth (RGD-D) video data readily obtainable from a modern smartphone to facilitate quantitative, MSK assessment. The innovation builds upon our work in computing movement outcome measures from vision-based body tracking algorithms, and our skills in augmented reality (AR) software development to enhance a clinician’s assessment and exercise instruction capabilities. Our pilot data demonstrate that accurate quantitative rehabilitation outcomes are obtainable using RGB-D body tracking algorithms during a sub-set of knee activities. Phase I will advance these capabilities by deriving and validating the accuracy of 3D body tracking and rehabilitation outcome measures during a wider set of activities used clinically for assessing knee mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength, and function from depth enabled smartphone video recordings in control subjects (Aim 1). Aim 2 will develop a proof-of-concept AR telehealth platform with the help of the MGH team that delivers an enhanced telehealth experience through real-time synchronized audio-visual processing, real-time display of quantitative rehabilitation outcomes for the therapist to assess deficits or guide exercise compliance, and instructional animations for the patient to safely carry out the rehabilitation activities. The proof-of-concept prototype will undergo feasibility testing in Aim 3 among n=5 physical therapists and n=10 patients with knee OA during a simulated telehealth session to achieve high ratings for usability, accessibility, and effectiveness. The results will inform the user-requirements of a more complete Phase II telehealth platform designed in close collaboration with industry partners to provide secure cloud based communication for seamless interoperability between devices; additional examination tools (e.g. gait analysis); a broader range of baseline assessment and therapeutic exercise protocols for additional MSK conditions; and HIPAA-compliant deployment and electronic documentation management. The final prototype system will be evaluated during actual telehealth visits at multiple clinical sites to promote safe and effective clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical care has by necessity shifted towards telehealth delivery for people at risk due to age, who live in underserved communities or avoid in-person visits out of fear of viral transmission. Existing telehealth software platforms are generally supportive of videoconferencing but have yet to provide rehabilitation professionals with quantitative outcomes typically obtained from direct physical evaluations with a patient. To overcome this shortcoming, we are developing an augmented reality platform that fuses RGB and depth imaging from a patient’s smartphone to deliver quantitative outcomes of knee joint mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength and function during a telehealth visit to support the mandate for more effective remote delivery of evidence-based rehabilitation during the global pandemics and beyond.",Augmented Reality Platform for Telehealth Rehabilitiation,10256844,R43AG072991,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Augmented Reality', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quarantine', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic exercise', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videoconferencing', 'Virtual Tool', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animation', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cloud based', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'gait examination', 'health care delivery', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'joint mobilization', 'new technology', 'outpatient programs', 'pandemic disease', 'partial recovery', 'patient safety', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'remote delivery', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'software development', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'underserved community', 'usability', 'viral transmission', 'visual processing']",NIA,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2021,286972
"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10421230,R43NS119015,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Blinking', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Epilepsy', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Gold', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Shark', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tonic - clonic seizures', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'commercialization', 'detection platform', 'digital health', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'premature', 'prospective', 'software systems', 'statistical and machine learning', 'visual tracking', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2021,138041

"Malarial retinopathy screening system for improved diagnosis of cerebral malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. In 2018, malaria affected more than 213 million people in Africa alone and claimed 381,000 lives, more than 65% of whom were African children less than 5 years old. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM, incorrect treatment, and resulting mortality or neurological disability. The specificity of the current standard of care for clinical diagnosis of CM (physical symptoms, coma, and malaria parasite test such as rapid diagnostic testing) is reported around 61%. Therefore, there is a significant market need for a highly specific, low-cost, and easy-to-use test to improve CM diagnosis and save lives. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 95% specific to the presence of CM, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. Screening for MR in addition to the current standard of care improves the specificity of CM diagnosis from 61% to 100%. VisionQuest Biomedical has developed ASPIRE, the first fully automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera, a system that can be operated by minimally trained personnel such as medical technician or nurse without the need of an ophthalmic specialist. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of regulatory consultants, commercialization experts, business development specialists, and clinicians; to clinically deploy and launch ASPIRE in our target market in Africa. This team will validate and prepare ASPIRE for regulatory clearance as well as finalize the marketing and commercial rollout strategy. In Phase II-B, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical deployed a fully-functional clinical version of ASPIRE and tested it in nine malaria clinics in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In CRP, ASPIRE will be validated for technical and clinical performance and will be brought to commercial readiness with regulatory clearance. We will accomplish this through four specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be validated to bring it under design controls. In the second aim, we will deploy ASPIRE at 25 clinics in Africa to demonstrate safety and efficacy as well as to promote market traction. The third aim will focus on preparing ASPIRE for regulatory submission. In the fourth aim, we will complete African healthcare market research for a startup market of 5 countries (Malawi, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda) and finalize marketing and rollout strategy. Within one year after CRP, our goal will be to deploy ASPIRE in more than 200 malaria clinics across 5 countries in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which claims hundreds of thousands of lives of African children every year. The detection of retinal biomarkers of CM, called malarial retinopathy, can improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM.

"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children.

"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources. We will also conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities, use machine learning for risk predictions, and implement active surveillance for devices and technologies.",Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs).,10209943,U01FD006936,[' '],FDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,U01,2021,50000
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,10088471,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,768996
"BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline ABSTRACT Clinical Need: As the US population ages, managing pathologies that largely affect older adults, including sarcopenia (e.g., loss of muscle mass and strength), represents a significant and growing clinical challenge. In addition to increased rates of sarcopenia with age, it is well-accepted that its incidence and impact increases after acute illness, placing persons at additional risk for functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance-based exercises promote muscle regeneration and strength, and are an advised therapy for such patients. Yet, exercises are normally conducted either under direct clinical oversight, or unsupervised by patients at home, where compliance rates are low. Limitations: Current regimens rely on self-report diaries or verbal reports that may be inaccurate and subject to recall bias. Remote monitoring systems that measure, track, analyze, and provide patient-oriented feedback may overcome these limitations and enhance exercise regimen engagement. An at-home device that monitors and transmits exercise data to the user and clinician represents a potential solution to this clinical challenge. Our Product – BandPass is a remote-sensing, bluetooth-enabled resistance exercise band that will accurately gauge force through a potentiometric sensor rigidly fixed to elastic-tubing purposely designed for resistance training. The device is similar to currently available exercise bands familiar to clinicians and patients, with the significant novel addition of integrated force monitoring and internet-connectivity. A mobile app and cloud-based platform will provide computational resources for data visualization, storage and analysis, which will enable direct patient feedback, clinical monitoring of patient compliance and progress, and serve as a platform for more advanced operations such as automatic exercise-type classification to ease user burden (e.g., minimizing required interactions between the user and mobile device). We hypothesize that BandPass will provide clinically relevant data on compliance and use of exercise training with feedback that will be personalized. Specific Objectives: We specifically propose to design custom electronics and housing for BandPass and to perform in-lab validation studies of device accuracy, precision, and long-term stability. BandPass will be interfaced to a mobile app and cloud-based platform we will implement for data transmission, storage, and analysis. Finally, we will deploy BandPass in a human subjects pilot study to demonstrate usability and system stability in an at-home setting. Future Directions: SynchroHealth is a small company developing an mHealth platform that uses internet-connected devices to help improve quality of life in older adults. This device will complement our existing efforts. By the end of this Phase 1 effort, we will have demonstrated that BandPass is functional in a human population and we will have provided evidence that this approach can be deployed effectively in an at-home setting. This will position us for Phase 2 funding focused on optimizing our device for manufacturing, developing and optimizing a full suite of cloud-based analysis tools and mobile applications, conducting clinical trials aimed at demonstrating efficacy, and preparing to register this as a 510(k)-exempt device for marketing purposes and establishing Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical care for older adults that suffer from sarcopenia (e.g. loss of muscle mass and strength) typically involves the use of physical therapy regimens that rely on patients performing a series of at-home resistance-based exercises in order to retain or build muscle strength and prevent further atrophy. Resistance exercises using elastic bands has been a primary tool for clinicians, however remotely monitoring a patient’s compliance, confirming the quality of exercises performed, and tracking performance has been a significant challenge, with no tools currently available to provide this level of insight. Here, we propose to develop BandPass, an internet-enable resistance exercise band instrumented to automatically sense forces generated during exercise which will enable remote monitoring, compliance checking, and exercise classification and help to overcome the current shortcomings in clinical management of these patients.",BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline,10152884,R41AG071290,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Atrophic', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institutionalization', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Orthopedics', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age-related muscle loss', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'compliance behavior', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data visualization', 'design', 'diaries', 'exercise regimen', 'exercise training', 'functional decline', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'monitoring device', 'muscle form', 'muscle regeneration', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'remote monitoring', 'remote sensing', 'resistance exercise', 'sarcopenia', 'sensor', 'strength training', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NIA,SYNCHROHEALTH LLC,R41,2021,224700
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array",10266403,U18TR003775,"['Address', 'Age', 'Astronomy', 'Benchmarking', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 testing', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Housekeeping', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Lawyers', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Occupations', 'Odors', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Production', 'RADx', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Workplace', 'animal care', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'community setting', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high standard', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanosensors', 'next generation', 'novel virus', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health emergency', 'racial diversity', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sensor', 'sex', 'software development', 'software systems', 'vapor', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U18,2021,999830
"A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals Project Summary/Abstract This Administrative Supplement proposes the participation of a 3-member team from the Center for Progressive Recovery, LLC (CPR) in the Innovation Corps (I-Corps™), an intensive, 8-week program focused on developing a successful commercialization plan and business model for technology-driven start-ups funded by NIH’s SBIR Phase I mechanism. The program would entail training, as well as structure and accountability around conducting 100 interviews with key stakeholders and others whose expertise would inform the company’s plans. The SBIR Phase I award to CPR (the small business concern, SBC) that this application is predicated on addresses the problem that the people at the greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get life-saving medication. Justice- involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to receiving bup for this population are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual motivation. We will disrupt system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot. This will be the only tool needed to receive a referral to a bup provider. We will also address low individual motivation with the chatbot by programming it to deliver the efficacious Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) without the need for a trained human. Our aims are: Aim 1: Design and develop a prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement. Milestones: (a) human-centered design (HCD) interviews with key stakeholders; and (b) creation of a chatbot using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) that is integrated with a mobile application; Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to the BNI Chatbot or Digital Resources (i.e., Digitally-delivered OUD and buprenorphine education and referral resources). The following 3-member team has deep expertise in developing and bringing to market digital health solutions and was formed to pursue the unique benefits of the I-Corps program. All 3 are able to meet the time-intensive requirements of the training program: 1) Michael V. Pantalon, Ph.D., CEO; 2) Marianne S. Pantalon, Ph.D., PI, and 3) Thomas Wheeler, Industry Expert and CTO.

The specific aims of the SBIR Phase I awarded to CPR (the small business concern) that this application is predicated on are: 1) to design and develop a prototype of an AI-powered Brief Negotiation Interview Chatbot to motivate probationers (who have among the highest rates of death by opioid overdose) to engage in buprenorphine, a treatment that reduces overdoses by half, and 2) to conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to the BNI Chatbot or Digital Resources.",A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals,10304214,R43DA051267,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Buprenorphine', 'Businesses', 'Death Rate', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Innovation Corps', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediation', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Overdose', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prisons', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stigmatization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'chatbot', 'commercialization', 'design', 'digital', 'digital health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'member', 'mobile application', 'mortality risk', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'probation', 'probationer', 'programs', 'prototype', 'system-level barriers', 'tool']",NIDA,"CENTER FOR PROGRESSIVE RECOVERY, LLC",R43,2021,55000
"Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors ABSTRACT Aura is a digital health platform that uses Epilog™, a miniature, wireless, wearable EEG sensor worn on the scalp below hairline that can record clinical and subclinical seizures. After an initial diagnosis of epilepsy, an epileptologist will use known information about patients’ seizures to guide the best scalp location to place the Epilog EEG sensor (A). EEG data is continuously transferred (B) to the Aura app on a person’s smartphone (C) using secure BluetoothTM where it communicates over WiFi (D) to the Aura cloud platform (E). Epilog EEG is analyzed for seizures and a daily digital seizure diary is shared with epileptologists (F) and pushed back to the Aura app (G). Epilog is recharged daily, and reusable for a year. Epilog is designed to be discreet, allowing for continuous use in all facets of daily life. Data are a 10 s snippet of the beginning of a focal seizure with motor impairment and intact awareness (ILAE 1A1) recorded from Epitel’s single-channel Epilog sensor placed on the left forehead. The patient was admitted for video-EEG monitoring as standard-of-care. This seizure was verified independently by three epileptologists. In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are having (>50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary. In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of $380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures. These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability. Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy. This grant proposal aims to create a digital health platform that includes a wearable medical device worn on the scalp below the hairline. The system detects and counts seizures, and alerts to seizures in real time. The goal is to empower people with epilepsy to take control of their seizure monitoring and help improve the treatment of epilepsy.",Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors,10200346,U44NS121562,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auras', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Community Hospitals', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focal Seizure', 'Forehead', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Left', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurologic', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Seizures', 'Services', 'Sleep', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'System', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cost', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'digital health', 'effective therapy', 'encryption', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'remote monitoring', 'sensor', 'social', 'standard of care']",NINDS,"EPITEL, INC.",U44,2021,999853
"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10353084,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Equipment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Information Systems', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vendor', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical care', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'design', 'encryption', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'point of care', 'smartphone Application', 'tool']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2021,40963
"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,10266337,U18TR003795,"['2019-nCoV', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 test', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhalation', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Flushing', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heating', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Materials Testing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Spectrometry', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'clinical care', 'detector', 'deviant', 'differential expression', 'disease transmission', 'graphical user interface', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'ion mobility', 'large scale production', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pandemic disease', 'portability', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U18,2021,975463
"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Project Summary/Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project proposes the deployment of an AI-powered image-processing tool, named PostureCheck™, to automatically detect when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-extremity (UE) rehabilitation exercises. The system is based on a standard video camera and the artificial intelligence (AI) software developed under the NIH Phase-I project. PostureCheck™ will be fully integrated with Barrett Technology's existing Burt® UE rehabilitation robot, ensuring that patients are provided appropriate and timely feedback to encourage the correct performance of therapeutic exercises without requiring constant therapist supervision.  Burt® is an FDA-listed UE rehabilitation robot that supports the weight of a patient's arm and hand while the patient moves his/her arm to interact with on-screen games. Burt® offers guided assistance, visual and haptic feedback, and activities and assessments to both help train the patient and measure progress. Clinical studies have shown that Burt® can be used to improve patients' performance in one-on-one sessions with a therapist. However, the system lacks the capability for a single therapist to monitor and work with several patients and Burt® systems at one time.  The proposed SBIR Phase-II activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, the annotated dataset generated in Phase-I will be used to develop three separate AI modules. These modules will be integrated into a framework that allows therapists to monitor the outcome of the modules, and, through feedback, enable the system to auto- adapt to improve performance continuously. In Aim 2, stakeholder feedback will be gathered and integrated to design multiple user interfaces for the PostureCheck™ tool. Specific interfaces will be created for use by therapists during and after RT sessions. PostureCheck™ will be integrated with the Burt® device to empower therapists to provide effective feedback to patients and deter the use of compensatory movements. Finally, in Aim 3, forty-two stroke survivors will be recruited in an interventional study deploying the PostureCheck™ and Burt® systems. Subjects will undergo eighteen RT sessions in either an individual or group therapy format. Motor performance between groups will be compared to gather information about the suitability of the combined systems for multi-patient RT therapy in future rehabilitation centers.  The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a practical Burt®-plus-PostureCheck™ system to empower therapists to supervise multiple patients simultaneously through a gamut of useful functionalities. The system will be suitable for deployment in clinics as well as rehabilitation centers such as wellness gyms. Project Narrative  Each year, more than 650,000 Americans survive a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body in most cases. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and ultimately improved function. This proposal aims to expand PostureCheck™, to provide timely and targeted feedback and enable therapists to perform robot-assisted and multi-patient therapy in a minimally supervised session.",PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device,10156853,R44EB027525,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Therapy', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation device', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'chronic stroke', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'haptic feedback', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'interest', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'robot assistance', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'software development', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIBIB,"BARRETT TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R44,2021,813419
"Quantitative histopathology for cancer prognosis using quantitative phase imaging on stained tissues Summary Fast, accurate, and scalable testing has been recognized unanimously as crucial for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and future pandemics. We propose a technology that allows rapid (~2 minutes) testing for SARS CoV-2. Our technology combines novel label-free imaging and dedicated deep-learning algorithms to detect and classify viral populations in exhaled air. If successful, this project will result in a device based on quantitative phase imaging and integrated AI tools, which will detect the unlabeled virus acquired by the patient’s breath condensed on a microscope slide. Toward this goal, we will advance Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM), an ultrasensitive label-free imaging technique, proven to measure structures down to the sub-nanometer scale. SLIM was developed in the PI’s Lab at UIUC, its original publication received 490 citations to date, and has been commercialized by Phi Optics (Research Park, UIUC), with sales across the world in both academia and industry. Applying the computed fluorescence maps back to the QPI data, we propose to measure nanoscale features of viral particles, with high specificity, minimal preparation time, and independent of clinical infrastructure. As a result, the new technology will eventually be ideal for point-of-care settings, surveillance screening and as a home monitoring device. We anticipate that our approach will be scalable to other viruses, with new imaging and training data. Narrative We propose a breath test using label-free imaging and AI: an individual exhales on a microscope slide, which is fed into a SLIM microscope equipped with a computer that runs deep-learning pre-trained algorithms for SARS CoV-2 identification.

"Portable Hearing Laboratory  - CRP In the parent Phase II project (R44DC016247; PI: C. Pavlovic) we successfully developed a portable platform for developing and testing new hearing aid technology. This Portable Hearing Laboratory, or PHL, has now been acquired and is being used by a number of leading university laboratories and other research centers and their feedback has been extremely positive. The device features a central unit (BatAndCat Box) which provides an appropriate and complete hearing aid ambient for developing new algorithms. A number of realistic interfaces has also been provided. This includes an extremely high quality BTE system we designed; an ITE system adapted by us, as well as an appropriate interface circuitry for typical wearables (e.g; headsets via the line input). Finally, a smart phone app features interfaces both for the researcher and the subject. The system runs the Master Hearing aid sweet developed concurrently in R01DC015429 (PIs Hohmann and Pavlovic). In this CRP renewal we will achieve the following goals: 1. Implement various Design for Excellence Measures (DFX) and super modern manufacturing  technology to obtain the highest product quality at the lowest product cost. This would make  the product affordable for large clinical studies and, potentially, for some consumer sales. 2. In response to the recent availability of, and the recent research demand for, a far greater  processing power to enable the development of algorithms which rely on machine learning,  we plan to increase the processing power of the device by at least 10 times, and likely 20  times, by changing the processor core to a multicore system. 3. Introduce modern low-latency BLE technology to enable efﬁcient noise reduction by utilizing  remote microphones and machine learning. 4. The other complementary requirement to extract speech from noise is being able to inform  the system whom the listener is actually listening to. This will be achieved by providing on  the PHL the interface means for external multi-sensor arrays such as EEG, OEG, etc. 5. Execute electrical and mechanical design changes dramatically reducing the size and  weight of the device. This would not only be a much more acceptable device for long clinical  trials, but would also open up a direct-to-consumer, secondary market for the device. 6. It is our strong determination to provide continuous support to the Beta sites for extensive  further testing of the device in a variety of settings. We consider this the best means to  reach the perfection. Portable Hearing Laboratory (PHL), developed in R44DC016247 has been deployed successfully at various research centers and it features a central unit connected to a number of realistic interfaces such as BTEs, ITEs, or typical wearables. In this CRP renewal we upgrade the technology to support demanding machine learning algorithms interfaced almost inconspicuously to a number of EEG and EOG electrodes to extract perfectly speech from noise.
