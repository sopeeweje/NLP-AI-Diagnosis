"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,10118191,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2021,177444
"Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis Project Summary After nearly five decades of human voice research, much remains unknown regarding muscle control mechanism of voice production. Studies confirmed that vocal fold pre-phonatory posture (geometry, position, tension and stiffness) is among the primary factors controlling vocal fold vibratory dynamics and voice type. However, very limited data is available on muscle control of these properties, primarily due to experimental difficulties. Muscle control of glottic geometry and dynamics has been studied in in vivo human and animal models, but these studies were limited to an endoscopic superior view, thus cannot to provide 3D deformation/movement of the vocal folds. Moreover, tension and stiffness of the vocal fold tissues are very difficult to obtain in vivo due to a lack of reliable techniques. A significant knowledge gap remains regarding how intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILMs) control voice production through vocal fold posturing as well as how ILM dysfunctions, such as vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP), affect voice production by altering vocal fold posturing. In this project, we propose to use an innovative approach that integrates experimental data and state-of-the-art computer modeling techniques to produce a complete dataset of 3D vocal fold postures (geometry, position, tension, stiffness), 3D vocal fold vibratory dynamics, and voice outcomes in the full muscle control space including symmetric, asymmetric and compensative muscle activations. The PI’s group recently developed a state-of-the-art, physics based, 3D computer model that integrates realistic laryngeal anatomy, physiologically quantifiable inputs, inverse material parameterization and machine learning for simulating vocal fold posturing and flow-structure-acoustics interaction (FSAI) during voice production. For this project, we propose to combine this embodied model with experimental data to generate a holistic view of vocal fold posturing and FSAI with great temporal and spatial details in the full muscle control space. In particular, the model will reveal the 3D complexity of vocal fold postures and vibrations and provide measures of tension and stiffness with muscle activations, which have not been available. We propose to use the dataset to elucidate causal links among muscle activity, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold vibration and voice outcome. Muscle combinations with distinct posturing, vibration and acoustic patterns will be identified. The new knowledge is expected to elucidate the muscle control mechanism of voice production through vocal fold posturing. The proposed work has the potential to improve insight into the function and dysfunction of the ILMs and to serve as a foundation for novel, targeted therapeutic approaches. We hope to develop possible biomechanical metrics for the diagnosis and optimal methodology for treatment of VFP. Project Narrative Vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP) is the most common etiology of voice disorders which affects 9% of the U.S. population. Diagnosis and optimal treatment of VFP remain challenging because of incomplete understanding of muscle control mechanism of vocal fold posturing and vibration. This project will build causal links among muscle activation, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold vibration and voice acoustics, allowing for the development of possible biomechanical metrics for diagnosis and optimal treatment of VFP.",Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis,10299679,R15DC019229,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Biomechanics', 'Canis familiaris', 'Computer Models', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Etiology', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Paresis', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'professor', 'simulation', 'targeted treatment', 'vibration', 'vocal cord']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MAINE ORONO,R15,2021,431951
"Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States, affecting 4% of all adults over the age of 40. For individuals whose motor symptoms are refractory to medication and significantly impair their daily living, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered to be the only bilateral therapeutic option. Despite recent advances in DBS technology, a significant portion of ET patients with DBS implants will receive inadequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads, while others will lose efficacy of the therapy after 1-2 years due in part to inflexible neurostimulator programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs and programming algorithms that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields within the brain, especially in cases where stimulation through a poorly placed DBS lead results in low-threshold side-effects. Our proposed study will integrate high-field magnetic resonance imaging, histological neurotracing of fiber pathways, computational modeling of DBS, and single-cell electrophysiology methods to further develop and experimentally-validate a novel semi-automated machine learning algorithm that facilitates hypothesis-driven determination of subject-specific neurostimulator settings through directional DBS leads. Specifically, we will: 1) identify the neural pathways involved in the reduction of action and postural tremor using directional DBS leads and a novel particle swarm optimization algorithm based on subject-specific anatomy; 2) quantify how tremor-related information is modulated on the single-cell, population, and network levels by therapeutic DBS in a preclinical large-animal model of harmline-induced tremor; and 3) investigate how therapeutic windows (i.e. the threshold difference between postural and action tremor abolishment and side effect emergence) change over time with human DBS therapy targeting one or more pathways within the cerebello-thalamoc-cortical network. Together, this project will (a) experimentally evaluate and translate a novel DBS programming algorithm to human ET patients, (b) provide a much more detailed map of the neural pathways underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS (on postural and action tremor) and side effects of DBS (on dysarthria, paresthesia, ataxia), (c) rigorously investigate how DBS for treating tremor works mechanistically at the single cell and network levels within the brain, and (d) probe the neural pathways involved in the worsening of tremor symptoms for ET patients over time. NARRATIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a proven therapy for patients with medication-refractory essential tremor, but a significant portion of patients with these implants do not receive adequate tremor control because of poorly placed DBS leads or inflexible DBS programming options. There is a strong and growing clinical need for implantable DBS lead designs that can enable clinicians to better sculpt electric fields in the brain to improve the functional outcome for all patients requiring DBS to manage their essential tremor. Our research study will experimentally evaluate a novel machine learning algorithm for programming directional DBS leads implanted within thalamus to more precisely identify and effectively target the pathways and circuits involved in (a) cessation of action and postural tremor, and (b) worsening of tremor symptoms over time.",Algorithms for programming DBS systems for Essential Tremor,10246791,R01NS081118,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dysarthria', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Essential Tremor', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Harmaline', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paresthesia', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Radiation', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'United States', 'Utah', 'Work', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'deep brain stimulation array', 'density', 'design', 'electric field', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'motor symptom', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'research study', 'side effect', 'somatosensory', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'zona incerta']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,542822
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,10126727,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2021,475626
"Mapping Algorithmic State Space in the Human Brain Abstract Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to respond correctly to novel contextual situations on the first attempt, without prior rehearsal. We refer to this ability as ‘ad hoc self-programming’: ‘ad hoc’ because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; ‘self-programming’ because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. The overall goal of our research effort is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  Our previous U01 project (NS 108923) focused on how these programs of action are initially created. Our results thus far have revealed tantalizing notions of how the brain represents these programs and navigates through them. In this proposal, therefore, we focus on the question of how these mental programs are executed. Based on our preliminary findings and critical conceptual work, we propose that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) creates representations of the critical elements of these mental programs, including concepts such as ‘rules’ and ‘locations’, to allow for effective navigation through the algorithm.  These data suggest the existence of an ‘algorithmic state space’ represented in medial temporal and prefrontal regions. This proposal aims to understand the neurophysiological underpinnings of this algorithmic state space in humans. By studying humans, we will profit from our species’ powerful capacity for generalization to understand how such state spaces are constructed. We therefore leverage the unique opportunities available in human neuroscience research to record from single cells and population-level signals, as well as to use intracranial stimulation for causal testing, to address this challenging problem.  In Aim 1 we study the basic representations of algorithmic state space using a novel behavioral task that requires the immediate formation of unique plans of action. Aim 2 directly compares representations of algorithmic state space to that of physical space by juxtaposing balanced versions of spatial and algorithmic tasks in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Finally, in Aim 3, we test hypotheses regarding interactions between vPFC and MTL using intracranial stimulation. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations we have never previously faced and yet are required to make an appropriate response on the first try. This ability to rapidly and flexibly ‘self-program’ is one of the hallmark features of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.",Mapping Algorithmic State Space in the Human Brain,10199622,U01NS121472,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amaze', 'Anterior', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Cinnamon - dietary', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Link', 'Location', 'Medial', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Telemetry', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell cortex', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'design', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'mental representation', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'physical state', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rehearsal', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'way finding']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2021,1509141
"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors. n/a",CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations,10207403,R01MH122023,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'biophysical model', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'vigilance']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,284005
"Model-based neural control of brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide, with depressive disorders being the most disabling among them. Many patients are resistant to all current treatments. Invasive electrical brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression showed early promise in open-label studies but has had variable efficacy in controlled clinical trials. To date, stimulation in neuropsychiatric disorders has been limited to an open-loop approach that applies a fixed pattern of continuous stimulation regardless of symptom levels. One limitation is that open-loop stimulation does not track the inter- and intra-subject variabilities in neuropsychiatric symptoms, which can change rapidly in an individual. Another limitation is the lack of an input-output model that can guide stimulation by predicting how ongoing stimulation input drives large-scale neural activity and the symptoms it underlies in an individual. We will address these limitations to enable precise invasive electrical brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders by developing a novel real-time model-based neural control system. We will provide proof-of-concept demonstration for acute control of neural biomarkers of mood states related to depression symptoms in epilepsy patients with implanted intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) electrodes, in whom we will obtain repeated mood self-reports and perform stimulation simultaneously with neural recording. The system will continuously adjust the stimulation parameters, for the first time, based on 2 elements: (i) Novel personalized input-output model learned on recorded brain network response while delivering a new stochastic stimulation waveform to excite network activity. (ii) Personalized decoder trained on multi-day continuous iEEG recordings and simultaneous mood self-reports to estimate mood state variations from neural activity as feedback. Combining these, we will build a real-time model-based closed-loop system to precisely drive the neurally-decoded mood state—the neural biomarker of mood—to a target level. Our system generalizes to any stimulation site. Here, we will demonstrate the system with orbitofrontal stimulation as we have shown it to acutely improve mood and modulate large-scale mood-relevant brain activity. We will run real-time closed-loop experiments in each patient. The system will estimate the neural biomarker from iEEG and adjust the stimulation amplitude and frequency in real-time based on the input-output model to drive the estimated biomarker to a target level. We will also develop model-free closed-loop on-off stimulation that turns stimulation on-off based on the neural biomarker. We will compare model-based, on-off and open-loop stimulations. Success of this program will enable precisely regulating a desired brain state by developing the first model-based closed- loop invasive brain stimulation system and advancing neuromodulation technology. It will also directly inform electrical stimulation therapy in future pivotal clinical trials of refractory depression. The developed system and gained knowledge will generalize across many neuropsychiatric disorders with broad public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Direct electrical stimulation of the brain holds promise for patients with refractory neuropsychiatric conditions and in particular treatment-resistant depression but has been limited to delivering a fixed stimulation pattern and shown variable efficacy in clinical trials. We propose that one way to improve efficacy is to build a novel model- based system that adjusts the stimulation based on recording brain signals that are related to mood symptoms and modeling how ongoing stimulation changes these signals. We will develop this novel model-based system to enable personalized real-time stimulation and test it for acute control of neural biomarkers of mood states related to depression symptoms in human epilepsy patients.",Model-based neural control of brain stimulation for neuropsychiatric disorders,10209839,R01MH123770,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Trials', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Dissociation', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electric Stimulation Therapy', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Refractory', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'comorbid depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'mind control', 'mood symptom', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open label', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time model', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,626990
"Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility Project Summary Mechanoregulation is a fundamental mechanism for the control of dynamic and multiscale biological systems. A mechanoregulatory network is responsible for the motility of cilia by converting the action of thousands of individual dynein motors bound to doublet microtubules in the cilium into a single waveform. This waveform has evolved to efficiently displace fluid, allowing either cell self-propulsion or the transport of extracellular liquid over epithelial surfaces. Ciliary motility in humans is therefore essential for the movement of sperm cells, the removal of bacteria and viruses from the respiratory tract, and the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Cilia are also used by protozoan pathogens for movement, contributing to their pathogenicity. The biflagellate alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has become the model system for studying the relationship between cilia ultrastructure and ciliary motilty. Using this organism, we have determined single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the bases of dyneins and mechanoregulatory complexes natively bound to doublet microtubules. These structures map the interconnected network of microtubules, mechanoregulators, and dynein motors in unparalleled atomic detail. The structures reveal the mechanisms that dock mechanoregulators to doublet microtubules and generate new hypotheses for how they control dynein behavior. These preliminary structural studies provide a unique opportunity to better understand the structure, function and assembly pathway of the largest mechanoregulator, the radial spoke. In aim 1, I propose to elucidate the complete structure of a native radial spoke using cryo-EM and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Structural information will resolve how its 20+ unique subunits interact and function together to respond to both mechanical and chemical signals. Due to the high conservation of radial-spoke subunits among organisms, our structure will provide insights into the etiology of ciliopathy-causing mutations in humans. In aim 2, I propose to test hypotheses that have arisen from our “on-doublet” structures using an interdisciplinary combination of structure-guided mutagenesis, waveform analysis by high-speed microcinematography, and structural characterization using electron cryotomography. This work will provide experimental evidence for the fundamental molecular mechanisms that control ciliary motility. In aim 3, I propose to use a proteomic and structural approach to determine the mechanisms of radial-spoke assembly. This work will test our current structure-based model of assembly and has the potential to identify the first radial-spoke biogenesis factors. Collectively, these studies will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into the mechanoregulatory pathways that control ciliary motility and promises to open new avenues for the treatment of ciliopathies. Project Narrative Motile cilia are microtubule-based organelles that produce a driving force for cellular locomotion or fluid flow. In humans, defects in motile cilia can lead to infertility, chronic respiratory disease, and even reversal of the orientation of the bodily organs. This project aims to reveal the detailed workings of the mechanoregulatory network that controls ciliary motility, which will help us to better understand the molecular basis of cilia-related diseases.",Mechanoregulation of Ciliary Motility,10180150,R01GM141109,"['Algae', 'Animal Model', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biogenesis', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Chlamydomonas reinhardtii', 'Chronic', 'Cilia', 'Cilium Microtubule', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Electrons', 'Epithelial', 'Etiology', 'Excision', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Machines', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oocytes', 'Organ', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Radial', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory System', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell motility', 'ciliopathy', 'cilium motility', 'crosslink', 'driving force', 'extracellular', 'fluid flow', 'insight', 'nexin', 'novel', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory virus', 'sperm cell']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,414050
"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells. Our device will implement new algorithms that measure and control that rhythmic firing, restoring patterns of healthy communication.",Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks,10227769,R01MH123634,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Testing', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electronics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufactured form', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analog', 'animal safety', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'commercialization', 'conditioning', 'design', 'digital', 'emotional functioning', 'first-in-human', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'nanofabrication', 'neural circuit', 'neurotechnology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychiatric symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'safety testing', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trigonometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,871272
"Interpretable machine learning for understanding the neural control of movement Modern machine learning can fit complex models that make accurate predictions. However, understanding the brain with standard machine learning is a great challenge. A critical impediment is that it is often difficult to understand the inner workings of these models. There is thus a great need for more interpretable machine learning methods for neuroscience, in which the inner workings of the model relate to neural structure or function. The proposed research will develop interpretable machine learning methods for studying the neural control of movement. Through close collaboration with the experimental lab of Dr. Churchland, these methods will be applied to answer three central questions in motor control. In the first two aims, the research investigates how flexibly spinal motor neurons can be controlled, and how activity in motor cortex controls muscle activity across a wide range of movements. Beyond increasing scientific knowledge, answering these two questions could enhance brain computer interfaces for restoring control to those with motor impairments. In the third aim, the research investigates how multiple neural populations interact with each other to plan and generate movement. This question is relevant to many neurological disorders, in which communication between brain areas is disrupted. During the K99 phase of this award, occurring within Columbia’s vibrant neuroscience community, the applicant will receive additional training in computational techniques from Drs. Paninski and Cunningham, and additional experimental training from Dr. Churchland. This training will provide the necessary experience for the applicant to be successful in this work and to successfully start an independent lab at the interface of machine learning and the neural control of movement. While the development of many new neural recording technologies has led to much excitement, it has created a huge gap between our ability to collect data and our ability to deeply understand it. More interpretable machine learning tools are necessary for understanding neural function in health and neurological disease, to one day develop curative interventions. The goal of this research is to develop interpretable machine learning models and apply them to understand how brain areas interact with each other and how they control muscle activity during a wide range of movements.",Interpretable machine learning for understanding the neural control of movement,10106091,K99NS119787,"['Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intramuscular', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Side', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'cortex mapping', 'curative treatments', 'data structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,K99,2021,125442

"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic.

"Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces Project Abstract. Candidate and career goals: I am an engineer by training, with a strong background in neural engineering and the development of motor brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). My career goal is to establish an independent nonhuman primate (NHP) laboratory with two primary aims. First, I will advance our fundamental understanding of the motor system via the combination of electrophysiology with novel statistical and computational methods. Second, I will leverage this knowledge to develop frameworks for superior BMI systems.  Throughout my academic and research career I have developed expertise in engineering, computation, and neuroscience with the goal of pursuing these aims. Advances in machine learning, large-scale neural recordings, and deep learning in neural networks are happening quickly (in part via the BRAIN Initiative), and are very promising for the field. Yet very few researchers have the correct combination of skills to make use of them in my areas of interest. In completing the proposed training, I will be uniquely positioned to perform the innovative work necessary to advance our understanding of the planning and execution of cortically controlled movements. I will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in the experimental and computational methods necessary to understand fundamental principles of cortical computations.  Research plan: In this project, I will employ multiple computational approaches to understand the structure of population activity in motor cortex (M1) across multiple kinds of behaviors. I will then use that knowledge to create high performance BMI decoders that will be applicable to a wide range of movements.  Recent empirical observations are changing our view of the structure of M1 activity. During one particular task (e.g., reaching), neural activity may seem to exist within a small space that it explores completely. Yet as more tasks are observed, it becomes clear that activity comprises a highly structured geometry within a much larger space. This means that activity patters for different movements do not come ‘near’ one another or overlap. While counterintuitive, this geometry yields new opportunities. By exploiting the separation of activity patterns, movements can be readily distinguished, even when unfolding simultaneously. I will further explore this geometry across multiple behaviors, both in primates and neural network models, to develop new BMI methods. The specific aims of the plan are to (1) create a high-performance decoder for a novel wheelchair-relevant navigation task, (2) build network models to understand M1 activity structure and identify decoding principles that will generalize across tasks (reaching, navigation), and (3) implement a multitask BMI using a unified decoder that allows animals to both navigate and interact with objects. Career development plan: I will be trained by Dr. Mark Churchland and Dr. Larry Abbott at Columbia University. Project Narrative Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret brain activity to control external devices (computers, prosthetic limbs), and can restore voluntary movement to individuals with limb loss or paralysis. BMIs for reaching and grasping have been demonstrated in human clinical trials, and must now be extended to perform a variety of movements. The proposed work will use advanced computational methods to create an intuitively controllable and high performance BMI system applicable to many natural movements, including locomotion. This work will both develop neurotechnology, and add to our scientific understanding of the computational principles that underlie activity in motor cortex.",Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces,10126071,K99NS115919,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'career development', 'combat', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'limb loss', 'meetings', 'mind control', 'multitask', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2021,136242
"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure.

"Real-time visualization and precision targeting in transcranial magnetic stimulation Project Summary Title: Real-time visualization and precision targeting in transcranial magnetic stimulation Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive device-based neuromodulation technique for probing neuronal networks and treating mental disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The treatment efficacy of TMS relies on placing TMS coils to accurately stimulate the underlying disease-related brain target. Since TMS-evoked electric field (E-field) is affected by complex tissue structures and brain geometry, it relies on using computational algorithms, such as boundary element modeling (BEM) and finite element modeling (FEM), to estimate the stimulation site. But the relative long computation time of these methods is a limitation for real-time visualization of the stimulation target during brain mapping and for computing the optimal coil position for treatment planning. In this grant, we propose to develop a deep-neural-network based method to accelerate E-field prediction. We will develop a novel deep-neural- network architecture to predict E-field by using training data computed using the FEM algorithm with anisotropic tissue conductivity. Then, we will integrate the trained neural network into a 3DSlicer software module for real- time E-field visualization. Moreover, we will develop a computational algorithm to search for the optimal coil position to maximize the stimulation of a selected brain target within a clinically feasible time. The outcome of this grant will transform deep-learning techniques into a useful tool to enhance the application of TMS in clinical research.

"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",10188391,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2021,289385
"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,10115818,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Color', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'data integration', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mental function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective attention', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,530307
"An Open Source Simulator for Multi Degree-Of-Freedom Brain-Machine Interfaces PROJECT SUMMARY For millions with movement disorders including paralysis and ALS, intracortical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are an emerging technology that aims to restore lost motor function and communication. The main component of a BMI is a decoder algorithm that translates neural activity from motor areas of the brain into the kinematics of a prosthetic device. Due to the complexity of these systems, which includes the BMI user interacting with the decoded kinematics in a closed-feedback loop, current technology requires expensive and invasive experiments to design, optimize, and validate decoder algorithms. The need for such experiments (1) results in slow develop- ment and evaluation of decoder algorithms, and (2) limits the scope of people who can work on these problems to a small group of nonhuman primate and clinical trial labs. As a consequence, BMIs have remained in pilot clinical trials since their ﬁrst reported demonstration in 2004. We propose a new open-source simulator for multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) BMI systems. The goals of this simulator are to (1) reduce the time it takes to evaluate and optimize BMI algorithms from months to minutes, and (2) signiﬁcantly expand the community of researchers who develop testable algorithms for BMIs. To build the simulator, we propose neural encoding models that generate synthetic motor cortical activity for multiple DOF tasks. This is possible because neural population activity is relatively low-dimensional and has dynamics, which can be learned via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We build our neural simulators using data collected from human clinical trials during point-to-point multi-DOF reaches. We also propose to develop new models of human controllers. This solves an important problem in BMIs: users learn new control strategies when controlling a particular BMI decoder algorithm. Our simulator uses deep imitation and reinforcement learning to solve this problem. It is constrained through imitation learning to perform actions like a human. It is optimized through reinforcement learning to explore new strategies – under the constraint of being human-like – to optimally control the BMI. Together, we expect these innovations will result in a purely software simulator that accurately predicts BMI performance and enables design and optimization. This tool will be open-sourced and available to all, enabling widespread development of BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE For people who have lost the ability to move due to movement disorders, including paralysis and ALS, intracor- tical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore movement and communication by directly decoding neural activity from motor regions of the brain. We propose to accelerate and democratize BMI research by building a computational simulator, implemented entirely in software, that enables researchers around the world to design and optimize BMI decoder algorithms. We expect this tool will reduce BMI evaluation time from months to min- utes, and by being widely available and open source to all, considerably increase the intracortical BMI research community.",An Open Source Simulator for Multi Degree-Of-Freedom Brain-Machine Interfaces,10183995,R01NS121097,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Paralysed', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'mind control', 'neurosurgery', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'open source', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,394812
"Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures Epileptic seizures are unpredictable events that significantly reduce quality of life. Predicting when the next seizure would occur could both prepare persons with epilepsy and their caregivers, and potentially aid in the treatment of seizures. Animal models of epilepsy provide an opportunity to explore the nature of brain activity in the period leading up to seizures. Using both mouse and rat models of generalized absence epilepsy, we have found a specific build up of thalamic neural spiking activity for several seconds before each seizure. This novel electrophysiological signature occurs in the absence of any overt epileptiform EEG activity. We propose to identify the neural circuits that are responsible for pre-seizure activity using high-density multi-channel silicon probes to record broadly across seizure-generating networks in the mouse. We will also measure calcium ion levels, a readout of neural activity, in neuronal cell bodies and their output axons using fluorescent calcium indicators (GCaMPs) and multiphoton microscopy to capture a highly complementary component of pre-seizure activity with high spatial resolution. Neural activity data will be collected together with EEG, locomotion signals, sensory-evoked responses, and pupil diameter to create a comprehensive multimodal stream of pre-seizure activity. This information will be fed into unbiased machine learning approaches to develop predictive algorithms. We will directly test coupling strength within thalamocortical pre-seizure networks by conducting network-level and targeted single-cell recordings in acute brain slices. To determine a specific role of pre- seizure networks in generating seizures, we will test whether chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of key pre-seizure network elements reduces seizure incidence or severity. Finally, we will test whether we can use seizure-predictive signals to intervene in real-time and prevent seizures before they take hold. Together, these experiments will provide proof of concept for a novel therapeutic approach: targeting the pre-seizure state to improve seizure control. The unpredictable nature of seizures is a burden on persons with epilepsy and their caregivers. Using animal models of absence epilepsy, we propose to test new methods for a) predicting when the next seizure will occur and b) using this information to prevent seizures from occurring.",Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures,10269920,R01NS117150,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Calcium ion', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clozapine', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dissection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Oxides', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'SCN8A gene', 'Seizures', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Virus', 'awake', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'density', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,424577
