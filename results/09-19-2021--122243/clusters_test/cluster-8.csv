"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We propose a novel strategy to develop a class of integrated quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) that create highly accurate physical models for complex biomolecular simulations. Com- bined with recently developed high-precision free energy simulation and analysis tools, the pro- posed QMFFs will overcome current critical barriers to progress for drug discovery and deliver accurate and precise predictions for drug binding afﬁnity to enhance lead optimization. The pro- posed work will be applied to understand ligand-protein binding in the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), and provide insight that may guide the design of new non-covalent and targeted covalent inhibitors to MIF and other systems.",Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications,10202634,R01GM107485,"['Affinity', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Books', 'Cations', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Free Energy', 'Halogens', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lead optimization', 'macrophage', 'mechanical force', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,322545
"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018.  Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu- nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.  Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes. This project develops cutting-edge computational methods for the predictions of RNA structures and interactions. The results from the project will lead to novel computational tools for understanding disease mechanism at molecular level and for the rational design of RNA-based therapeutics. !",New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures,10130568,R35GM134919,"['Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hybrids', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Physics', 'Play', 'RNA', 'RNA Computations', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene therapy', 'genomic RNA', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'polyanion', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2021,496674
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,10160925,R35GM133462,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'BCAR1 gene', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Floods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microprocessor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Transcript', 'base', 'clinical application', 'design', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'single cell analysis', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2021,385000
"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10159864,R01AI148740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Capsid', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Encapsulated', 'Equilibrium', 'Failure', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'dimer', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lead optimization', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'programs', 'protein oligomer', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success', 'viral genomics']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,393060
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,10167719,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,310328
"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we aim to bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This approach will bring statistical rigor to the ﬁeld of force ﬁeld construction and application by providing a means to make data-driven decisions, while enhancing reproducibility by enabling it to become a rigorous and reproducible science using a fully open infrastructure and datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life do their jobs. They also use simulations to help design new medications – compounds that can bind and inﬂuence the behavior of these molecules of life, and thereby block diseases at the molecular level. We aim to greatly increase the utility of all of these simulations by improving the accuracy of the formulas they use to compute the forces acting between atoms.",Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design,10105344,R01GM132386,"['Address', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Occupations', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biophysical model', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'data infrastructure', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'macromolecule', 'models and simulation', 'molecular mechanics', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'nucleic acid-based therapeutics', 'open data', 'open source', 'physical model', 'physical property', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'small molecule', 'software infrastructure', 'sound', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2021,608856
"Enabling the Accelerated Discovery of Novel Chemical Probes by Integration of Crystallographic, Computational, and Synthetic Chemistry Approaches ABSTRACT Identification of high-quality chemical probes, molecules with high specificity and selectivity against macromolecules, is of critical interest to drug discovery. Although millions of compounds have been screened against thousands of protein targets, small-molecule probes are currently available for only 4% of the human proteome. Thus, more efficient approaches are required to accelerate the development of novel, target-specific probes. In 2019, a new bold initiative called “Target 2035” was launched with the goal of “creating […] chemical probes, and/or functional antibodies for the entire proteome” by 2035. In support of this ambitious initiative, we propose to develop and test a novel integrative AI-driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein. Here, we will build an integrative workflow where the unique XChem database of experimental crystallographic information describing the pose and nature of chemical fragments binding to the target protein will be used in several innovative computational approaches to predict the structure of organic molecules with high affinity towards specific targets. The candidate molecules will be experimentally validated and then optimized, using computational algorithms, into lead molecules to seed chemical probe development. The proposed project is structured around three following interrelated keystones: (i) Develop a novel method for ligand-binding hot-spot identification and discovery of novel chemical probe candidates; (ii) Develop novel fragment-based integrative computational approach for accelerated de novo design of chemical probes; (iii) Consensus prediction of target-specific ligands, synthesis, and experimental validation of computational hits.  More specifically, we will develop a hybrid method to predict structures of high-affinity ligands for proteins for which XChem fragment screens have been completed. These approaches will be used for screening of ultra- large (>10 billion) chemical libraries to identify putative high affinity ligands within crystallographically determined pockets. Then, we will develop and employ an approach using graph convolutional neural networks for de novo design of a library of strong binders that will be evaluated to select the best candidates for chemical optimization. Finally, we will combine traditional structure-based and novel approaches, developed in this project to select consensus hit compounds against three target proteins: transcription factor brachyury, hydrolase NUDT5, and bromodomain BAZ2B. Iterative design guided by the computational algorithms, synthesis, and testing will progressively optimize molecules to micromolar leads to chemical probes for the target proteins.  Completion of the proposed aims will deliver a robust integrative workflow to identify leads for chemical probes against diverse target proteins. We expect that our AI-based computational approach to convert crystallographically-determined chemical fragments into lead compounds coupled with the experimental validation of computational algorithms will accelerate the discovery of new chemical probes, expand the druggable proteome, and support future drug discovery studies PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is devoted to the development of a novel integrative, structure-based, artificial intelligence driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein.

"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,10197115,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,10093062,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,393339
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Systematic identification of RNA sequences and protein components regulating circular RNA translation PROJECT SUMMARY  The human genome encodes tens of thousands of circRNAs, of which the translation is essential for regulating important biological functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Interference with circRNA translation can lead to tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancers. It is unclear, however, how disrupting circRNA translation can cause the diseases. Identifying the regulatory components of circRNA translation can provide valuable clinical insights. However, current technologies cannot distinguish circRNAs from linear RNAs efficiently, such that the mechanism and molecular components regulating circRNA translation remain unclear. Thus, it is imperative to develop a technology that can identify the components regulating circRNA translation with higher sensitivity and specificity.  I have developed a high-throughput reporter screening assay that can systematically screen and identify the RNA sequences that initiate circRNA translation specifically. Utilizing the technology, I discovered two groups of the RNA sequences that specifically drive translation on either circRNA or linear RNA, respectively, indicating that the regulatory components between linear RNA and circRNA translation are different (Chen et al., resubmitted to Science). In this proposed research, I will further adapt and apply this novel technology to (i) identify and characterize the sequence and protein components that regulate circRNA translation specifically, (ii) identify the association between genetic variation, circRNA translation, and disease, (iii) characterize circRNA translation in a tissue-dependent manner systematically, and (iv) build a non-integrative and stable gene expression platform with tunable expression level and tissue specificity. This proposed research will build the foundation of my future research as an independent researcher to investigate the regulation and the coordination between different translation machinery (cap-dependent vs. independent translation) among different RNA species (linear vs. circular RNAs).  This work will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Howard Chang at the Stanford University School of Medicine, an expert in technology development and RNA biology who has highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions. Further training in scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs, which provide an outstanding intellectually- stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success. All proposed training will complement my previous training in RNA biology, technology development, and computer programming and facilitate my transition to an independent researcher, investigating the functions, regulations and clinical implications of circRNA.

"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Importantly, our methods will broaden the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing techniques.",Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM,10163220,R01GM136780,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bypass', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drug Design', 'Fostering', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Pumps', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Machines', 'Molecular Motors', 'Molecular Weight', 'Motion', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Particle Size', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliceosomes', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular mass', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,312940
"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,10126805,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2021,1224163
"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop the experimental and computational requisites for identifying inosine modifications in nanopore native RNA sequencing data, particularly for illuminating the interplay between A-to-I editing, alternative splicing, and mRNA regulation.",Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads,10168450,F31HG010999,"['Address', 'Adenosine', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acids', 'Atlases', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breast', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enzymes', 'Exons', 'Functional disorder', 'Guanosine', 'Human', 'Inosine', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurons', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Poly(A) Tail', 'Polyadenylation', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'base', 'career', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional outcomes', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'machine learning method', 'nanopore', 'neuron loss', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2021,38613
"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,10158011,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2021,31030
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,10116306,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'antibody test', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,591130
"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",10200091,R01GM132595,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Ions', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Binding', 'Ontology', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'density', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'online resource', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,561173
"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10259801,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,399375
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,10152659,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,556806
"Measuring allele and isoform-specific RBP binding to improve predictive models of RNA splicing PROJECT SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental cellular process that regulates 95% of multi-exon genes to diversify protein output and define cell-type specific functions. Both constitutive splicing and AS are controlled by combinations of cis-acting pre-messenger RNA sequences (pre-mRNA) and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Therefore, defects in splicing regulatory RNA sequence or RBPs can be highly disruptive to basic cellular activities and often lead to disease, especially neurological and muscular disorders and cancer. While the constitutive splicing code is well established, the AS code is more complicated and, thus, poorly understood. This proposal integrates multiple cutting-edge approaches to take an RBP-centric view of AS to study both cis genetic variants and trans RBP expression effects on RBP binding and splicing outcome. While thousands of non-coding genetic variants are associated with splicing variation, and are thus termed putative splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), the causal variants and their molecular effects, such as RBP binding, are largely unclear. Aim 1 will address this gap by integrating RBP-focused experiments, allele-specific genomics, and state- of-the-art machine learning predictive models to characterize an important category of functional, cis non-coding variants that alter RBP binding. Importantly, I will take a unique approach to include these allele-specific RBP binding data as additional training data for our Convolutional Neural Net model. Model output is expected to much more accurately predict functional RBP binding effects of even a single nucleotide change in sequence, enabling improved interpretation of sQTLs. In addition to genetic variant effects, changes in RBP expression can have amplified downstream effects on RNA splicing. Interestingly, ~86% of RBP genes can be expressed as more than one splice isoform, but most studies to date have ignored RBP isoform-specific abundance and function. Aim 2 will provide foundational experiments to understand differential RBP isoform effects by using a novel approach to knockdown RBP isoforms by targeting Cas13 to unique exon junctions. Data from downstream assays that assess changes in RBP binding, splicing, and RNA localization will be integrated to construct the most comprehensive RBP regulatory networks to date. Results from both aims are essential to mechanistically link RNA sequence and RBP binding to splicing outcome and, ultimately, to phenotype and disease. My long-term goal is to become a principal investigator, where I will continue to leverage molecular biology, machine learning, and statistical genetics to answer unique questions about RNA-mediated associations between non-coding sequence and cellular and disease phenotype. The research and training plans proposed here are strategically tailored to provide ample opportunities to learn and apply machine learning and statistical genetics methods that complement my former PhD training in molecular biology and genomics. My sponsor, co- sponsor, and collaborators at the NYGC are committed to providing the scientific expertise, computational training, and career development mentoring to ensure the successful achievement of my goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Splicing is one of the earliest RNA processing events that regulates nearly every gene in every cell, thereby driving cell-type diversity and function. Mis-regulation at the level of splicing due to genetic variants in RNA sequence or defects in regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are highly disruptive to basic molecular processes and often lead to disease. This proposal aims to mechanistically link genetic variants and RBP effects to splicing outcome to improve interpretation of consortia-level DNA and RNA sequencing data as it relates to phenotypic traits and disease.",Measuring allele and isoform-specific RBP binding to improve predictive models of RNA splicing,10234638,F32GM142213,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Myopathy', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Splicing', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Ribonucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'career development', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'convolutional neural network', 'differential expression', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'molecular phenotype', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'nuclease', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,F32,2021,65994
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling,10405893,R00HG010910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Biological Transport', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterochromatin', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Motors', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Outer Mitochondrial Membrane', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'active control', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'cell fixation', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education resources', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genomic tools', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanometer', 'neuropathology', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'ribosome profiling', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R00,2021,249000
