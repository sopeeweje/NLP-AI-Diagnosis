"CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Project Summary/Abstract Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In determine an exploratory ML analysis, we will the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are strongly linked t o functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10136105,R01MH120091,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,317000
"Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic tic disorders (referred to here as Tourette syndrome: TS) are complex and often serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics. Tics are brief, repetitive, unwanted movements or noises, which can severely impinge upon quality of life. While TS was once thought to be relatively rare, recent epidemiological studies find that 1-6% of all children meet criteria for a chronic tic disorder, making it a significant public health problem. Typically in TS, tics begin around age 5-7 years old, peak in severity around age 10-12 years, and improve throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, not all patients show this improvement during adolescence, as ~30% continue to experience significant impairment into adulthood. Thus, the years during and immediately following peak symptom severity represent a critical time for TS, during which individuals may show considerable improvement or not. Surprisingly little research has targeted this critical developmental stage of TS. Moreover, longitudinal investigations of predictors of TS outcome have focused primarily on single variables (e.g., caudate nucleus volume or tic severity). Yet there is considerable evidence that the neurobiology of TS is quite complex, involving interactions within and between multiple brain networks. For example, our preliminary findings demonstrate stronger brain functional connectivity among cognitive control networks and motor networks, as well as altered white and gray matter volumes in prefrontal and subcortical regions in TS. Using this complex information may be more informative for understanding tic severity changes and predicting clinical outcome. We propose a longitudinal study in which we will capture the developmental stage of TS with the greatest likelihood of change in tic severity (beginning at age 10-12 years), and will follow these children to track the development of brain and cognitive features, and how they relate to symptom change, over time. To capture the complex neurobiology of TS, we will collect whole-brain resting state functional connectivity, structural MRI, cognitive, and clinical data from a group of children with TS. We will compare these children to tic-free controls (from the NIH's ABCD Study Washington University site subject pool), as comparison to typical development will be essential for interpreting longitudinal changes in TS. We will target diagnostic differences and developmental changes in specific functional brain networks, regional brain volumes, and cognitive abilities. We will also use multivariate machine learning methods to unify this rich dataset to classify and make predictions about individual children. This approach analyzes complex patterns of multidimensional data rather than single variables, providing the potential for clinical utility and to contribute converging evidence about mechanism. Identifying mechanisms underlying symptom change will provide insight into why many children with TS improve while some do not, potentially yielding new targets for treatment and predictive indicators of persistent tics. Markers of symptom improvement could be targeted to treat children who do not improve. Being able to make predictions about individual children could identify those children who need those interventions most. We have expertise with every step of the proposed study, but the application to longitudinal data over the first half of the second decade of life is novel. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children with Tourette syndrome (TS) follow varying clinical courses, as some will experience substantial improvement over the course of adolescence while others will continue to experience significant impairment. Understanding the brain and cognitive features that mediate or predict different outcomes could revolutionize prognosis and treatment. This project will study children with and without TS over time, during the key ages of 10 to 14 years, to (1) investigate how brain and cognitive markers of TS develop over adolescence and relate to changes in symptom severity, and (2) make predictions about future symptom severity for individual children.",Longitudinal Study of Brain Imaging and Cognitive Markers of Tourette Syndrome in Children,10220354,R01MH118217,"['12 year old', '7 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Tics', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocal Tics', 'Washington', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain volume', 'caudate nucleus', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'mind control', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'putamen', 'symptomatic improvement', 'white matter']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,559759
"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,10131234,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",10149406,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Poverty', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2021,367436
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",10152666,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'genetic testing', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,788885
"Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding Project Summary Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre- clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females and was predictive of improved extinction retention. A better understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We propose here to define the neural circuitry that drives the selection of conditioned darting vs. freezing, and how that integrates with known extinction circuits to promote extinction retention. Our preliminary data implicate the infralimbic cortex (IL) in this role, and we will use pharmacological, chemogenetic, and viral techniques to probe how descending IL projections to the dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray (PAG) may mediate a strategic switch between active and passive responding and drive long-term behavioral flexibility through putative collaterals in the amygdala. We will then use sophisticated machine vision and machine learning-based tools to define the broader behavioral repertoires within which darting exists, thereby identifying a multifaceted phenotype that could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability. Project Narrative Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the risk factors that promote disease susceptibility may be distinct in men and women. This project explores the neurobiological basis of divergent (active vs. passive) fear responses in males and females, which could help identify novel ways to prevent or treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding,10223137,R01MH123803,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Crete', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dorsal', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FOS gene', 'Female', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Rattus', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sex Differences', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'male', 'men', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress resilience', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,445292
"Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making PROJECT SUMMARY Much work in decision neuroscience has been predicated on the hypothesis that dopaminergic signaling plays a critical role in value representations and their updating, and recent work has linked abnormalities in such value representations to specific features of psychiatric illness (e.g., anhedonia in major depression). However, despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Indirect evidence from pharmacological studies have suggested both serotoninergic and noradrengergic signaling may play roles in representations of risk; however, direct measurement of serotonin or norepinephrine signaling during risky choice has yet to be examined in humans. Recent advances by MPI Montague’s group allow the unprecedented ability to track neuromodulator responses with high temporal resolution and chemical specificity. Specifically, MPI Montague’s team is able to directly and simultaneously measure dopamine and serotonin responses in awake humans with the temporal resolution (~ 1 ms) required to examine the relationship of neuromodulator release with decision-making processes. For signal identification and extraction, the recording method uses machine-learning algorithms (elastic net regression) combined with electrochemistry using only off-the shelf hardware and software. The product of this ‘elastic net electrochemistry’ is recordings of in vivo neuromodulator fluctuations at sub-second resolution. This application merges the decision neuroscience expertise of MPI King-Casas with these advances of MPI Montague to directly examine serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic functioning during risky choice. To achieve this goal, we will record neuromodulator responses in participants with medication-resistant epilepsy who already have intracranial depth electrodes in place for phase-II monitoring. Depth electrodes will be implanted by our neurosurgery colleagues at Virginia Tech’s medical affiliate Carilion Clinic (Carilion Clinic PI: Witcher). During recording, participants will perform i) a risk elicitation task (Holt & Laury type task) and ii) a reward learning task (multi-arm bandit task) that have been shown by our group and others both to reliably evoke neural responses associated with risk and representations as they are monitored in a standard (i.e., non-surgical) hospital suite. Depth recordings will be made using a standard montage that includes multiple contacts along the dorsal-rostral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Here, we take advantage of a new technology to directly measure serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine on a sub-second basis to investigate the neurocomputational role of these neurotransmitters in risky choice.",Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making,10141302,R01MH122948,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Dopamine', 'Dorsal', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morale', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology Study', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'noradrenergic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2021,654439
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief. These findings may advance understanding of the process of grief, facilitate early identification of high-risk grievers and potentially form the basis for targeted treatment of complicated grief.",Predicting complicated grief from grief processing,10124433,K23MH114021,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Down-Regulation', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Guilt', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Reaction Time', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Stimulus', 'Suicide', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Trauma', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intense pain', 'loved ones', 'neural patterning', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2021,199800
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood. This project seeks to identify early antecedents and risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders and to understand the processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically signficant psychopathology.

"Personalized Mapping of Affective Lability PROJECT SUMMARY Affective lability (AL) is a common psychiatric symptom characterized by rapid mood fluctuations. Clinically significant AL often begins in adolescence, is present in both psychiatric disorders and the general population, and is a major risk factor for suicide. However, the developmental substrates of AL remain only sparsely described. Prior studies have implicated deficits of top-down regulation between the frontoparietal network (FPN) and the amygdala; the FPN is also known to undergo protracted maturation into young adulthood. However, previous efforts have been limited by methodological obstacles related to underlying biological heterogeneity of the FPN. Cortical networks have typically been studied using standardized network atlases, which assume a 1:1 mapping between structural and functional neuroanatomy across individuals. However, recent studies using precision functional mapping techniques have demonstrated reliable individual differences in functional topography, i.e., the spatial distribution of functional networks on the cortex. Notably, the FPN is both critical for affect regulation and also has the most variable functional topography of any cortical network. This proposal will capitalize upon new machine learning tools to map the FPN on a personalized basis to test the over-arching hypothesis that AL is associated with developmental abnormalities of FPN topography and connectivity. In Aim 1, we will continue to acquire a sample of 30 adolescents and young adults (ages 16-21) with affective lability and 20 matched comparators using smartphone-based digital phenotyping and multi- modal imaging. In Aim 2, we will capitalize upon a recently-completed longitudinal study (n=200, 10-25 years old, mean follow up interval = 5 years) that will allow us to understand how longitudinal changes in personalized FPN topography and connectivity associate with AL. Taken together, this project will provide valuable new insights regarding circuit-level developmental deficits associated with AL, and provide the candidate with superb training in computational psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE Affective lability is a common symptom of multiple psychiatric conditions in youth and is one of the strongest predictors of suicide. Here, we propose to use machine learning tools to identify circuit-level deficits associated with affective lability in individual adolescents and young adults. This knowledge may be critical for the development of personalized therapeutics for the treatment of affective lability.",Personalized Mapping of Affective Lability,10140765,F31MH123063,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'biological heterogeneity', 'burden of illness', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'common symptom', 'digital', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'personalized therapeutic', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'stem', 'tool', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,46036
"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,10171413,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical center', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,575613
"ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES Specific Aims: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, comorbid, and challenging to treat, ranking them among the greatest contributors to human suffering. An early-life extreme inhibited or anxious temperament, characterized by behavioral inhibition and extreme physiological responses to novel and/or potentially threatening contexts, is among the strongest predictors of the later development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of this early-life risk will identify treatment targets and provide a unique opportunity to develop scientifically founded behavioral and pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent stress-related psychopathology. Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal study in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to understand how inborn risk-factors and early-life inhibition lead to anxiety and maladaptive social behavior during adolescence and early adulthood. We will do this by leveraging the resources at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), including previous early-life assessments of behavioral inhibition, a multi-generational family pedigree, and large outdoor housing, alongside cutting-edge tools and analysis techniques, including multimodal neuroimaging and neural network-based animal tracking and behavioral analyses. We will use a prospective longitudinal design, and select 176 NHPs (88 F) previously phenotyped for early-life inhibition (3-4 months old) from the CNPRC’s large, multi-generational family pedigree. To study the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like symptomatology, half of the NHPs will be ""adolescents"" and half will be ""young adults"". We will perform in-lab behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, and longitudinal large-scale monitoring as animals navigate the entirety of their socio-geographic environment. First, we will examine how heritable-risk and early- life inhibition contribute to maladaptive socio-emotional behaviors in ecologically-valid contexts during adolescence and early adulthood (Aim 1). Starting in puberty, the risk for anxiety disorders is greater for girls than boys. Therefore, we also aim to demonstrate adolescent and young-adult sex differences in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 2). To understand how these factors are mediated by alterations in relevant brain circuitry, including the extended amygdala, each animal will undergo multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging assessments. Using these data, we will test specific hypotheses regarding the extent to which extended amygdala circuits link early-life inhibition to the progression of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 3). This combination of approaches promises to provide unprecedented insight into the neural substrates of maladaptive socio-emotional behavior during the transition to adulthood. PROJECT NARRATIVE A key challenge for psychiatry and clinical psychology is to discover, understand, and ultimately treat the root causes of the most common mental illness, including anxiety and depressive disorders. This project will harness an innovative combination of longitudinal measures and state-of-the-art tools—including a multi-generational pedigree, brain imaging, and deep neural networks—to objectively identify and prioritize the pathways that contribute to maladaptive social behavior as individuals mature into adults.

"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures. We will explore the causal effects of orphanhood by comparing children who lost parents in the tsunami with those in the same community who did not. Project Narrative This project will field the fifteen year follow up of the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR), a large-scale longitudinal study of individuals differentially exposed to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The data provide unique information on the evolution of population health of a group of 27,000 individuals first interviewed before the tsunami, including biomarker measurements and integrated information on environmental change.",Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status,10250551,R01HD052762,"['Adolescence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Child Welfare', 'Cicatrix', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Data', 'Disasters', 'Documentation', 'Earthquakes', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Household', 'Imagery', 'Indian Ocean', 'Individual', 'Indonesia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Natural Disasters', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Public Domains', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Rest', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Shock', 'Siblings', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Sumatra', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Tsunami', 'Variant', 'Water', 'acetone hydrazone', 'adverse childhood events', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'environmental change', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'human capital', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'member', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'sea level rise', 'success', 'tool', 'weather patterns', 'young adult']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,498320
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate.

"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,10202572,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical examination', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2021,546783
"A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently one of the most critical public health threats. As such there is an urgent need to identify new ways to reduce AMR transmission. In recent years, several studies have started to reveal the complex relations and interactions between antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and the human microbiome. The human microbiome plays profound roles in responding to antibiotic treatment and the transmission of ARGs. The altered microbiome, especially in children, may have a distinct resistome (the entire ARGs in the microbiome community). Infants and young children receive frequent antimicrobial courses for common respiratory infections and are thought to spread ARGs effectively in the community. Otitis media is the most common reason for antimicrobial treatment in children. The antibiotic treatment that is selected for use in young children may significantly influence AMR spread in the communities. To date, there are a limited number of prospective, controlled comparative studies on how selected antibiotics affect the development of antibiotic resistance in the microbiome in young children. It is not possible to investigate children in an experimental way and expose them to antibiotics without an indication for the treatment. Non-severe acute otitis media, however, is an excellent clinical model to investigate the impact of different antimicrobial agents, since clinical guidelines suggest several alternative approaches to treat children, including watchful waiting without antibiotics. In this study, we will investigate the impact of the most commonly used antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome, and in particular the resistome in children with otitis media. The Oulu University study is IRB approved and has started enrolling infants and young children with non-severe otitis media in a study cohort and plan to finish the enrollment within the first few months of this project. Children are randomly allocated in four antibiotic treatment groups to compare the impact of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin, or no treatment on the intestinal microbiome and ARGs. We will solicit the antibiotic exposure during lifetime and collect stool samples before (day 0) and three days after the antibiotic course (day 10). We will apply quantitative PCR, 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing on different platforms to characterize the microbiome and resistome over time. De novo genome assembly based on Oxford Nanopore long reads technology, combined with high depth Illumina sequencing will reveal the details of ARGs and gene variants between species, and between microbiome communities, and show us novel mobile elements containing ARGs, which may be potentially transferred horizontally between species. We will apply machine learning approaches to quantitatively study how each bacterial species responds to and survives under antibiotic exposure, by analyzing genomic variants in ARGs, changes in three dimensional structure of the key ARGs, ARG network and pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a growing threat for public health. This proposal involves a randomized, controlled study of how the human microbiome in young children responds to different antimicrobial agents and will reveal possible genomic mechanisms by which this occurs thereby providing insight into potential new approaches to address the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children,10113538,R21AI151730,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Amoxicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Azithromycin', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Clavulanate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infant', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Otitis Media', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Pattern', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'antimicrobial', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'clinical care', 'colonization resistance', 'design', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'fecal microbiome', 'genetic variant', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'insight', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'randomized controlled study', 'recruit', 'resistance gene', 'stool sample', 'three dimensional structure', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment group']",NIAID,"J.

"Characterizing resilience to food-cue induced overeating in children Project Summary: While strong empirical evidence shows that exposure to food advertisements increases short-term food intake and contributes to the development of obesity, not all children are susceptible to this effect. Identifying the characteristics that protect some children from overeating in response to food advertising is a public health priority that may highlight novel targets for childhood obesity prevention. We propose to use state-of-the art, data driven techniques to identify neural, cognitive and behavioral phenotypes that are associated with resiliency to food-cue induced overeating and determine whether these phenotypes protect children from weight gain during the critical pre-adolescent period. The driving premise of this proposal is that children who are resistant to food-cue induced overeating will exhibit a distinct cluster of neural, behavioral, and cognitive traits which protect them from weight gain in an obesogenic environment. Our preliminary studies suggest that greater neural activation in prefrontal cortical regions implicated in cognitive control, increased executive functioning, and lower food advertising exposure may be some of the characteristics that confer resiliency to overeating in response to food advertising cues. To confirm our preliminary findings, we plan to enroll 140, 7-8 year-old children with healthy weight who vary by risk for obesity (70 low-risk/both parents with healthy weight; 70 high-risk/both parents with obesity) for a 1-year prospective study. In aim one, we will compare the effect of exposing children to commercials (i.e., food, toy, and non-rewarding advertisements) on subsequent neural activation and network connectivity characteristics in response to viewing high-energy food cues. We hypothesize that exposure to food commercials (vs. toy and non-food) will reduce prefrontal cortex activation, but that there will be substantial variability in this response across children. In aim two, we will determine how food commercials affect children’s subsequent food intake at both homeostatic (i.e., ad libitum test-meals) and non-homeostatic (i.e., eating palatable snacks when not hungry) eating events and relate these responses to underlying neural circuitry. In aim three, we will test the extent to which children’s executive function and prior food advertising experience moderate the relationship between food commercial exposure and subsequent neural and behavioral outcomes. In the final aim, we will use sophisticated data-driven techniques (i.e., machine learning) to identify neural, behavioral, and cognitive traits that moderate the effect of familial risk status on weight-gain. We expect the proposed studies to inform the science of obesity prevention by identifying specific modifiable phenotypes that protect high-risk children from excess weight gain during the pre-adolescent period. The overall impact of these studies will be to identify novel neural and behavioral characteristics of resiliency to food advertising in children. It will be the first to focus specifically on characterizing neural resiliency factors associated with decreased risk of food-cue induced eating and determine the extent to which these factors protect pre-adolescent children from the development of obesity. Project Narrative: Reducing excess food consumption in response to food advertising is a public health goal for preventing excess weight gain and the development of obesity in children. Food marketing is a major contributor to childhood obesity, and the proposed research will identify neurobiological and behavioral characteristics that protect some children from overeating in the presence of this cue. These findings will have direct implications for the development of more effective strategies to reduce energy intake for the prevention of obesity.",Characterizing resilience to food-cue induced overeating in children,10049781,R01DK126050,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Advertisements', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Energy', 'Foundations', 'Hyperphagia', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Palate', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention program', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure of postcentral gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toy', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'design', 'eating in absence of hunger', 'excessive weight gain', 'executive function', 'experience', 'food consumption', 'food marketing', 'health goals', 'healthy weight', 'hedonic', 'high risk', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'preadolescence', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health priorities', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'trait']",NIDDK,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,603724
"Leveraging computational models of neurocognition to improve predictions about individual youths' risk for substance use disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K23 proposal seeks to provide an early-career clinical psychologist and neuroscientist (Dr. Alexander Weigard) with the mentorship, training, and resources necessary to launch a career as an independent patient- oriented investigator focused on using advanced computational methods to elucidate etiological mechanisms of substance use disorders (SUDs) and generate meaningful predictions for patients. The candidate will work towards this long-term goal through the completion of a research project focused on assessing whether two advanced computational methods can facilitate the selection of features from neuroscientific data that are relevant for the individualized prediction of SUD risk in youth. Although extant research in developmental neuroscience has identified multiple early risk factors that are associated with development of SUD at the group level, there is currently a dearth of large scale, replicable research in which neurocognitive data are used to make reliable and generalizable predictions of SUD outcomes for individual youth. In the proposed project, the candidate will combine his existing expertise in computational models of cognition with new training in predictive informatics methods to assess whether two advanced computational approaches, a) sequential sampling models (SSMs) of cognition and b) network neuroscience, can be used to extract features from longitudinal neurocognitive data that enhance the prediction of youths’ SUD outcomes. The candidate will conduct extensive analyses with two large data sets (Michigan Longitudinal Study, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study) and collect pilot data with 60 young adults to accomplish the following research aims: 1) Quantify the added benefit of SSM parameters for improving the performance of multivariate SUD prediction models, and 2) Identify the multivariate neural signature of v, an SSM parameter with promising links to substance use, and determine the potential of this signature for predicting a precursor to SUD (substance use initiation in mid-adolescence) in ABCD and differentiating young adults with SUDs in the newly-collected pilot sample. Completion of the following training objectives will ensure that the candidate can both carry out the proposed project and establish himself as an independent investigator who is well-equipped to conduct future projects following from this work: 1) Mastering principles of machine learning model development and testing in longitudinal data sets, 2) building expertise in using multivariate network neuroscience methods for feature selection and prediction, 3) increasing clinical and epidemiological knowledge of SUD risk factors beyond neurocognition, and 4) improving professional skills necessary to become an independent patient-oriented investigator. The proposed K23 aims to take a crucial step towards the development of advanced computational neuroscience methods that may ultimately inform SUD prevention efforts by identifying reliable predictors of individuals’ SUD risk, and to set the candidate up to independently conduct leading edge research in the interest of this larger goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Decades of developmental neuroscience research have illuminated multiple factors that convey risk for the development of substance use disorders (SUDs) at the group level, but the field currently lacks methods for using neurocognitive data to make accurate and generalizable predictions about SUD risk for individual youth. The proposed project seeks to address this critical gap in the field by providing an early-career scientist with the tools and training necessary to test whether the combination of two advanced computational approaches, sequential sampling models of cognitive functioning and network neuroscience methods, improve the accuracy of multivariate predictive models of individuals’ SUD risk. Knowledge from this project could lead to the development of novel computational approaches that optimize the identification of predictive features in youths’ neurocognitive data, which may ultimately inform SUD prevention efforts.",Leveraging computational models of neurocognition to improve predictions about individual youths' risk for substance use disorders,10213907,K23DA051561,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychologist', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'computational neuroscience', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'early onset substance use', 'emerging adulthood', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'longitudinal dataset', 'meetings', 'model development', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'young adult']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2021,196560
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness.

The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,10204721,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2021,411713
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,10197781,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,587831
"Predicting Outcomes in Children with Ulcerative Colitis Summary/Abstract Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic intestinal disorder, a type of inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD). UC causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding and weight loss. Each year there are about 38,000 new UC cases with about 25-30% being children. UC is often more severe in children than adults. There is no standard regimen for managing all people with UC. Treatment of UC includes 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics and surgery to remove the colon. Ideally a personalized medicine approach should be taken to tailor therapy to the individual patient based on their disease severity and predicted response. However, there is currently a lack of guidance to clinicians as to which children are going to do well with these medications and who needs more medication exposure or surgery. To address this important issue, a clinical trial of standardized medical therapy was launched enrolling 428 children newly diagnosed with UC at 29 pediatric medical centers in North America (Predicting Response to Standardized Pediatric Colitis Therapy: The PROTECT Study). The PROTECT study collected clinical, genetic, environment and immune factors along with biospecimens including blood, stool, and colonic tissue. It was anticipated that a combination of clinical, genetic, and immunologic tests performed at diagnosis can construct a valuable predictive model for personalized medicine which can be implemented to improve clinical outcomes such as early and late remission on 5-ASA only without the concurrent use of steroid medications. Along this line, state-of-art machine learning algorithms can ultimately utilize the PROTECT study data and more accurately predict clinical outcomes. The ability to develop accurate predictive models using basic clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and laboratory data would be extremely helpful to clinicians, as well as to patients/families in helping them better understand the decision making process. ML-based models will be validated with external electronic health records data. Further, there is a lack of easy- to-use clinical decision support tool to help clinicians make decisions in the ﬁeld. This study will ﬁll the gap. Project Narrative The proposed project will accurately predict early and late clinical outcomes of patients following initial standard therapy in children with ulcerative colitis.

"Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children ABSTRACT In many areas of the world, children are regularly exposed to environmental chemicals. During any given period of life, children will experience exposure to many chemicals at the same time. The effects of such mixtures of chemicals on the molecular underpinnings of the disease process, such as oxidative stress (OS) or on functional endpoints such as cognitive functions, are not well understood in children. There is also little understating of the extent to which endogenous antioxidant defenses in children's bodies or exogenous antioxidants buffer the effects of chemical mixtures on children's health. The few studies on this topic to date have been mostly cross-sectional or limited to small numbers of chemicals. To address these gaps, the proposed study will leverage the Salud Ambiental Montevideo (SAM) cohort in Uruguay, which has enrolled 679 1st-grade children between years 2012-19. Currently, children range in age 7-15 years and have been followed-up for 0-5 years, depending on year of enrollment. Exposure to chlorpyrifos and pyrethroids pesticides has been characterized in a sub-sample of children using urinary metabolites of the pesticides. Exposure to metals in this cohort is generally low. In a cross-sectional pilot study of SAM participants, a metal mixture was linked to higher levels of oxidative DNA damage and with lower performance on a test of general cognitive abilities. The proposed study will consist of 3 years of follow-up of SAM children to annually characterize the levels of metals in blood and urine, and metabolites of chlorpyrifos, pyrethroids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urine. Each year, urinary biomarkers of OS (F2-isoprostane and 8-OHdG), serum antioxidant enzymes (GPx and PON1), and serum antioxidant vitamins (vitamin C, carotenoids, retinol, etc). will be measured. A sub-sample of ~100 children will participate in a year-long intensive (monthly) assessment of OS biomarkers to characterize short-term fluctuations in biomarkers and their biological predictors. Children will complete assessments of executive functions (EF) in Y2 and Y3 of the study. Leveraging data collected at enrollment into SAM (T0, ~7y), chemical mixtures will be constructed in statistical machine learning models for four time points: T0 and Y1-3 of the proposed study. These mixtures will be modeled to understand how exposure to mixtures over time is associated with OS and EF. Potential effect modification by antioxidants will be tested. The proposed activities align with the 2018-23 NIEHS strategic plan of research on the exposome to promote human health through the advancement of environmental health sciences. Specifically, they will: 1) advance the basic understanding of short (1 yr) and medium-term (3 yrs) fluctuations in biomarkers of OS and antioxidant defenses, which have not been investigated in children; 2) contribute to understanding of the extent to which chemical mixtures in early-middle childhood affect a molecular process (OS) thought to underlie the development of chronic disease, as well as functional endpoints that underlie children's learning and social interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Throughout their lives, children are exposed to many different chemicals but our understanding of the effects of these mixtures on child health is limited. Our research is relevant to public health: it will inform prevention efforts and communication of risks by creating a deeper understanding of how exposure to chemical mixtures affects oxidative stress and cognition in children and how well the body's antioxidant defenses are able to counteract these effects. Our work is also relevant to the mission of the NIEHS: it will contribute fundamental knowledge on environmental influences on disease.",Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children,10265540,R01ES031411,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All-Trans-Retinol', 'Antioxidants', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Arylesterase', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Carotenoids', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serum', 'Social Interaction', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tocopherols', 'Urine', 'Uruguay', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'aged', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'aryldialkylphosphatase', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'early adolescence', 'environmental chemical', 'enzyme activity', 'executive function', 'experience', 'first grade', 'follow-up', 'glutathione peroxidase', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'middle childhood', 'oxidative DNA damage', 'pyrethroid', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'urinary']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2021,543551
"COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has manifested in children with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to devastating acute respiratory symptoms, appendicitis (often with rupture), and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a serious inflammatory condition presenting several weeks after exposure to or infection with the virus. These presentations overlap in their clinical severity while maintaining distinct clinical profiles. Public health and clinical approaches will benefit from an improved understanding of the spectrum of illness associated with SARS CoV-2 and from the capacity to integrate data to achieve two goals: (i) to identify the clinical, social, and biological variables that predict severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, and (ii) to target those populations and individuals at greatest risk for harm from the virus. We propose the COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) comprising eight partners providing access to data on >15 million children. Our network will systematically integrate social, epidemiological, genetic, immunological, and computational approaches to identify both population- and individual-level risk factors for severe illness. Our underlying hypothesis is that a combination of multidimensional data – clinical, sociodemographic, epidemiologic, and biological -- can be integrated to predict which children are at greatest risk to have severe consequences from SARS-CoV-2 infection. To test our hypothesis, we will develop CONNECT to Predict SIck Children, a network of networks that leverages inpatient, outpatient, community, and epidemiological data resources to support the analysis of large data using machine learning and model-based analyses. For the R61 phase, we will develop and refine predictive models using data from our network of networks (Aim 1). We will also recruit participants previously diagnosed with either COVID-19 or MIS-C (along with appropriate controls who have had mild or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV2), who will provide survey data (including social determinants) and saliva and blood samples to identify persisting biological factors associated with severe disease (Aim 2). We will iteratively assess our models using a knowledge management framework that considers the marginal value of data for improving models' predictive capacity over time. In the R33 phase, we will validate and further refine predictive models incorporating data from additional participants recruited throughout our network of networks, including newly infected children with severe COVID-19 or MIS-C identified through real-time surveillance (Aim 3). We seek to develop predictive models for children and adolescents that are useful, sensitive to community and environmental contexts, and informed by the REASSURED framework specified by the RFA. The models and biomarkers developed through our nationwide network of networks will produce generalizable knowledge that will improve our ability to predict which children are at greatest risk for severe complications of SARS-CoV- 2 infection. This knowledge will facilitate interventions to prevent and treat severe pediatric illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a world-wide public health problem. Pediatric disease has been particularly difficult to manage since children tend less frequently to get sick from SARS-CoV-2 infection as adults but, when they do become ill, can present with life-threatening pulmonary disease or a systemic inflammatory condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The proposed COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) will develop models and biomarkers that predict risk for severe disease in children and adolescents by systematically integrating social science, epidemiological, genetic, biochemical, immunological, and computational approaches.",COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children),10273971,R61HD105619,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Appendicitis', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Health Information System', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Resources Management', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Obesity', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RADx', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Social Sciences', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Health Resources and Services Administration', 'Virus', 'base', 'case control', 'case finding', 'coronavirus disease', 'data resource', 'developmental disease', 'epidemiologic data', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'saliva sample', 'severe COVID-19', 'social', 'social determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'translational approach']",NICHD,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R61,2021,840235
"A Multimodal Parent-focused Intervention for Vulnerable Populations in the Bronx PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In response to PAR-20-237, “community interventions to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among health disparity and vulnerable populations,” we propose to study a parent-focused mentalizing intervention with a smartphone health platform in vulnerable populations in the Bronx. The Bronx—the poorest borough in New York City (NYC) with 84% of its population comprised of minorities—has been hit disproportionally by the COVID-19 pandemic. For caregivers in the Bronx, the pandemic has caused unprecedented psychological distress; in addition to combating social determinants of health (SDOH), these families now face greater financial insecurity and challenges related to their school-aged children. Furthermore, social distancing requirements and limited telehealth resources for Bronx families have posed greater barriers to healthcare. Such parental distress contributes to heightened risk of transgenerational cycles of psychological stress, trauma and maltreatment. Addressing these challenges, we propose a multimodal study tackling both parental vulnerability and healthcare access. a) Targeting parental vulnerability, we propose to build upon our 12-session therapeutic CARE program, which utilizes Mentalization Based Therapy and designed for parents of children in treatment in a community psychiatry clinic in our health system. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of attachment-based parenting interventions, including from our group in disadvantaged cohorts from the Bronx. b) Targeting healthcare access, we propose to utilize the HIPAA-compliant and IRB-approved Valera Health smartphone application (“app”), which has been studied in our health system in selected cohorts and resulted in greater access to healthcare. Building upon our work and clinical infrastructure, we hypothesize that both the CARE program and the Valera app will mitigate the psychological effects of COVID-19 while enhancing access to healthcare in the Bronx. The study will take place at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), the largest health system in the Bronx, which serves predominantly racial and ethnic minority individuals from underserved families. We will focus on three highly vulnerable cohorts: a) caregivers of children with psychiatric conditions (N=130); b) caregivers of children with autoimmune illnesses (N=130), and; c) caregivers who are frontline healthcare workers at MMC (N=100); all presenting with moderate stress. A RCT with 4 arms (2 x 2 design) will test our hypothesis: a) CARE program alone; b) CARE program + Valera app; c) Parent Education (PE) alone; d) PE + Valera app. Smartphones and connectivity will be provided as needed. Surveys at study enrollment, 6-, 12- and 24-weeks will assess parental stress, mentalizing capacity (reflective functioning), access to healthcare, mood and anxiety and additional parent and child clinical measures. Machine learning approaches will explore complex patterns as predictors of outcome including COVID-19 illness/deaths, medical comorbidity, housing, poverty, psychopathology, age, family functioning, and trauma. Impact. This multimodal study addresses key strategies to mitigate the psychological and health impact of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Our proposed prospective research, focusing on examining the effectiveness of both a telehealth platform and an innovative treatment approach for parents and primary caregivers as well as frontline healthcare providers who are currently experiencing unprecedented levels of perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to provide support to these highly vulnerable groups based in the Bronx who normally encounter significant barriers to basic care. If successful, the study has the potential to offset several of the negative social determinants of health typically encountered by members of these vulnerable communities. As such, the clinical implications of our proposed research are potentially profound.",A Multimodal Parent-focused Intervention for Vulnerable Populations in the Bronx,10261854,R01MH126821,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Autoimmune Process', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Psychiatry', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disadvantaged', 'Distress', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cohort', 'community intervention', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy evaluation', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'maltreatment', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'outcome prediction', 'pandemic disease', 'perceived stress', 'primary caregiver', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'racial minority', 'relative effectiveness', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'social health determinants', 'substance use treatment', 'telehealth', 'therapy design']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,50000
"Diversity Supplement to Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark’s population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD and mortality later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis- generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation.

"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",10158509,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,2152577
"Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic value for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In adults, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. Severe infection can also occur both in children and young adults (< 21), and a significant proportion of children admitted with Covid-19 require ICU support, frequently including mechanical ventilation. In addition, children and adolescents with initially asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have presented with a rare, but very severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory predictors of progression towards severe forms of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C are thus urgently needed in the fight against Covid-19 in this population. As defined in the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program, biomarker discovery can enable risk stratification and guide interventional studies to target Covid-19 patients at enhanced risk of developing complications and/or severe disease. To target this discovery initiative, herein we will use a battery of biological, immunological and molecular tests, including Grating-Coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) and advanced flow cytometry, to study children and young adults (<21 years) with mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. GCFP allows the use of disposable biosensor chips that can be mass-produced at low cost and spotted in microarray format to greatly increase multiplexing capabilities. In addition, we will use a similar biomarker approach for rapid differentiation of patients with MIS-C versus other pediatric infectious or inflammatory conditions where the clinical presentation resembles MIS-C, most importantly Kawasaki disease. A child’s biologic and immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure is likely influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, epigenetics and products of the mucosa/gut-brain axis, adipose tissue and neuroendocrine immune network, and further modulated by environmental exposures. With these factors in mind, we hypothesize that a child’s biomarker profile in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables a timely and accurate prediction of severity of Covid-19 and diagnosis of MIS-C, and will help guide treatment strategies, and predict patient outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will use a non-traditional diagnostic and comprehensive biomarker discovery to characterize the clinical and laboratory spectrum of children and adolescents with mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as MIS-C.

"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10122993,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579032
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,10169180,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diagnostic platform', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2021,344735
"Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess Parent-Infant Interactions as a Mechanism Linking COVID-related Stress and Infant Neurobehavioral Functioning The young child’s ability to regulate stress sets the foundation for a host of developmental outcomes, and the parent-infant relationship is the primary context in which stress regulation capacities first develop. Prior research underscores how parents’ own stress may lead to disturbances in parent-infant co-regulation of stress. Given the immense disruptions to family life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to understand the degree to which COVID-related stress may impact the parent-infant relationship and ultimately infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes. We posit here that (a) maternal stress due to the pandemic will be associated with disturbances in the mother-infant relationship, particularly with respect to mother-infant co- regulation of infant distress and (b) mothers’ experiences of COVID-related stress will have an indirect effect on infant neurobehavioral outcomes, in part, due to disturbances to the mother-infant relationship. We also aim to investigate risk factors (e.g., maternal depressive symptoms, substance use; infant negative emotionality) that might exacerbate such linkages, as well as protective factors (e.g., maternal social support, coping) that may attenuate them. We will partner with six sites from the NIH HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study- Phase 1 (New York University, Oregon Health Sciences University, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute) that will permit addressing the proposed aims among a geographically diverse sample of 240 families with infants between 6 and 18 months of age. To assess key constructs relevant to mother-infant relationship disturbance, we will use a novel multimodal sensing platform that captures infant vocalizations, stress physiology, and motor behavior, and we will employ machine learn approaches to these multimodal data to yield automated assessments of mother-infant co-regulation of infant distress. By combining assessments of (a) mothers’ COVID-related experiences, as well as maternal, family, and infant functioning, collected by the six HBCD sites via maternal reports and virtual visits and (b) mother-infant co-regulation of stress in home environments using remote multimodal sensing technology, the current study will provide unique opportunities for a nuanced and rich understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on infants born during this unprecedented time. Downstream effects of COVID-19 on infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes are likely to be transmitted, in part, through disruptions in the parent-infant relationship due to parents’ heightened stress and poorer mental health. This project will investigate such downstream effects using novel technology and machine learning methods that permit remote assessment of infants and parents in the home. Results from this project may aid in the development of “just-in-time” interventions for parents and infants at risk for relationships disturbance.",Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess Parent-Infant Interactions as a Mechanism Linking COVID-related Stress and Infant Neurobehavioral Functioning,10239919,R34DA050256,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Arkansas', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Church', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Services', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Home Economics', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Job loss', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Mind', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'New York', 'North Carolina', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'caregiving', 'coping', 'coronavirus disease', 'depressive symptoms', 'economic impact', 'experience', 'falls', 'infancy', 'infection rate', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'maternal stress', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'patient home care', 'phase 1 study', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'remote sensing', 'resilience', 'sensor technology', 'social culture', 'stressor', 'virtual', 'virtual visit', 'vocalization']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R34,2021,234822
"Place-level discrimination and birth outcomes Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability.  In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination  partially contributes to this disparity. Most of research on discrimination and birth outcomes  relies on self-reported experiences of discrimination, and there have been few studies examining  discrimination at the U.S. national level. Social contexts in which greater hostility towards  minorities is manifested may cause psychological stress and increase risk of adverse birth  outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to develop a new county-level indicator  of discriminatory attitudes from social media data as well as make use hate crimes data and  measures of explicit and implicit racial bias to provide a detailed and nuanced investigation of  the impact of discrimination on birth outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes.  Another strength of this research plan is the longitudinal study design with multiple years of data  for both measures of discrimination and birth outcomes, which allows us to control for temporal  trends and stable characteristics of the counties. Furthermore, the influence of discrimination on  birth outcomes may begin prior to pregnancy. There is increasing recognition of maternal health  prior to conception influencing fetal development and birth outcomes. The project will empirically  evaluate whether place-level discrimination is associated with biomarkers of chronic stress among  young women of child-bearing age. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds  on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in: 1)  developing expertise in Big Data, 2) measurement of discrimination, and 3) stress physiology and  birth outcomes. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful  independent research career evaluating how discrimination impact minority health and health  disparities. Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability.  In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination  partially contributes to this disparity.

"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9981015,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'home test', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2021,118352
"Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The prevalence of psychiatric disorders has reached nearly epidemic proportions. Rates of common affective diseases (unipolar depression, anxiety and stress disorders) are high across the lifespan and these diseases place a tremendous social and economic burden on the individual and society. Clear evidence indicates that most affective disorders emerge at the intersection of pre-existing vulnerability and significant, highly stressful, life-events. However, current models of emotion-related risk do not adequately account for this confluence of biological, historical, and situational factors. In this investigation, we build upon our prior work demonstrating broad associations between flexible emotion processing and psychological health and adjustment, and in-flexible emotion and psychological risk and affective disease. Specifically, we will recruit 400 adults in hospital following a potentially traumatic event (e.g., accident, violence, fire, etc.) in order to model the influence of early emotion processing on trajectories of adjustment. We focus our investigation on the super-ordinate construct of Emotion flexibility (EF) which encompasses the ability to generate or up-regulate emotions, as well as to shift or down-regulate emotions according to needs and/or environmental demands. EF is well-suited to inform models of emotion-related risk and adjustment as it characterizes an optimal balance of two biologically-based, constituent dimensions: “bottom-up” threat-related processing and “top-down” cognitive control increasingly recognized as central to all emotion processing. We propose rigorous methods to assess EF and related processing in-vivo in lab and via experience sampling. Moreover, we will follow participants to 18 months post event so as to effectively model the association between emotion processing and trajectories of adjustment, while also considering established influences such as physical health status, psychiatric history, childhood maltreatment, daily stress/hassles, and social support. In particular, we will incorporate recent developments in advanced statistical modelling to better characterize the complex and interactive influence of historical and contemporary factors on moment-level emotion processing, EF and adjustment. Broadly, this project is in line with the most recent NIMH strategic plan and will contribute to more complex models of the most common affective diseases, including facilitating the charting of illness trajectories to help determine when, where, and how to intervene. Moreover, this research will directly examine how variation in key systems can influence emotion-processing and adjustment to aversive life events, fitting complex influences more directly into models of risk for the most common and burdensome affective diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/NARRATIVE Emotion-related psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, affect a considerable portion of adults in this country and rank as many of the most burdensome diseases worldwide. In this investigation, we will follow an at-risk sample of adults in order to better understand how one key pathway, relating to how individuals process emotion, influences risk for emotion-related diseases over time. In addition, we test the role by which certain other factors, both contemporary and historical (physical health, life stress, social support, psychiatric treatment history, or childhood experiences) may increase or decrease risk via this particular pathway.",Unpacking Emotion Inflexibility and Prospective Prediction of Affective Disease,10089147,R01MH113622,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotions', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Longevity', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Work', 'base', 'childhood adversity', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'laboratory experience', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'negative mood', 'network models', 'physical conditioning', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,664089
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and

"Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children PROJECT SUMMARY The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and resultant pandemic of COVID-19 disease has overwhelmed global health systems and led to over 200,000 American deaths to date. While initial reports suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection in children was generally benign, a novel post-inflammatory syndrome known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has now been described. MIS-C in children is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, and end-organ involvement, and the majority of patients are IgG seropositive for SARS- CoV-2. Because the clinical features of MIS-C overlap with other infections and inflammatory disorders, new strategies for diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children are urgently needed. Our immediate objective (during the R61 phase) is to determine the reproducible changes in breath, urine, and salivary volatile composition in chil- dren diagnosed with MIS-C. We will integrate these discovery studies with clinical and immunological profiling to develop (during R61 phase) and validate (during R33 phase) a novel and much-needed MIS-C diagnostic, which is expected to have a major impact on care of febrile children. Our long-term goal to develop a diagnostic strategy to distinguish children with MIS-C from children with other causes of fever. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate our expertise and feasibility of this strategy, our objectives will be met through three specific aims: 1) Characterize breath biomarkers in children with MIS-C (R61); 2) Relate breath VOC changes to virolog- ical, disease severity, and immunological features of MIS-C (R61); and 3) Validate our novel MIS-C diagnostic for clinical use (R33). The proposed research is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed MIS-C rapid diagnostic tool. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because there is no current validated diagnostic tool for the post-SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory disorder in children, MIS-C. Our proposal will develop a new strategy to diagnose this disorder, which will directly improve care of children with fever and help support future clinical studies.",Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children,10272856,R61HD105594,"['2019-nCoV', 'Academy', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'American', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Canis familiaris', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Virology', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical epidemiology', 'coronavirus disease', 'global health', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'seropositive', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'translational study', 'validation studies', 'virology', 'volatile organic compound']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R61,2021,879259
"Improving precision in modeling childhood executive function trajectories using psychometrics Project Summary: Executive functions are high-level supervisory cognitive skills vital for a child’s social and academic success. Their core components include working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. The development of executive functions in children can be adversely affected by many early life risk factors, such as lead exposure and low socioeconomic status. However, there are two difficulties to precisely measuring and modeling executive functions, which hamper our understanding of how risk factors can predict shifts in executive functioning: 1) It is common to use a single child performance task to tap into an executive function component. While this can yield important information, it can also lead to bias, because executive functions can be difficult to measure precisely, since they are interdependent and also rely on non-executive function skills. 2) It can be challenging to model the longitudinal development of executive functions because the set of tasks used to assess executive functions can change as a child grows. Some tasks may be specific to a particular age range and not appropriate for other ages. To address the first difficulty, we will improve the precision of measuring an executive function component by using well-established latent variable approaches which integrate output from multiple tasks. Preliminary analyses demonstrate that this approach can yield improved interpretability of a risk factor’s impact on an executive function component, compared to separate analyses of each task. To address the second difficulty, we propose to use advanced psychometric and item response theory methods to create a longitudinal scale of executive functioning with optimized precision and construct validity that span all the ages of interest. This will allow us to identify how risk factors can predict changes in executive function over time (e.g. developmental trajectory). This proposal leverages data from two large, NIH-funded prospective birth cohorts with extensive longitudinal data and repeated assessments of many executive function tasks, and detailed measures of risk factors (e.g. lead exposure, low socioeconomic status). Open-source, user-friendly software for the developed approaches will be developed, including a web application for non-statistical users. I (Dr. Shelley Liu) am a biostatistician and an Assistant Professor in Population Health Science and Policy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). ISMMS provides an excellent environment for this K25; all mentors and advisory committee members are based at ISMMS. My training will involve 1) formal graduate level coursework on executive function development, child neuropsychology, item response theory and psychometric scaling; 2) tutorials in neurodevelopment and psychometrics with my mentoring team; and 3) clinical rotations to observe neurobehavioral assessments. This training will complement my existing expertise in biostatistics. I aim to become an independent, R01-funded researcher studying child neurodevelopment and associated risk factors. Project narrative Ensuring healthy neurodevelopment for children can lead to tremendous societal gain. We propose a modeling framework that can improve our understanding of how early life factors impact neurodevelopment, which could inform targeted prevention and intervention strategies.",Improving precision in modeling childhood executive function trajectories using psychometrics,10191889,K25HD104918,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Committee Members', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor V', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York City', 'Output', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Science Policy', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive skill', 'cohort', 'environmental stressor', 'executive function', 'fetal lead exposure', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'lead exposure', 'low socioeconomic status', 'maternal stress', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'nutrition', 'open source', 'population health', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social stressor', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'web app']",NICHD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K25,2021,130561
"The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD Project Summary To reduce the increasing societal and financial burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), prevention is critical. Even small improvements of the modifiable dementia risk factors on the individual level have the potential to lead to a substantial reduction of dementia cases at the population level. The disease processes occur for years though symptoms typically appear after age 60. Thus, identifying those at risk early for intervention is crucial. Studies among adults aged 60 years and older have identified performance-based measures of impairment in physical function as early indicators of ADRD, three or more years prior to onset. To improve earlier prediction of ADRD, we need research on adults aged 51-59 years to assess the relationship between physical functional impairment and likelihood of ADRD onset years later. Further, given the burden of administering performance-based measures of physical function, it would be advantageous to use patient- reported metrics of limitation in physical function for ADRD prediction. We propose using the 1998-2018 nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of adults aged 51-59 years to determine the extent to which patient-reported measures of function would facilitate efficient ADRD risk identification. Primary study aims are to: 1) To identify the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function in midlife predict future late-onset ADRD. We will use standardized (RAND HRS) self-reported measures of function and the Langa-Weir ADRD algorithm available in the HRS. Working hypothesis: Limitations in physical function, defined using summary measures of self-reported physical function predict onset of ADRD 4 to 20 years later. 2) Verify that sub-groups of adults, defined by limitations in physical function, aged 51-59 are at higher risk of developing ADRD. We will verify existence of sub-groups (identified in our preliminary analyses) using a computational systems approach (cluster analysis) are predictive of onset of ADRD through 2018, in adjusted analyses. Working hypothesis: Sub-groups of middle-aged adults with unique patterns of limitations in physical function are at higher risk of developing ADRD than those without physical functional deficit 4 to 20 years later, independent of related factors. This proposal addresses the objectives of PAS-19-391 in several ways. First, the Principal investigator (PI), an early stage investigator, is committed to a career in ADRD research. Second, the investigative team has training in non-neurological medical fields and will shift their research focus to ADRD prevention within their fields. Third, the PI has experience with an existing dataset (HRS); and will use it to assess age-related changes in non-cognitive processes that may be early signs of ADRD. Finally, the PI published an HRS study reporting that physical functional decline precedes the onset of diabetes, a risk factor for ADRD. Our proposal builds on this work. The successful completion of the proposed study will ascertain the extent to which self-reported impairment in physical function during midlife, predicts future ADRD, thereby offering a new, efficient mechanism for early identification of ADRD. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple worldwide by 2050 unless effective measures to treat or delay the onset of the disease are implemented.1 The same study found that about 35% of ADRD could be delayed or prevented through modifiable health and lifestyle factors from different phases of life. To identify adults at risk of ADRD early, our study among adults aged 51-59 seeks to determine the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function are early indicators of ADRD and to identify sub-groups of people with unique patterns of limitation in physical function that are early indicators of ADRD.",The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD,10106121,R03AG070668,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Blood', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Financial Hardship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Activity', 'Muscle', 'Nursing Homes', 'Observational Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive measure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Subjects Selections', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'dementia risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'grasp', 'high risk', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'performance based measurement', 'prevent']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,287889
"A Learning Health System Approach to Precision Sedation and Analgesia in Critically-Ill Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Approximately 500,000 children suffer critical illness every year in the United States and more than one third will receive a continuous infusion of a sedative-analgesic medication such as an opioid or dexmedetomidine. Such drugs are commonly administered to ease the burden of critical illness by treating serious pain and anxiety associated with invasive organ support delivery and procedures in the intensive care unit. However, there are no widely-accepted standards for the administration of these potent neuroactive medications and several studies have demonstrated that children receive too little or too much of these medications nearly half of the time they are administered. This imprecision in conventional dosing strategies leads to adverse events, including acute physiologic deterioration, drug tolerance and dependency, prolonged illness and hospitalization and life-threatening complications of invasive support such as unplanned extubation and post-extubation airway obstruction. Evidence also indicates that relatively short exposures to these medications may be detrimental to long-term neurodevelopment. More precise strategies for administering these medications to children are needed and this is an issue of major  PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinicians caring for critically ill children routinely struggle to harmonize the tension between giving too much versus too little sedation-analgesia. This work will (1) identify patterns of sedation-analgesia associated with outcome; (2) identify genotypes associated with sedation-analgesia administration; (3) characterize PK parameters of common sedative-analgesic mediations; and (4) promote the development of the PI as an independent Learning Health System researcher. The aggregate results of this work will inform development of a predictive model for sedation-analgesia dose response for critically ill children that will be the focus of future, prospective investigations",A Learning Health System Approach to Precision Sedation and Analgesia in Critically-Ill Children,10134393,K23HD099331,"['Absence of pain sensation', 'Acute', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Analgesics', 'Anxiety', 'Blood specimen', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Continuous Infusion', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Dependence', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fentanyl', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Opioid', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'biobank', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genotyped patients', 'healing', 'health related quality of life', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'inter-individual variation', 'mathematical model', 'medication administration', 'neurodevelopment', 'patient response', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'routine care', 'sedative', 'self-directed learning', 'treatment as usual', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2021,161755
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center Project Summary/Abstract In its initial funding period, the ABCD consortium used a rigorous epidemiological approach to recruit a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10-year-olds through our 21 research sites, of which 2136 are twins or triplets. ABCD has created a comprehensive yet efficient protocol for participating youth and parents, using standardized and state-of-the-art methods for neuroimaging, biospecimens, and assessments of substance use, mental and physical health, neurocognition, culture, and environment, using a fully digital platform and making use of mobile technologies. We ensure cohesion and standardization by having employed a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC), which will: maintain and update the harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; perform rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay- derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state-of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; continue development of infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows; and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,878 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC) will maintain and update harmonized MRI protocols across sites and scanners, perform quality control of raw and derived data, and implement the informatics and computational infrastructure needed for the overall project.","ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center",10144963,U24DA041123,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caffeine', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Update', 'Youth', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'data archive', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'data quality', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high standard', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'infrastructure development', 'mobile computing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'success', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'web portal']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,1020000
"Diagnosing and predicting risk in children with SARS-CoV-2- related illness In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has evolved as a new threat to children exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The emergence of MIS-C is so new and so rapidly evolving that there are currently no diagnostic tests to identify these patients nor are there tools to predict disease progression. Through established, funded, multi-center consortia in the U.S. (CHARMS: Characterization of MIS-C and its Relationship to Kawasaki Disease funded by PCORI) and the UK (DIAMONDS), we will collect clinical data and samples to support the proposed studies. First, we will generate transcript, protein and antibody datasets from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, and with other febrile illnesses. Next, we will use these data to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostic tests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing our established collaboration with Columbia University, we will define the antibody repertoire against all known human coronaviruses and determine how pre-existing antibody to other coronaviruses may shape the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C. The first two years (R61) will build on the expertise of the assembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2- infected patients and relate clinical parameters to the antibody response to coronaviral antigens profiled on peptide arrays. This work will leverage already banked plasma, serum, and RNA samples from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Rigorous Go/NoGo criteria have been established and will determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) will focus on platform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection, point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular data will be deposited in the RADx-rad hub to facilitate data sharing. Many potential hurdles in this type of research have already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinical samples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data has been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics, and coronaviral antibody responses, and d) the teams have a strong track record of previous collaboration and productivity. The synergistic expertise of these investigative teams in this multi-center proposal provides a unique opportunity to create diagnostic and prognostic tools for children suffering from the spectrum of SARS- CoV-2 illnesses. 1 Project Narrative As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved in early 2020, case reports appeared describing children with unusual febrile illnesses with elevated inflammatory markers and multi-system involvement that is now termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). The illness occurs weeks following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and these children have a wide spectrum of disease severity ranging from cardiogenic shock to milder illness that can be self-limited. To address an urgent, unmet clinical need, investigative teams across three countries will join forces to discover and validate a diagnostic test to identify children with MIS-C and predict progression of disease.",Diagnosing and predicting risk in children with SARS-CoV-2- related illness,10271147,R61HD105590,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody-Dependent Enhancement', 'Antigens', 'Aptamer Technology', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Burn injury', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'California', 'Cardiogenic Shock', 'Case Study', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Fever', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Industrialization', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'London', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Molecular', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RADx Radical', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 antibody', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'human coronavirus', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning method', 'pediatrician', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'severe COVID-19', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'testing services', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'two-dimensional', 'vaccine development']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R61,2021,698415
"Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease Project Summary Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States with high morbidity and mortality. They are estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life-years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year. Significant disparities are known to exist in short-term outcomes and resource utilization. We have shown that children from low income neighborhoods have 18% higher risk-adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, have 7% longer lengths-of-stay, and require 7% more perioperative resources than do children from higher income neighborhoods, even after controlling for the effects of race, public versus private insurance provider, and the hospitals at which these children ultimately receive surgical repair. Research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and mechanisms driving health inequities remain unknown. Greater than 50% of children with congenital heart disease are covered by Medicaid. We have partnered with the NY Department of Health and have clean, validated data for all Medicaid patient encounters over 15 years across NY State. We have developed methods of abstracting and linking locally-held clinical registry data to Medicaid files and have built an interdisciplinary team of pediatric cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, health services researchers, health economists, and NY Department of Health senior leadership to identify dimensions of healthcare access that could be targeted through center- or state-level interventions to reduce inequities. We propose linking pediatric cardiac surgical clinical registry data from across NY State, longitudinal Medicaid claims, Census Bureau data, geocoded data, and the National Death Index. We will use these data to accomplish the following Aims: 1) We will define 10-year risk-stratified, multi-dimensional outcomes (mortality and morbidities) and associated health expenditures for children undergoing congenital heart surgery across New York State; 2) we will develop novel longitudinal risk models for children with congenital heart disease that adjust for social determinants of health, and 3) we will test dimensions of healthcare access as modifiable drivers of health inequities among children in New York with congenital heart disease on Medicaid. Achieving our aims would 1) establish a comprehensive, population-based resource for longitudinal outcomes and health expenditure research, inclusive of not only in-patient data, but also out-patient, emergency room, pharmacy, rehabilitation, home healthcare, education records, and neighborhood-level social determinants of health for nearly half of all children undergoing congenital heart surgery in NY State, 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value applicable across multiple populations, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) position us to translate these findings into policy and care changes to reduce health inequities. Project Narrative Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States, estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life- years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year, with significantly worse outcomes for children from lower income neighborhoods and minorities. Despite the high prevalence, research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and etiologies of health inequities remain unknown. Linking clinical registries with longitudinal state-wide Medicaid data will 1) build a scalable resource that will allow us to assess longitudinal outcomes and resource requirements at a population level 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) immediately inform policy and care.",Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease,10079025,R01HL150044,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Ratios', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Child Mortality', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Congresses', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Expenditure', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'abstracting', 'acute care', 'care costs', 'college', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'data registry', 'disorder subtype', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health care service', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neonatal surgery', 'novel', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'population based', 'repaired', 'risk stratification', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'years of life lost']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,388654
"RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The research project outlined in this SBIR submission will develop the Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE) platform into a tool to promote sustained recovery in individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorder. In this proposal, the investigators intend to deploy the RAE system- consisting of a wearable sensor, a smartphone app, and a clinical portal- to provide individuals in recovery and their treatment providers with an opportunity to identify moments of high risk for relapse and to access real time intervention opportunities. Wearable biosensors are small, noninvasive devices that continuously record physiology. These sensors have the ability to detect digital biomarkers of drug use and stress, the latter of which herald an increased risk of relapse. RAE aims to utilize this capability to create a real-time solution for individuals in recovery. The components of RAE are: 1) The Empatica Embrace, a wrist mounted sensor similar in form factor to a smart watch, that continuously monitors skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA) and locomotion. Detection algorithms for stress and drug use will be embedded on the Embrace firmware. 2) The RAE smartphone application (app), for the individual in recovery. The app will be triggered either by detection of an event on the Embrace or manually by the user when needed and will provide multiple options for annotations, stress reduction techniques and immediate contact with individuals in the pre-defined support system via call or SMS text. The app will also log sleep, physical activity, and geographic location of events. 3) The RAE Portal, for the treatment provider, will deliver immediate alerts when an event is detected on the user’s device for the opportunity to intervene in real time and will also provide metrics on the user’s recorded activities. The research plan has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To deploy and optimize the RAE system in a population of individuals in treatment for substance use disorder and Aim 2) To demonstrate the impact of the RAE system on outcomes in substance use treatment. To achieve these aims the investigators will first deploy the technology in a population of individuals in recovery and collect data on accuracy, usability and functionality (Aim 1). The data from Aim 1 will be used to optimize the system and achieve millstones prior to transition to Aim 2 which will include sensitivity, specify, accuracy and user compliance targets. The investigators will then undertake a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of RAE on key outcomes including rates of relapse, retention in treatment programs, and psychosocial wellbeing. The investigators have assembled a leadership team and advisory team with the necessary expertise in business, medicine, wearable technology and engineering to develop RAE into a tool that dramatically improves the success of treatment for substance use disorder, promotes sustained sobriety, and reduces morbidity and mortality from relapse to substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to substance use disorder has reached staggering proportions, and treatment options suffer from high rates of relapse. RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage) is a mobile based solution that combines a wearable sensor, a smartphone app and a cloud based clinical portal to detect stress and drug use in individuals in treatment for substance use disorder. The goal of the RAE system is to provide real-time intervention tools for patients, to allow clinicians to personalize the treatment approach for each patient, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use disorder by improving the success of treatment programs.","RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders",10356481,R44DA046151,"['Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Markers', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'Journals', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'User Compliance', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'active method', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'randomized controlled study', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'sobriety', 'software development', 'stress management', 'stress reduction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance use treatment', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,"CONTINUEYOU, LLC",R44,2021,739128
"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,10164858,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism community', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital healthcare', 'experience', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'remote monitoring', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,649383
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children PROJECT SUMMARY Children who are admitted to the hospital and experience deterioration have a high risk of mortality and poor long-term health. Current warning early scores indicating risk of deterioration are subjectively derived and have not reduced in-hospital mortality. In recent work, I developed a vital sign based statistical model that demonstrated improved accuracy over current risk scores at predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children 24 hours in advance. Within adults, the combination of longitudinal data analysis techniques, machine learning, and electronic health record (EHR) data have led to highly accurate early warning scores. Therefore, my aim in this grant proposal is to utilize longitudinal integration of EHR data in a machine learning framework to develop a model for predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children as early as possible. I will do this by first deriving and validating a prediction model using structured EHR data collected from three pediatric hospitals (Aim 1). Using the same cohort, I will then build and validate a prediction model using features derived from unstructured clinical notes (Aim 2). I will also compare if the addition of unstructured features improves the prediction accuracy of the model derived in Aim 1. Finally, I will determine the association between non-patient level environmental variables within the hospital ecosystem and risk of clinical deterioration in hospitalized children (Aim 3). I will also determine if the addition of these environmental risk factors improves performance of the prediction model derived through Aims 1 and 2. Completion of this proposal will result in a validated pediatric risk prediction model that will enable clinicians to recognize early signs of deterioration in hospitalized children. This will facilitate timely intervention, thereby saving lives and improving long-term health. In addition, this grant will also provide me with crucial data for a future R01 trial aimed at assessing the impact of the prediction model in reducing mortality, decreasing costs, and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children. To establish myself as an independent investigator in pediatric prediction modeling, I propose a training plan that includes comprehensive didactics and mentorship in the areas of longitudinal data analysis, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and concepts in pediatric care. I have assembled a first-class mentorship team comprised of national experts in longitudinal data analysis techniques and EHR-based machine learning (Robert Gibbons PhD and Matthew Churpek MD, PhD). My advisory team is comprised of experts in natural language processing (Dmitriy Dligach PhD), clinical decision support around deterioration events (Dana Edelson MD, MS and Priti Jani MD), and pediatric early warning scores (Christopher Parshuram MB., ChB., D. Phil., FRACP). By completing my research and career development goals, I will develop into an independent expert investigator in developing pediatric prediction models for ultimately improving outcomes in hospitalized children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical deterioration in hospitalized children is associated with high-risk of mortality as well as complications in their long-term health. An improved prediction model capable of identifying pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration as early as possible can facility timely and proper intervention, thereby decreasing preventable death and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children,10171893,K01HL148390,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Intervention', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalized Child', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'pediatric patients', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'research and development', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'tool', 'trend', 'unstructured data', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2021,147563
"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Predicting Substance Use among Military Veterans with a Positive MST Screen: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Military sexual trauma (MST) is a serious and pervasive problem among military populations, affecting approximately 16% of military personnel and veterans [1]. Substance use disproportionately affects individuals with a history of MST. Individuals with (vs. without) a history of MST are twice as likely to misuse substances [2-4]. Substance use among military samples has been linked to higher rates of negative consequences across several domains (e.g., health, occupational, legal [5, 6]), including death (e.g., overdose [7], traffic accidents [8], suicide [7, 8]). Further, while understudied among individuals with a history of MST in particular, negative substance use outcomes have been shown to be more severe among trauma-exposed populations, including more severe clinical presentations and poorer treatment prognosis [9, 10]. These findings emphasize the importance of clarifying the association between MST and substance use among military populations. Despite the clinical relevance and public health significance of substance use among military populations, research in this area has relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional designs. Moreover, the vast majority of studies in this area have utilized traditional statistical methods, which are limited in scope and capabilities. These limitations have important clinical implications, as they restrict our ability to specify the exact nature and directionality of the relationship between MST and substance use, thereby affecting how findings are translated into prevention and intervention efforts. The proposed research aims to fill these critical gaps by utilizing the Army STARRS pre/post-deployment study, a large, prospective military dataset to: (1) explicate the directional relation between MST and substance use using a longitudinal dataset, and (2) employ machine learning methods to develop an algorithm to optimize detection of substance use in military personnel with a history of MST. These findings will assist in elucidating the etiology of substance use among this high-risk group, as well as provide a prediction model for clinical use to better target at-risk individuals in this population. This research project will take place within the Department of Psychology at the University of Rhode Island; an institution with a strong history and commitment to health behavior research and methodology. The applicant will have access to sponsors and consultants with expertise in MST, substance use, advanced methodology, and statistical analysis that will facilitate her career objectives to develop increased knowledge and proficiency in (a) sexual trauma (e.g., MST) and substance use in military veterans; (b) grant/manuscript development; (c) statistical and methodological capabilities (i.e., machine learning); and (d) big data. The proposed project uses a timely and innovative approach to advance science on the relation between MST and substance use in military personnel. Addressing substance use in this population is necessary to improve the health of our nation's veterans, and aligns with the mission of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Project Narrative Military sexual trauma (MST) is highly prevalent among military personnel and is associated with disproportionate rates of substance use. By explicating the directional relation between MST and substance use, and utilizing machine learning to develop high-quality prediction models for clinical use, the proposed study will inform prevention and intervention efforts for this high-risk group. Findings will be used to improve clinical outcomes among military personnel with exposure to MST, and reduce the onset and maintenance of problematic substance use and associated negative consequences.",Predicting Substance Use among Military Veterans with a Positive MST Screen: A Machine Learning Approach,10140573,F31DA051167,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Military Personnel', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nature', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Overdose', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Medication', 'Service provision', 'Sexual Harassment', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Traffic accidents', 'Translating', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'military service', 'military veteran', 'outcome forecast', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'sexual assault', 'sexual trauma', 'skills', 'social', 'stem', 'substance misuse', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'trauma exposure']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND,F31,2021,41003
"Develop an Artificial Intelligence-powered Smartphone App AICaries for Caries Detection in Children Project Summary Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most common chronic childhood disease, with nearly 1.8 billion new cases per year globally. ECC afflicts approximately 55% of low-income and minority US preschool children, resulting in harmful short- and long-term effects on health and quality of life. The current biomedical approach to control the ECC pandemic has had limited success. It primarily focuses on restorative procedures rather than population-wide preventive strategies. Clinical evidence shows that caries is reversible if detected and addressed in its early stages. However, many low-income US children often have poor access to pediatric dental services. In this underserved group, dental caries is often diagnosed at a late stage when extensive restorative treatment is needed. We believe that with more than 85% of lower-income Americans owning a smartphone, mHealth tools hold great promise to achieve patient-driven early detection and risk control of ECC. Our long-term goal is to develop strategies that use mHealth tools to achieve early detection and prevention of ECC at a broad population base. Our previous innovative work has led to a novel prototype of an artificial intelligence (AI) -powered smartphone app, AICaries, to be used by children's parents/caregivers. This AICaries app prototype offers a) AI-powered caries detection using photos of children's teeth taken by the parents' smartphones, b) interactive caries risk assessment, and c) personalized education on reducing children's ECC risk. The preliminary AI- powered caries detection module demonstrated a satisfactory sensitivity and specificity for front teeth caries detection, using 6,895 annotated tooth images from 1,277 photos. We have recently built an archive of > 100,000 high-quality intra-oral photos that is ready to be used for finalizing the development of a reliable automatic detection algorithm. The immediate objectives of the study are - AIM 1: complete the development of AICaries smartphone app, maximize its caries detection performance, and achieve a caries detection sensitivity and specificity that are comparable to trained dental practitioners; AIM 2: employ a community-based participatory research strategy to conduct moderated testing and refinement of the app usability, and non-moderated field testing of the app feasibility/acceptability. Our multidisciplinary team is well-positioned for proposal success with needed expertise in computer science, AI imaging recognition, oral health care, mHealth, disparity research, patient education and community engagement. The AICaries app could facilitate early detection of ECC for many underserved US children, who often have poor access to pediatric dental services. Using AICaries, parents can use their regular smartphones to take photo of their children’s teeth and detect ECC aided by AICaries, so that they can actively seek treatment for their children at an early and reversible stage of ECC. Using AICaries, parents can also obtain essential knowledge on reducing their children's caries risk. Data from this R21 will support a R01 clinical trial that evaluates the real-world impact of using this innovative smartphone app on early detection and prevention of ECC among low-income children. Narrative Although largely preventable, early childhood caries (ECC) remains the most common chronic childhood disease, disproportionately afflicts vulnerable parts of the population and has a substantial adverse impact on children, families, and healthcare systems. Our multidisciplinary team is proposing to use an Artificial Intelligence-powered mHealth tool coupled with a community engagement strategy to revolutionize the detection and monitoring of ECC at the patient level, which may pave the way for improving oral heath among low-income children.",Develop an Artificial Intelligence-powered Smartphone App AICaries for Caries Detection in Children,10105768,R21DE030251,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caregivers', 'Caries prevention', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Clinics', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental caries', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Low income', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Parents', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preschool Child', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'community based participatory research', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'detection sensitivity', 'early childhood', 'education resources', 'empowered', 'field study', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lower income families', 'mHealth', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'performance tests', 'population based', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'restorative treatment', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2021,189800
"Placement Success Predictor: Using Site-Customized Machine Learning Models to Predict the Best Level of Care Placement for Each Child's Behavioral Health Needs ABSTRACT  Hundreds of thousands of children (669,799) were confirmed victims of maltreatment in the United States in 2017; in that same year, of the 442,733 children in foster care, 34% had been in more than one placement and 11% were in a group home or institution. Out-of-home placement decisions have extremely high stakes for the present and future well-being of these children because some placement types, and multiple placements, are associated with poor outcomes. With the Family First Prevention Act, states will be required to pay the average $88,000 per year to keep a child in residential care if that high level of care is not authorized. But which children require --and, more importantly, would benefit-- from a placement in residential care? Decision-making support tools currently used by states to recommend specific level of care (LOC) placements for children do not maximize the rich data and innovative methodological approaches that are being explored in other fields like medicine. In addition, structured decision making (SDM) has been used to guide decisions about risk in child welfare settings but, in comparison to predictive modelling, SDM is limited by the use of a smaller group of factors to make recommendations. Outcome Referrals, Inc. has employed sophisticated machine learning techniques over the past 10 years to risk-adjust behavioral health outcome data for clients using baseline characteristics. Initial models predicted more than 30% of the outcome variance (i.e., it was possible to predict 30% of the variance in how depressed a client would be at follow-up). The next model improved that prediction to more than 50%, and our latest model has increased this to an average of 71%. With the assistance of Phase I NIH SBIR funding, we plan to improve the success rates of children in the child welfare system with an innovative, scientifically-derived product called “Placement Success Predictor.” To guide level-of-care decision-making, this product will use site-customized, machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of an adolescent having a good outcome in a particular placement type in a specific community. We have preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility of developing these models based on work supported by the Duke Endowment Foundation. During this six-month Phase I project, we propose to 1) validate these preliminary machine learning models by applying them to new client data from our partner behavioral health organization, 2) explore options for sharing results of these models to facilitate their use in practice (e.g., aggregate predictions across different domains in a weighted way), 3) assess key stakeholder satisfaction with a new prototype, and 4) develop and test customized models for multiple placement types with a state-wide child welfare and juvenile justice dataset. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Hundreds of thousands of children were confirmed victims of maltreatment in the United States in 2017; in that same year, of the 442,733 children in foster care, approximately one out of 10 were placed in a group home or institution. Out-of-home placement decisions have extremely high stakes for the present and future well-being of these vulnerable children because some placements, and multiple placements, are associated with poor outcomes. The likelihood of success recommendations provided by the proposed “Placement Success Predictor” tool will help placement staff and administrators identify the best placement setting for each child using machine-learning statistics to predict the child’s chances of success in each potential treatment setting.",Placement Success Predictor: Using Site-Customized Machine Learning Models to Predict the Best Level of Care Placement for Each Child's Behavioral Health Needs,10138072,R43MH125486,"['Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Welfare', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'County', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Endowment', 'Family', 'Federal Government', 'Foundations', 'Friction', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Grant', 'Group Homes', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Justice', 'Kidney', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Residential Treatment', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Team Nursing', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care costs', 'cost', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'health organization', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'maltreatment', 'models and simulation', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevention service', 'prototype', 'satisfaction', 'severe mental illness', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'treatment program', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIMH,OUTCOME REFERRALS INC,R43,2021,220720
"Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Although the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has accounted for significant health and economic costs throughout the world, relatively little is known about its effect on children. The first pediatric case of SARS- CoV-2 in the United States was reported on March 2, 2020, and within just three months, over 64,000 cases were confirmed. Even though children, as a group, have been relatively spared from the effects of the virus, there has been an increasing body of evidence to suggest that some may become critically ill. Since a number of children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with severe systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, more research on determinants of disease and long-term outcomes of those affected is critical. Dr. Oliveira is a pediatric infectious disease clinician whose long-term goal is to become an independently funded physician-scientist, who integrates the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and biomedical informatics to detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases. The work described in this proposal builds on the scientific themes he developed throughout his prior training and aims to mechanistically understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in children by integrating three different scientific tools: natural language processing, machine learning, and clinical epidemiology. The first consideration for this K23 award period will be to use novel computational tools to build automated surveillance and data-extraction system that can facilitate the identification and tracking of incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 in children (Aim 1). Using this surveillance system, Dr. Oliveira will create a comprehensive registry and conduct a rigorous, model-based investigation to derive a state-of-the-art prediction model of clinical deterioration in children with SARS-CoV-2 (Aim 2). Last, he will recruit a longitudinal cohort of SARS-Cov-2 and determine the frequency of complications and long-term outcomes after recovery (Aim 3). This mentored research experience will furnish Dr. Oliveira with skills and expertise in various aspects of clinical epidemiology, including the establishment of surveillance systems, conducting longitudinal studies, computer programing, and executing sophisticated analyses of the longitudinal data. Workshops, semester- long courses will complement this practical experience, and one-on-one mentorship by a multidisciplinary team of established, independently funded, internationally respected investigators and pioneers in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, biomedical informatics, and mathematical modeling. After this work, Dr. Oliveira will have produced important science that could improve the care of all the children affected by this pandemic. Furthermore, he will have gained a unique set of skills and built the necessary infrastructure that will allow him to establish a research program integrating the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and informatics to detect, prevent, and respond to future pandemics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fear of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is widespread, and the emotional toll of this virus on our society is enormous. However, relatively little is known about the effects of this virus on children. Empiric estimates on the risks and long-term effects of this virus in children will enable clinicians and policymakers to make informed decisions about both the need for optimal use of preventative and therapeutic interventions as they become available.",Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C,10191775,K23AI159518,"['18 year old', '2019-nCoV', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'COVID-19 surveillance', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hospitalized Child', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric epidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'State Hospitals', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'data access', 'design', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'severe COVID-19', 'skills', 'structured data', 'surveillance data', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,188457
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,10137881,R01AI135114,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enteral', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Vaccines', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical diagnostics', 'diarrheal disease', 'evidence base', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,390449
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,10198671,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'support vector machine', 'tic suppression', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,626493
"Biopsychosocial Phenotypes and Potential Mechanisms in CHARTER Central nervous system (CNS) complications are common among people with HIV (PWH), even those who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). The spectrum of CNS complications is broad, ranging from mild cognitive deficits that do not affect daily functioning to life-threatening encephalitis. Cognitive and mood disorders are among the most common CNS diseases that affect PWH and share a common risk factor, inflammation. Inflammation persists in effectively treated PWH for multiple reasons, including production of HIV RNA and proteins and gut dysbiosis and microbial translocation. CHARTER is a multisite, U.S.-based, neuroHIV cohort study that is funded by NIH and that has investigated CNS disorders in PWH for nearly two decades, during which it has completed more than 6,000 assessments generating more than 10 million data points. CHARTER has made important contributions to understanding the frequency, risk factors, and pathogenesis of these disorders. In recent years, new questions have arisen about the heterogeneity, biological basis, clinical impact, and management of CNS disorders. This debate has highlighted the need to create new classifications of CNS disorders in PWH that are more biology-based. We propose to use methods such as machine learning and an agnostic approach to categorize CHARTER’s high-dimensional neurobehavioral, neuromedical, psychiatric, substance use, and imaging data. Such analyses would yield not just cognitive phenotypes but biopsychosocial (BPS) phenotypes that could identify new mechanisms that lead to clinically useful diagnostic tests, new therapies, and better management of CNS disorders in PWH.  Our overarching goal is to leverage prior investment in CHARTER by using its data and stored specimens to a) better understand cognitive and BPS phenotypes in PWH and b) relate them to biological mechanisms. To accomplish this, we will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to analyze data from CHARTER’s comprehensive assessments with the goal of identifying new cognitive and BPS phenotypes (Aim 1). We will then compare these new phenotypes to high-dimensional data from CHARTER’s completed genomewide association study as well as new data we will generate on inflammation (45-plex bead-based array) and highly novel assays of the microbiome and the metabolome in blood and CSF (Aim 2). Our analyses will include a specific focus how sex affects the observed relationships. To determine if this novel approach relates more strongly to biology than prior methods, we will also compare the performance of the new phenotypes to those defined by the 2007 HAND criteria. This highly innovative application is supported by strong preliminary data, responds well to Office of AIDS Research priorities, and will address key gaps in the field, including the need to better understand the pathogenesis of comorbid disease. Cognitive and mood disorders occur more commonly in people with HIV than in the general population but the field still does not fully understand why and has no effective therapies for most of those who are affected. This project will take a new approach to understanding how cognition, mood, substance use, and medical characteristics cluster together and will identify new biological mechanisms associated with these conditions. The successful project could lead to new diagnostic tests and therapies for these disorders, which would have substantial public health relevance.",Biopsychosocial Phenotypes and Potential Mechanisms in CHARTER,10161628,R01MH125720,"['AIDS dementia', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain imaging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Store', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gut associated lymphoid tissue', 'HIV', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'comorbidity', 'daily functioning', 'disease classification', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'gut dysbiosis', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroAIDS', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,708875
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,10065509,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Well Child Visits', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2021,605422
"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice.

"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group.

"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning.

"Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV), an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences. Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1. The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably, identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological, cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups. This work could also be relevant for disordered attention in other disorders characterized by high levels of RTV (e.g., Autism). PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders pose challenges to neurobiological analysis as they are complex, routinely co-occur, and are operationalized using behavioral symptoms. We propose to examine the neurobiological basis of reaction time variability in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study in order to explore heterogeneity in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

"1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk.

"4/5 CAPER: Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk.

"Severity Predictors Integrating salivary Transcriptomics and proteomics with Multi neural network Intelligence in SARS-CoV2 infection in Children (SPITS MISC) Abstract Children have been disproportionately less impacted by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) compared to adults. However, severe illnesses including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) and respiratory failure have occurred in a small proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly 80% of children with MIS-C are critically ill with a 2-4% mortality rate. Currently there are no modalities to characterize the spectrum of disease severity and predict which child with SARS-CoV-2 exposure will likely develop severe illness including MIS-C. Thus there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic modality to distinguish the varying phenotypes of disease and risk stratify disease. The epigenetic changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles that occur due to an infection can impact disease severity by altering immune response and cytokine regulation which may be detected in body fluids including saliva. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes of children with SARS-CoV-2 by early identification and treatment of those at risk for severe illness. Our central hypothesis is that a model that integrates salivary biomarkers with social and clinical determinants of health will predict disease severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The central hypothesis will be pursued through phased four specific aims. The first two aims will be pursued during the R61 phase and include: 1) Define and compare the salivary molecular host response in children with varying phenotypes (severe and non severe) SARS-CoV-2 infections and 2) Develop and validate a sensitive and specific model to predict severe SARS-CoV-2 illness in children. During the R33 phase we will pursue the following two aims: 3) Develop a portable, rapid device that quantifies salivary miRNAs with comparable accuracy to predicate technology (qRT-PCR), and 4) Develop an artificial intelligence (AI) assisted cloud and mobile system for early recognition of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We will pursue the above aims using an innovative combination of salivaomics and bioinformatics, analytic techniques of AI and clinical informatics. The proposed research is significant because development of a sensitive model to risk stratify disease is expected to improve outcomes of children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection via early recognition and timely intervention. The proximate expected outcome of this proposal is better understanding of the epigenetic regulation of host immune response to the viral infection which we expect to lead to personalized therapy in the future. The results will have a positive impact immediately as it will lead to the creation of patient profiles based on individual risk factors which can enable early identification of severe disease and appropriate resource allocation during the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is relevant to public health as development of a predictive model that integrates salivary biomarkers with clinical and social determinants into a bedside tool will enable early identification of severe COVID-19 in children, ensure appropriate resource allocation and aid in targeted treatment.",Severity Predictors Integrating salivary Transcriptomics and proteomics with Multi neural network Intelligence in SARS-CoV2 infection in Children (SPITS MISC),10273618,R61HD105610,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Coronavirus', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intelligence', 'Interleukin-10', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 genome', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'cloud based', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experience', 'health data', 'immunoregulation', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'personalized medicine', 'point of care', 'portability', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'risk stratification', 'severe COVID-19', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NICHD,CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY,R61,2021,735449
