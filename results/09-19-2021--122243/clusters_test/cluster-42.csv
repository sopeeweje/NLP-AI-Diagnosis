"Title: Neurobiology of seizure generalization during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression PROJECT SUMMARY Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood. Seizure generalization appears to be critical for successful antidepressant response to ECT, and stimulation dose is adjusted to ensure an “adequate” seizure. Previous studies have linked seizure generalization during ECT with thalamocortical regions, and our own MRI studies indicate that thalamocortical networks exhibit neuroplasticity after treatment in patients who respond to ECT. Yet, despite recent growth in the number of MRI studies measuring long-term neuroplasticity across ECT sessions, relatively less is known about the neurobiology of seizure activity elicited during each session. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to understand how ECT-induced seizures change brain networks to treat depression. To address this goal, we will take a data-driven, machine learning approach to pre-existing ECT-MRI datasets of patients with depression, to identify the neurobiological features measured with MRI (functional connectivity, gray-matter morphometry, electric fields) that optimally explain inter-patient variability in seizure indicators (seizure duration and stimulation dose). Aim 1 will identify biomarkers of susceptibility to ECT-induced seizures by analyzing pre-treatment MRI with respect to initial stimulation dose and seizure duration. Aim 2 studies will determine how brain network plasticity over the course of ECT relates to changes in stimulation dose and duration of ECT-induced seizures. These studies will further our understanding of therapeutic seizures in ECT, potentially facilitating prediction of optimal dose and/or treatment outcome to improve ECT and minimize side effects. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood. The proposed studies target characteristics of therapeutic seizures elicited during ECT (seizure duration, stimulation dose) and their relationship to pre-treatment and post-treatment neurobiology measured with pre- existing MRI datasets.",Title: Neurobiology of seizure generalization during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression,10069399,R03MH121769,"['Ache', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disorientation', 'Dose', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Muscle relaxants', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tonic - clonic seizures', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'electric field', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'interpatient variability', 'morphometry', 'mortality', 'motor symptom', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'reduce symptoms', 'response', 'sex', 'side effect', 'social stigma', 'vector']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2021,79417
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,10310774,UH3NS103550,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'clinical implementation', 'connectome', 'control trial', 'evidence base', 'live stream', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'response', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2021,109980
"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. We will leverage expansive electronic health record data from two of the largest healthcare organizations in California to create and validate a new LTBI screening and treatment approach that can vastly improve identification and successful treatment of LTBI.",A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment,10129277,R01AI151072,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'effectiveness measure', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'simulation', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment guidelines', 'wasting']",NIAID,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,798304
"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of ³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) – an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patient’s age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patients’ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from ≥140/90). This could worsen the already low rate of compliance (25-65%) to treatment guidelines. In this study, we will evaluate physician compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guideline and its association with patient BP using electronic health record data that comprises information on several aspects of hypertension care. Findings of this study will help in designing future targeted interventions to enhance compliance to treatment guideline and BP control.",Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure,10111556,K01HL145345,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Side Effects', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prospective', 'provider adherence', 'skills', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2021,121124
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,10177987,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic platform', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,603973
"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world.

"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,10164627,R01MH114873,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,373803
"Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition, they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.  PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived, exposure-based components.  The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130 treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation. Pathological trauma-related dissociation is a significant personal and societal burden. This proposal will examine behavioral and biological correlates of dissociation across imaging, physiology, and digital assessments. Results from this proposal will inform how to identify those at risk for these debilitating symptoms, potential brain regions to target for treatment, and may support a new standard of clinical care for PTSD with dissociation. ",Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation,10129433,R01MH119227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amnesia', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depersonalization', 'Derealizations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Dorsal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbness', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Destructive Behavior', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'digital', 'disabling symptom', 'emotion regulation', 'heart rate variability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted therapy trials', 'time use', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,723138
"Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Adolescent depression is a major public health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We know that adolescent depression varies considerably in severity and course, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This proposal addresses this concern, aiming to identify biobehavioral predictors of illness trajectory in adolescents to inform treatment influencing its course. Our overall hypothesis is that reward dysfunction and its underlying neuro-immunological mechanisms contribute to maintenance of depression in youth. We propose the following model: (1) peripheral inflammation (e.g., cytokines, kynurenines) is associated with anhedonia; (2) inflammation extends to the CNS, inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and GABA (inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neuro-chemical changes alter the reward circuitry, leading to anhedonia, and contribute to depression progression. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia—reflecting deficits in reward processes—and not irritability was associated with worse outcome, including suicidality and chronicity. We also reported associations between circulatory cytokines and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry. Utilizing proton MR spectroscopy (1H MRS), we showed that decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA in adolescent depression was driven by anhedonia. Additionally, using fMRI, we mapped striatal-based connectivity in relation to anhedonia and documented distinct neural activation patterns of reward anticipation and attainment—both reward processes that contribute to anhedonia. In pilot studies, we found that ACC GABA and reward- anticipation brain activation predicted anhedonia severity at 2-year follow-up. Building upon our compelling findings to date, we propose a prospective study of reward processes and neuroimmunological mechanisms, with the goal to identify modifiable pathways predictive of depression course in adolescents. We will study 120 adolescents with depressive symptoms. Three in-laboratory comprehensive clinical evaluation and computerized reward task sessions will be done at baseline, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. At baseline and 12 months, visits will include: a) immune blood collection for kynurenine metabolites, immune cell profiling, and cytokine secretion post immune stimulation (as a biological stressor); b) fMRI resting state and tasks examining distinct reward processes (e.g., anticipation, attainment, learning); and c) 1H MRS to probe ACC GABA and striatal GSH as indices for inflammatory neurometabolic consequences in reward-related brain regions. Outcome measures will include anhedonia severity (primary), along with depression severity, functioning, anxiety, and suicidality. Principled variable selection approach will address multiple comparison concerns. Dynamic causal modeling and machine learning classification methods will explore the relationships among all examined factors.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to the maintenance and severity of adolescent depression. A prospective multimodal study will test the overall hypothesis that reward dysfunction and associated neuroimmunological abnormalities contribute to depression progression in youth. Such work would provide information on modifiable factors to facilitate novel treatment approaches influencing the course of illness early on and prior to chronicity effects, so that we may work to ameliorate morbidity and mortality of this devastating disorder.",Biobehavioral Predictors of Illness Progression in Adolescent Depression,10128500,R01MH120601,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Antioxidants', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protons', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral construct', 'biobehavior', 'causal model', 'cell type', 'child depression', 'cingulate cortex', 'computerized', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pleasure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'reward anticipation', 'reward circuitry', 'sex', 'stressor', 'subthreshold depression']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,786200
"A System for Xerostomia Risk Classification after Head & Neck Cancer Radiotherapy Summary Radiotherapy (RT) is a major component in the treatment of most head and neck cancer (HNC) cases. During irradiation, sensitive regions such as the salivary glands can sustain injury, resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth). This side effect is common and can significantly reduce quality of life during and post-treatment. The focus of this application is prediction during treatment planning of whether patients will suffer high-grade xerostomia (NCI CTCAE Grade 2-3) at the time of their first post-treatment follow-up visit, typically 3-6 months after RT (prevalence is approximately 40%). Predictions will enable clinicians to carry out treatment planning with improved knowledge of the likelihood of high-grade xerostomia development and allow better-informed and more timely anticipation of consequences such as eating difficulty. In this Phase 1 project, Oncospace Inc. will develop a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) prediction model using over 1200 complete HNC patient records. Associations between high-grade xerostomia and a wide range of dosimetric, clinical and demographic features will be automatically discovered and the features with the strongest associations will populate the nodes of a decision tree. The terminal leaf nodes will each contain the probability of high-grade xerostomia for the subset of patients in that node. In addition, leaf nodes will be assigned binary class labels designating a high- or low risk of high-grade xerostomia. This type of model provides transparency and interpretability, which are beneficial for clinical acceptance and for demonstration of safety to regulatory agencies. The software will be built using the Microsoft Azure cloud architecture and be deployed via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. There are three distinct aims of this project:  1. Populate Oncospace Inc.’s Microsoft Azure CosmosDB database with data licensed from Johns Hopkins  University, including steps such as patient de-identification, data curation, and additional dataset feature engineering  2. Perform CART modeling and test model accuracy, using separate training and test datasets and a variety  of performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and F1-score.  3. Design a clinically acceptable risk classification strategy and a user interface (UI) to communicate model  results. Expert input from a team of UI consultants and three radiation oncologists will be an integral part  of the development, testing, and evaluation processes. The successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the clinical and commercial feasibility of a xerostomia prediction model for HNC. Further development in Phase 2 will include deeper model personalization via incorporation of advanced image features (radiomics), as well as validation of model generalizability and commercial viability via the curation and use in model building of data from other institutions. Oncospace, formed in 2018, is uniquely positioned to carry out this work as the team includes the creators of the Pinnacle radiation therapy planning system, Tomotherapy radiation treatment delivery system, and HealthMyne Quantitative Imaging Decision Support platform. Oncospace has close clinical collaboration with Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for clinical feedback, validation and initial deployment. Oncospace has licensed three patents and subscription to complete patient treatment records for over 6,000 radiation oncology patients from JHU. The company has won the Microsoft Innovation Acceleration Award for its innovative platform to deliver AI-enabled healthcare solutions to the radiation oncology community. Page 1 of 1 Narrative During standard-of-care radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, the salivary glands often sustain radiation- induced injury leading to xerostomia (dry mouth). Machine learning-based predictions can be used to help create treatment plans that minimize the chance of severe xerostomia, and to better anticipate and manage its occurrence.

"Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Adolescent Depression via Idiographic Network Modeling of Active and Passive Smartphone Data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adolescents experience escalating risk for developing clinical depression, which can lead to lifelong morbidity and mortality. The neural, physical, cognitive, and socioemotional changes that may contribute to this risk also signal an opportunity for high impact intervention. Unfortunately, psychotherapy trials demonstrate modest effects on youth depression. To improve long-term outcomes for adolescents, this study will identify person- specific drivers of adolescent depression that can guide treatment personalization. Prior research with depressed or anxious adults demonstrates the existence of such drivers—symptoms and related processes that are influential (i.e., predict change in other symptoms), modifiable, and exhibit individual differences. Personalized selection and sequencing of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules to target these drivers early in adults have produced larger treatment effects compared to a historical benchmark. Identifying person- specific drivers during adolescence could inform treatments that account for both developmental and individual differences to shift the trajectory of depression onset and maintenance. Investigating person-specific drivers usually involves intensive surveying of self-reported experience via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Emerging evidence suggests that smartphones can also monitor mood through passive sensing of depression-related behaviors with minimal response burden. However, nearly all such studies have been conducted with adults, despite near universal smartphone ownership among adolescents in the US. Thus, this study will leverage depressed adolescents' everyday smartphone use to assess the validity of mobile sensing against established ambulatory methods (i.e., EMA and actigraphy) to identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression. Fifty adolescents (12–18 years old) with elevated depressive symptoms will participate in 30 days of: a) smartphone-based EMA of depressive symptoms, processes, and affect (4x/day), sleep diary (1x/day); (b) mobile sensing of mobility, physical activity, sleep, natural language use in typed interpersonal communication, screen-on time and call frequency/duration; and (c) wrist actigraphy of physical activity and sleep. Adolescents and caregivers will complete diagnostic interviews and other measures (e.g., developmental, clinical, Research Domain Criteria) at baseline, as well as user feedback interviews at follow- up. To address study aims: 1) idiographic, within-subject networks of EMA symptoms will be modeled to identify each adolescent's drivers; 2) correlations among EMA, mobile sensor, and actigraph measures of sleep, physical, and social activity; and machine learning prediction of core depressive symptoms (self- reported mood and anhedonia) will be used to assess the validity of mobile sensing for identifying person- specific drivers; 3) between-subject baseline characteristics will be explored as predictors of person-specific drivers. These results will inform future development of a scalable, low-burden smartphone-based tool that can guide personalized treatment decisions for depressed adolescents, with potential public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescence is marked by escalating risk for developing clinical depression, but also presents an optimal window for high impact intervention to alter the course of this often disabling disorder. To inform future efforts to personalize psychological interventions for depressed adolescents and maximize their efficacy, the proposed study will identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression—influential and modifiable symptoms and processes that exhibit individual differences—and demonstrate the validity of using a smartphone tool to identify these person-specific drivers. The proposed study will generate data to inform the development of a scalable, low-burden, smartphone-based tool to guide treatment decisions, with potential public health impact given near-universal smartphone ownership among adolescents across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the US.",Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Adolescent Depression via Idiographic Network Modeling of Active and Passive Smartphone Data,10196290,R21MH126394,"['18 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Communication', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'anxious', 'base', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'diaries', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'network models', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'racial and ethnic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,198257
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures,10140420,R00MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive signature', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2021,248878
"Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of the proposed K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, theoretical knowledge, and research skills to develop into a fully independent psychophysiological researcher studying biomarkers of depression that can be used as targets for novel interventions. In consultation with her mentors, the PI has recruited a team of expert consultants to guide her in executing a research project and training plan that will provide experience essential to her goals.  The proposed study will be conducted at the ALACRITY Center of the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. The study focuses on late-life depression because it is prevalent and has negative outcomes. Existing treatments have low response rates and are rarely used correctly in the community due to their complexity. The project is based on the premise that focused treatments targeting biosignatures of specific neural abnormalities will have the greatest impact on clinical outcomes in late-life depression. It concentrates on positive valence systems, which are vulnerable to aging and often impaired in depression. The project will investigate positive valence systems in older adults with major depression receiving Engage, a psychotherapy designed to reactivate reward system functions. Engage has been found efficacious in late-life depression and easy to learn by community-based therapists. Consistent with RDoC methods, the proposed study will examine target engagement of Engage in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) during a 9-week course of Engage therapy, using three units of analysis to assess positive valence system function: physiology (event-related potentials), self-reports, and behavior. It will compare Engage-treated participants with 35 depressed participants, group-matched on age, receiving manualized supportive therapy. Additional analyses will assess whether low baseline positive valence function, or increases in positive valence function during treatment, predict improvement of anhedonia with Engage, and whether reward function mediates change in anhedonia.  The proposed training plan complements the research study with individualized tutorials, formal coursework, research collaborations, and manuscript preparation that will provide the PI with knowledge and skills in several areas: 1) Age-related neurobiological changes in the positive valence system and related networks; 2) Advanced statistical techniques to identify distinct neural abnormalities in depressed individuals based on their ERP profiles; and 3) Clinical trial design for psychotherapeutic interventions. The proposed project may provide important information about target engagement and mechanisms of a biologically informed, easily implemented treatment for late-life depression that has potential for dissemination. It will also provide pilot data for an R-series study using machine learning methods to predict response to Engage and will serve as an important stepping-stone for the PI as she prepares for an independent research career. Late-life depression is prevalent and devastating, and response rates to even the most effective treatments are low. Outcomes may be improved by developing targeted interventions such as Engage – a new, easily disseminated, neurobiologically informed psychotherapy for late-life depression designed to restore impaired function of the positive valence system. The proposed study will use event-related potentials and a panel of other positive valence system measures to assess target engagement in 35 depressed older adults (age ≥ 60) receiving Engage therapy, with a comparison group of 35 age-group-matched depressed peers receiving supportive therapy.",Positive Valence System Function and Reward Exposure Therapy for Late-Life Depression,10194608,K23MH116105,"['Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuscripts', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positive Valence', 'Preparation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Stimulus', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Visual attention', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'biosignature', 'career', 'career development', 'comparison group', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning community', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'opioid user', 'peer', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'trait']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2021,190534
"1/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric disorders Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. IN particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD.

"2/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric diorders Abstract  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. In particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 25,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,200 antipsychotic-treated individuals.

"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing.,10023371,R44MH122067,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bile fluid', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social support', 'Solid', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'aged', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'health belief', 'health care service utilization', 'health service use', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric patients', 'persistent symptom', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'remote screening', 'routine screening', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'social media', 'suicide rate', 'system architecture', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'university student', 'usability']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R44,2021,790709
"Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients ABSTRACT  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that likely involves multiple underlying pathological mechanisms, which has plagued attempts to identify rational therapeutic targets. All available antipsychotic drugs (APD) are dopamine receptor antagonists, but clinical response is variable, with a third of patients being partial responders, and a third non-responders. Arguably, those who respond well to APD have primarily dopaminergic abnormalities but it is imperative to also characterize the specific underlying pathologies in those with poor response in order to unravel the heterogeneity of psychosis and effectively develop new treatments. We propose to longitudinally follow treatment response to APD for eight months in medication-naïve first episode psychosis (FEP) subjects using complementary brain imaging techniques.  We already have identified provisional markers for several different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychosis, including abnormalities in glutamate, brain connectivity, and neurodevelopment that we can track with brain imaging. In addition, we propose to study the changes that occur in the brain in early compared to delayed treatment responders and changes that occur over time in response to treatment. By characterizing treatment trajectories and their relationship to baseline pathophysiologic alterations, we will further complement our mechanistic understanding of the heterogeneity of psychosis.  We propose to study 60 well-characterized FEP subjects who are medication naïve and treat them with the most frequently used APD for 32 weeks. We will follow a rigorous longitudinal design to capture treatment response whereby those without an adequate response after 16 weeks of treatment will be switched to another APD for 16 weeks. All patients will be scanned four times: at baseline and after 6, 16, and 32 weeks of treatment. We will use (1) proton MR Spectroscopy (MRS), (2) task and resting state functional MRI and (3) MRI and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to measure brain biochemistry, function and structure. Using several imaging modalities has the potential to interrogate different neurobiological aspects of treatment response and will offer greater opportunities for clustering the patterns and combinations of the underlying pathologies in those with poor response.  Deconstructing the heterogeneity of psychosis has broad implications for the identification of specific targets for drug development, and to lay the groundwork needed to conduct therapeutic trials on patients characterized by their specific underlying psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and present treatment only works for a limited number of patients. In order to identify new therapeutic targets, we will longitudinally characterize the underlying pathologies in those with poor treatment response using complimentary brain imaging modalities.",Trajectories of treatment response as window into the heterogeneity of psychosis: a longitudinal multimodal imaging study in medication-naieve first episode psychosis patients,10075321,R01MH113800,"['Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine Antagonists', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Protons', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Risperidone', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'aripiprazole', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'brain abnormalities', 'cingulate cortex', 'drug development', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'longitudinal design', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'new therapeutic target', 'patient subsets', 'response', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,816340
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Outcomes from this study will inform clinical guidelines for effective language treatment in PPA, which can be adapted for other dementia syndromes.",Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia,10129873,R01AG055425,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Aphasia', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical care', 'design', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'experimental arm', 'experimental group', 'language impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized care', 'premature', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'restoration', 'skills', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment response', 'trial design', 'web app', 'web-based intervention']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,924106
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation Project summary Computational multi-scale modeling is a growing area of research that aims to link whole slide images and radiographic iamges with multi-omics molecular profiles of the same patients. Multi-scale modeling has shown its potential through its ability to predict clinical outcomes e.g. prognosis, and through predicting actionable molecular properties of tumors, e.g. the activity of EGFR, a major drug target in many cancers. Current applications are limited to study associations between imaging and molecular data, and predicting long term outcomes. No actionable information can be gained from multi-scale biomarkers yet. We propose to develop a multi-scale modeling framework to support treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation for patients with brain tumors, focusing on the most aggressive subtype of glioma, IDH wild-type high grade glioma. In Aim 1, we will develop informatics algorithms that integrate multi-scale data for treatment response. We will use our expertise in data fusion and develop novel approaches to integrate multi- scale data to predict first line treatment response. In Aim 2, we will develop algorithms that allow combining multi-scale data at diagnosis with multi-modal MR imaging data during treatment follow-up. We will focus on predicting treatment response and progression and whether we can predict these events earlier than radiologists can. In Aim 3, we will develop algorithms that use the multi-scale data to predict drug target activities and also suggest novel drugs for patients that become resistant to first line treatment. We will use a mixture of publicly available glioma multi-scale data sets totaling more than 1000 patients, and also 1600 retrospective and 150 prospective brain tumor patients from Stanford Medical Center. Combining these complementary data sources in a multi-scale framework for data fusion can have profound contributions toward predicting treatment outcomes by uncovering unknown synergies and relationships. More specifically, developing computational models integrating quantitative image features and molecular data to develop multi-scale signatures, holds the potential to translate in benefit to brain tumor patients by investigating biomarkers that accurately predict treatment response. Readily, because whole slide images and radiographic imaging is part of the routine diagnostic work-up of cancer patients and molecular data of brain tumors is increasingly being used in clinical workflows, therefore if reliable multi-scale signatures can be found reflecting treatment response, translation to clinical applications is feasible, including optimizing recruitment for clinical trials. Narrative We propose a multi-scale framework for treatment allocation, treatment follow-up and treatment monitoring to provide precision medicine for brain tumor patients. We will develop algorithms integrating clinical, molecular and imaging data for therapeutic purposes. We will focus on the development of multi-scale biomarkers that are predictive of treatment response, suggest the use of novel drugs and help during treatment monitoring.","Multi-scale modeling of glioma for the prediction of treatment response, treatment monitoring and treatment allocation",10184938,R01CA260271,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Repair Enzymes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Link', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer site', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data fusion', 'digital pathology', 'epigenetic silencing', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'methylation pattern', 'molecular imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'multiscale data', 'mutational status', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'pathology imaging', 'patient biomarkers', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'response', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'synergism', 'temozolomide', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,612041
"Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection PROJECT SUMMARY The overall purpose of this proposal is to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome in kidney transplant rejection, specifically in T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR), as the response to treatment can be variable, is currently not predictable by clinical diagnostics nor understood from a mechanistic sense, and even partial treatment failure is associated with shortened graft longevity. In each aim, we make use of residual diagnostic biopsy samples with paired richly-detailed clinical data and timelines including treatments, graft functional responses and outcomes. In this manner, we track along the clinical timeline of TCMR, with each aim addressing an unsolved clinical problem in the field. Through the same approach, experimental data from this unique “model system” of tissue inflammation studied over time provides a rich discovery set for understanding tissue-resident T cell behavior in the human kidney. Aim 1 looks at the whole transcriptome profiles of initial acute episodes of TCMR prior to treatment, to identify a gene expression signature predictive of resistance/sensitivity to standard therapies for rejection. When treatment fails, grafts frequently contain residual T cell infiltrates, but the causal connection between these cells and long- term outcome is unclear. For example, residual infiltrates may represent (i) contracting/egressing populations of T cells effectively treated, (ii) newly recruited T cells mounting a fresh rejection response where repeat therapy may be prudent, or (iii) scant memory T cells with established tissue posts and capable of inciting repeat inflammation. Therefore, in Aim 2, we focus on post-treatment biopsies of treatment failure, characterizing multiple spatio-phenotypic aspects of the T cell infiltrate by high dimensional immunofluorescence microscopy with digital image processing and quantitative spatial analysis, to determine which functional phenotypic T cell subsets in which specific tissue niches, correlate with poor graft outcomes. These complementary but independent aims will be achieved through established cross-disciplinary collaborations and with partial industry support. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney transplantation is life saving and compared to dialysis improves patient quality of life and decreases healthcare costs over time, but graft longevity is compromised by immunologic rejection and inadequate immunosuppression. Timely appropriate therapy for rejection can preserve graft longevity, but biomarkers to predict response to therapy are lacking, leading some centers to over-treat, putting patients at risk of infection and malignancy, while clinical protocols at other centers may under-treat, putting patients at risk of accelerated graft decline. Therefore, development of tests to guide appropriate selection of therapy for rejection would be clinically useful, and discovery-based platforms for biomarker identification have the potential to yield not only clinically useful tests but also to reveal biologic mechanisms of treatment resistance and potential new targets for therapy.",Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection,10128898,R21AI151491,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Allografting', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Epidemiology', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Failure', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Immunofluorescence Microscopy', 'Immunologics', 'Immunosuppression', 'In Situ', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Steroid Resistance', 'Steroids', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker identification', 'cell behavior', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'graft function', 'health economics', 'high dimensionality', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'kidney allograft', 'migration', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,266691
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,10063043,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,498501
"Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and easy-to-tolerate treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). TMS is costly and time-intensive so identifying markers of response would reduce financial and psychological burden. Further, treatment response is highly variable. Clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity of depression contributes to significant variability in neural markers of response. The literature on neural markers is complicated by variability in TMS intensity and targets, which may further modify response. Electrical field models estimate the degree to which a target is stimulated by considering both the intensity and structural information of each participant but at this time there are no studies that have investigated the association between brain electrical fields and treatment response. Moreover, the neurobiological correlates of dorsolateral (dlPFC) TMS treatment response are not well understood. Machine learning may be able to help us understand these complex set of features and their association to treatment response. Thus to appropriately personalize treatments, I will develop a data-driven machine learning model that uses the following: (1) pre- treatment resting state connectivity that reflects circuit dysregulation; (2) electrical field modeling to estimate the electrical field or voltage on individual patient’s brain, as a marker of sufficiency of stimulation; and (3) expected target network connectivity as a marker of target engagement. We have previously demonstrated feasibility of machine learning to predict antidepressant response in MDD. We will optimize and expand a model developed on archival University of Toronto data that predicted dlPFC TMS response. We will validate this externally on three sets of data: data we collect at University of Pittsburgh, archival data from Brown University, and sham TMS data. As an exploratory aim, we will identify whether our model that predicts dlPFC TMS treatment response is capable of predicting response to dmPFC TMS stimulation. During my PhD in Bioengineering, I developed kernel-based machine learning models to personalize neural networks markers of antidepressant response. Given the clinical and neural heterogeneity of depression, I will leverage my machine learning and neuroimaging experience by receiving training in advanced optimization approaches and depression neurobiology to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments. This will allow me to develop optimized models of treatment response and facilitate my long-term career goal to develop personalized treatment algorithms using large-scale data. My previous experiences in machine learning, bioengineering, neuroimaging, as well as the preliminary understanding of depression uniquely position me to maximize the benefits of training aims outlined in this proposal. 1 This is a K01 application designed to develop a data-driven machine learning model that will take into account several neural markers of response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The application proposes expanded training in machine learning optimization approaches and depression neurobiology for the applicant, who has a PhD in Bioengineering. The goal of the study is to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments, which matches the candidate’s long-term goal to conduct research on and develop models that personalize medicine for depression. 1",Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD,10125330,K01MH122741,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Archives', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Placebos', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Universities', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'electric field', 'executive function', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'large scale data', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'support vector machine', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'voltage']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2021,170027
"Identifying treatment responders in medication trials for AUD using machine learning approaches ABSTRACT Alcohol use disorder (AUD), as defined in DSM-5, represents a highly prevalent, costly, and often untreated condition in the United States. Pharmacotherapy offers a promising avenue for treating AUD and for improving clinical outcomes for this debilitating disorder. While developing novel medications to treat AUD remains a high priority research area, there remain major opportunities to further elucidate clinical response in completed medication trials. To that end, a key question in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is which patients respond to a given pharmacotherapy. Identifying treatment responders provides major opportunities to advance clinical care for AUD by personalizing medication practices on the bases of variables/predictors of good clinical response. For example, while the effect size for medications such as naltrexone is deemed small-to-moderate, a host of studies over the past decade have shown that its effect size may be considerably larger for certain subgroups of patients. Towards advancing precision medicine for AUD and leveraging data from a host of carefully conducted RCTs for AUD, this R03 application seeks to conduct secondary data analysis. Specifically, we propose to analyze data from four RCTs conducted by the NIAAA Clinical Investigations Group (NCIG). These state-of-the-art RCTs for AUD have tested the following pharmacotherapies: (a) quetiapine, (b) Levetiracetam XR (Keppra XR®), (c) Varenicline (Chantix®), and (d) HORIZANT® (Gabapentin Enacarbil) Extended-Release. In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in the NCIG RCTs. Machine learning represents a highly promising and underutilized data analytic strategy in the field of AUD treatment response. Machine learning models prioritize the ability to predict future outcomes over creating perfectly fitting models for the data at hand. This results in models which are more generalizable to future observations, which fits well with our goal of identifying responders in RCTs. Leveraging data from these pivotal RCTs through secondary data analysis and using novel analytic methods, namely machine learning, provides a cost-effective approach to identifying AUD pharmacotherapy responders. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in pivotal clinical trials for AUD.

"Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY About 2/3 of cancer patients in US receive radiation therapy either alone or in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. Treatment planning, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, is analogous to the design of a blueprint for building construction. If a treatment plan is poorly designed, the desired treatment outcome cannot be achieved, no matter how well other components of radiation therapy are performed. In the current clinical workflow, a treatment planner works towards a good quality plan in a trial-and-error fashion. Many rounds of consultation between the planner and physician are needed to reach a plan of physician's satisfaction, because physician's preference for a particular patient can hardly be quantified and precisely conveyed to the planner. Consequently, planning time can be up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor and can vary significantly due to varying levels of physician and planner's skills and physician-planner cooperation, etc., which substantially deteriorates treatment outcomes. For example, head and neck (H&N) cancer patients treated with suboptimal plans present 20% lower 2-year overall survival and 24% higher 2-year local-regional failure. Prolonged overall treatment process due to treatment planning reduces local-regional control rate by 12–14% per week. Furthermore, as patient's anatomy can rapidly change within the planning time, the optimally designed plan becomes inappropriate for the changed anatomy. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made colossal advancements. We believe that AI technologies have a great potential to revolutionize treatment planning. Treatment planning consists of two major aspects: commonality and individuality. By exploiting the commonality through deep supervised learning, we can develop a treatment plan as good as those for previously treated similar patients. The individuality can be actualized by learning physician's special considerations for a particular patient using deep reinforcement learning. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated feasibility of these ideas. We hypothesize that an AI-based intelligent treatment planning system can consistently produce high-quality treatment plans with extremely high efficiency. This hypothesis will be tested using H&N cancer patients as a test bed via two aims. Aim 1, System development. Develop two deep-learning models to realize the proposed treatment planning workflow and incorporate them into a clinical environment. Aim 2, System validation. Acquire and analyze planning data before and after system implementation. The innovation of this project is the use and customization of the state-of-the-art AI techniques to solve a clinically important problem. These technologies would revolutionize treatment planning process, leading to the efficient generation of consistently high quality plans, irrespective of human skills, experiences, and communications, etc. Besides the significance demonstrated for the H&N cancer patients, the system can be easily extended to other tumor sites, yielding more substantial impacts. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal and varying quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. This project will use and customize the state-of- the-art artificial intelligence techniques to develop an intelligent treatment planning system that is capable of efficiently and consistently generating high quality plans.",Intelligent treatment planning for cancer radiotherapy,10190850,R01CA237269,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Beds', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Consultations', 'Curiosities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Generations', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individuality', 'Intelligence', 'Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'negative affect', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,490133
"Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is an impairing and prevalent mood disorder in adolescence, affecting 1 in 6 youth by age 18. So far, the use of conventional statistical approaches has had limited success in delivering tools for accurate individualized prediction of future depression for a specific child. The objective of this project is to build advanced non-linear machine learning algorithms integrating information from multiple sources to deliver accurate, individualized prediction. To accomplish this objective, the research team will use 5,000 variables (biological, cognitive, socio-emotional, environmental) measured on multiple occasions between the prenatal period and age 10 in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 15,636). The goal is to use features from the prenatal period to age 10 to estimate risk of reaching clinical levels of depressive symptoms between the ages of 12 and 18 years old. The research team will pursue two specific aims. The first aim is to build an algorithm for accurate prediction of adolescent depression by using informative features from the prenatal period until age 10 with machine learning methods that capture complex, multi-variate associations. The team will use several techniques, including artificial neural networks that exploit temporal information (recurrent neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to identify constellations of highly predictive features. Based on early-life stress sensitization theory, the first hypothesis is that features from the prenatal and early postnatal periods (up to age 5) provide greater predictive power than features from ages 6-10. The second aim is to determine if features predicting depression are unique to depression or shared with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder. Machine learning algorithms will predict age 18 clinical diagnoses of depression, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder. The team will test the second hypothesis that some predictive features will be unique for each disorder and some will be shared across all three disorder types (e.g., childhood trauma). By accomplishing these aims, the research team will devise a clinically useful algorithm to estimate a child’s probability of developing adolescent depression. All software that will be created for this project will be open-source, and made freely available online in public repositories. Algorithms that would allow accurate early identification of children at risk to develop depression during future adolescent years would provide new avenues for preemptive interventions. This would yield enormous public health benefits by prioritizing treatment and shifting developmental trajectories away from eventual disorder for millions of individuals worldwide. To realize the potential of this overall impact on the field and society, predictive models that calculate risk with high sensitivity and specificity in childhood are needed. The proposed project aims to use robust, rigorous machine learning algorithms to take on this challenge. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on depression in adolescence, which is highly prevalent and impairing during this life stage and a major risk factor for suicide. The project is relevant to NIMH’s mission because it aims to identify early behavioral and biological indicators of risk for depression in order to predict the onset of illness and support early preemptive interventions.",Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning,10108555,R21MH125346,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crude Extracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'developmental psychology', 'early life stress', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'long short term memory network', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'maltreatment', 'open source', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'postnatal period', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prenatal', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public repository', 'recurrent neural network', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2021,179604
"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression. It will help personalize depression treatment by identifying patients who are failing treatments early and will assist providers to take necessary actions before patients drop out of treatment.",SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics ,10196980,R01MH119678,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Drops', 'Early treatment', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Health Technology', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'data de-identification', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'feature selection', 'global health', 'heterogenous data', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2021,245551
"Validating of Machine Learning-Based EEG Treatment Biomarkers in Depression SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching aim of Alto Neuroscience is to advance brain-based biomarkers for psychiatric disorders in order to both optimize treatment pathways and drive the development of novel pharmacological and non- pharmacological interventions. Alto does this by developing and applying sophisticated machine learning computational models to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected at scale in real-world clinical treatment contexts. Specifically, in this direct-to-phase II SBIR proposal we will refine, and then independently validate, two EEG-based candidate biomarkers we have identified for stratifying patients with depression in a manner that both factors biological heterogeneity and informs treatment response. One of our biomarkers was derived in a “top-down” (i.e. supervised) manner by trying to directly predict treatment outcome, while the other biomarker presents a complimentary “bottom-up” (i.e. unsupervised) approach that begins by first identifying the most biologically homogeneous subset of patients and then testing the treatment relevance of the subtyping. Together, these findings represent very robust individual patient-level treatment-relevant EEG biomarkers, and in both cases, help define a critically-important objective approach to prospectively identifying and treating treatment- resistant depressed patients. A successful outcome of the proposed work would yield the first FDA-cleared biomarkers for stratifying psychiatric conditions. It would also provide a basis for targeted development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions based on the EEG biomarkers. Both outcomes hold substantial commercial value and exciting potential for transforming psychiatry.

"Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life ABSTRACT: Emotion regulation (ER) is a key transdiagnostic process and treatment target, with particular relevance to distress disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder). Distress disorders, which are characterized by heightened negative emotions, are prevalent conditions with considerable public health burden and comparatively lower response to treatment. The efficacy of interventions for distress disorders may be improved by investigating components of effective ER, both as instructed in the lab (ER capacity) and as measured naturalistically in daily life (ER tendency). Effective ER is based on key components such as accurate perceptions of one's emotions (i.e., emotional awareness) as well sensitivity to the environmental context (i.e., contextual sensitivity), which facilitate the selection and implementation of the appropriate ER strategy. For individuals with distress disorders, elevated levels of perseverative negative thinking (PNT) interferes with these processes, contributing to ER deficits and increased symptoms. This contextualized and integrative model of ER in distress disorders has not been tested, and very little is known about the predictors or outcomes of effective ER tendency—a critical gap given that ER capacity is irrelevant if ER is not employed skillfully in daily life. Furthermore, examinations of ER tendency can show how individuals, considering their particular characteristics and abilities, can optimally match particular ER strategies to the specific situations they encounter. The goal of this application is to evaluate components of ineffective ER— both in the lab and in daily life— that influence the severity and course of distress disorders and functioning. Consistent with NIMH strategic objectives and the RDoC framework, this project incorporates multimodal assessment, dimensional symptom measurement, and machine learning approaches. The proposed study will be comprised of 300 adults, oversampled for elevated PNT (50%). Participants will complete a lab assessment to measure predictors of ER capacity, followed by a 10- day ecological momentary assessment study examining predictors of ER tendency in daily life. To better capture negative emotions as they occur, reports in daily life will be physiologically-triggered with algorithms that detect potential episodes of psychological stress. Effective ER will be operationalized in multiple ways in the lab and in daily life, using self-reported changes in affect, physiological indices, and perceived ER success. Effective ER capacity and tendency will then be examined as predictors of distress symptom, functioning, and well-being trajectories assessed monthly for 12 months. Additionally, an exploratory aim is to create predictive models from a multifaceted battery of theoretically motivated variables that impact ER tendency and subsequent clinical outcomes. To this end, machine learning will be used to build a clinically-relevant framework for how person- level, situation-level, and ER strategy use interact to predict optimal ER. Overall, this project contributes to the long-term goal of identifying and refining targets for personalized interventions, by more precisely isolating key mechanisms of effective ER for specific individuals and the contexts they encounter in their daily lives. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine predictors (i.e., emotional awareness, contextual sensitivity, perseverative negative thinking) of dysfunctional emotion regulation that contribute to depression and anxiety, as well as to provide an initial framework for optimal emotion regulation in individualized daily life contexts. This study uses multiple measurements (behavioral, psychophysiological, self-report, clinical interview) in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings in daily life, and it focuses on dimensional and transdiagnostic features that underlie multiple disorders. Consistent with NIMH's mission, findings will be relevant to public health because they can help refine intervention targets and inform personalized treatment for depression and anxiety, which are common and impairing conditions.",Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life,10162664,R01MH118218,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Applications Grants', 'Arousal', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'comparative', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'random forest', 'response', 'success', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,R01,2021,428695
"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App,10111569,R21MH119450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure to Thrive', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Psychometrics', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'motherhood', 'natural language', 'patient subsets', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'pregnant', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'routine screening', 'smartphone Application', 'social culture', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,194684
"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,10299634,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'fractionated radiation', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,H.

"Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. Despite efforts to characterize the pathophysiology of PTSD and its heterogenity, no objective biomarker have been established to aid in diagnosis, and prediction of treatment response. This K01 presents a program for research and training that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an independent investigator, focused on utilizing a data-driven computational approach and machine learning techniques to identify multimodal neural biomarkers of PTSD (supervised) and multimodal biotypes of PTSD (unsupervised) and explore whether such biotypes could be used to predict response to prolonged exposure (PE), the first line treatment for PTSD. The training plan builds on the candidate’s prior training and experience and capitalizes on a mentorship team and a research environment to foster development of the candidate’s expertise in 1) the neural and behavioral basis of PTSD and anxiety disorders; 2) multimodal data fusion analysis and latent dimension interpretation with data-driven computational approaches and data reproducibility; and 3) patient-oriented translational research in anxiety disorders. This research project will apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques on multimodal MRI data from the largest existing PTSD dataset (N~3000 from the ENIGMA-PTSD working group). Biotypes identified from this large dataset will then be extended to clinical treatment data. The results of the proposed research will be vital to aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets and will lead to a future R01 grant examining brain-symptoms association across anxiety and trauma-related disorders, and to use the newly identified PTSD biotypes to inform different treatment outcomes in a following R61/33. Together, the research and training experiences and expertise developed through this K01 award will support the applicant’s transition to research independence and ensure the applicant becomes a leading authority in the application of data-driven computational approaches in psychiatry research, and provide the basis for future NIMH grants to explore biotypes from multimodal brain imaging using data-driven computational approaches across anxiety-related disorders. PTSD can occur after a direct or indirect traumatic experience and is a highly prevalent and debilitating disorder. This research project use a big data and data-driven approaches to study the heterogenity of PTSD. In the long term, this line of research will aid in finding neural biomarkers of PTSD and better predict different treatment outcomes through different biotype targets, which will advance the development of effective diagnostics and treatments for PTSD.",Identification of Distinct Multimodal Biotypes of PTSD Using Data Driven Approach: A Multisite Big Data Study,10127376,K01MH122774,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'associated symptom', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'comorbidity', 'data fusion', 'design', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'individualized medicine', 'large datasets', 'memory process', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development', 'trauma exposure', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment research', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning', 'working group']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2021,176916
"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms.

"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care.

"Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB) The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however, remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness. Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX- CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC. We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM) scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness. A substantial proportion of early psychosis EP individuals show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices provided by coordinated specialty care (CSC). Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond and who will not. In this project we will leverage recent progress in the development of pathophysiologically informed MRI based imaging biomarkers along with novel computational image analysis, to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform clinical decision making to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness.",Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB),10194614,R01MH122139,"['Adjuvant', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clozapine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuromelanin', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychosocial', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,710640
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,10051424,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,532914
"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment with ECT, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more efficient use of ECT, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with refractory illness. Simultaneously, this proposal will develop the career of the Principal Investigator, Miklos Argyelan, M.D., as an independent translational researcher.",Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia,10119330,K23MH120504,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electrodes', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Principal Investigator', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'bioelectricity', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electric field', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'translational scientist', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,K23,2021,195480
"Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation therapy is one of the major approaches for cancer treatment. Treatment planning, the process of designing the optimal treatment plan for each patient, is one of the most critical steps. If a treatment is poorly designed, a satisfactory outcome cannot be achieved, regardless of the quality of other treatment steps. Treatment planning in modern radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem defined by a set of hyperparameters. While there exists several quantifiable metrics to quantify plan quality and guide the planning process, these are simplified representations that cannot fully describe the physician’s intent. In addition, these metrics only measure plan quality from a population-based perspective, and cannot guide treatment planning to achieve the patient-specific best treatment plans. Hence, the best physician-preferred solution often sits in a gray area, only achievable by an extensive trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning process and interactions between the planner and physician. Consequently, planning time can take up to a week for complex cases and plan quality may be poor, if the planner is inexperienced and/or under heavy time constraints. These consequences substantially deteriorate treatment outcomes, as having been clearly demonstrated in clinical studies. Recently, the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in imitation learning allows human- like decision making by observing a human expert’s actions and internally building its own decision-making system. In response to PAR-18-530, the goal of this project is to develop and translate an AI planner that mimics human experts’ behavior to generate a high quality plan. The AI planner will not replace human planners. Instead, the AI plan will be used as a starting point in the current planning process to improve plan quality and planning efficiency. The human planner’s actions on further plan improvement can feed back to the AI planner through continuous learning for its continuous evolution. We will pursue this goal using prostate cancer as the test bed through an academic-industrial partnership, jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc. The following specific aims are defined. Aim 1: Model and algorithm development. We will collect experts’ behavior data in routine treatment planning and train the AI planner. Aim 2: System validation and translation. We will integrate the AI planner into Varian Eclipse treatment planning system and validate the system in a clinically realistic setting. The innovations include the use of a state-of-the-art AI imitation learning algorithm to solve a clinically important problem, the novel technological capabilities enabled by the developed system, as well as coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end users. Deliverability is ensured by extensive preliminary studies and the partnership integrating complementary expertise and resources. Clinical translation of the AI planner will bring substantial impacts to radiotherapy by providing high-quality and efficient treatment planning to benefit patients, especially those in resource-limited regions. NARRATIVE Treatment planning for radiation therapy, where an optimal treatment strategy is designed for each individual patient and executed for the whole treatment course, plays a central role for the success of radiation therapy treatment. The current treatment planning workflow is inefficient and produces plans with sub-optimal quality, substantially deteriorating treatment outcomes. Jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc, this project will develop and translate an artificial intelligence planner that is capable of efficiently generating high quality treatment plans.",Human-like automated radiotherapy treatment planning via imitation learning,10143143,R01CA254377,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Due Process', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Step', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'experience', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning progression', 'model development', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'population based', 'product development', 'prototype', 'response', 'routine practice', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,626797
"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target. Achieving and maintaining blood pressure target will reduce the incidence of adverse events [stroke (35-40%), heart failure (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (15-25%)] or death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension.",PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target,10159301,R44HL140624,"['Acute', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Euclidean Space', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Women&apos', 's Role', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative efficacy', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'hypertension treatment', 'innovation', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,715983
"Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression DESCRIPTION: Over the past decades, antidepressants and psychotherapy have been the first-line treatments for LLD. Despite being safe and well-tolerated, a large number of patients do not achieve full and persistent remission after initial treatment. About 50% of patients with LLD do not respond after two antidepressant trials, meeting the consensus definition of treatment resistance (TR-LLD). The persistence of chronic and elevated depressive symptoms in older adults has significant clinical and public health implications. This has been correlated to poor general health, reduced quality of life, and a higher risk of mortality when compared to those with sustained remission after treatment. Despite the relevance to public health of TR-LLD, there is little information about the biological mechanisms and no robust clinical prediction model to evaluate at the outset of antidepressant therapy who will or will not respond to treatment. Leveraging an NIMH funded clinical trial, the Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission” (IRL-GREY), across 3 sites, in this study, we propose to evaluate the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression and to develop a machine learning based algorithm for prediction of treatment response in these subjects. We will carry out a comprehensive, multiplexed proteomic analysis on 542 samples from patients who completed phase 1 and phase 2 of the clinical trial. We hypothesise that ageing-related biological pathways (i.e. inflammatory response control, proteostasis control, cell damage response, endothelial function) will be associated with poorer treatment response in LLD. Moreover, we hypothesize that a machine learning derived biomarker panel will have sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% to predict treatment response in LLD. Finally, we will evaluate the biological mechanisms related to different depressive symptoms trajectories after treatment. This work will set the stage for a biologically-driven model of treatment response that will be useful to guide, at the outset of antidepressant treatment, those who will benefit more from a specific treatment. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting depression and reduce suffering for large numbers of elderly and their families. Using advanced molecular approaches, we will determine the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression. Our proposed study will also develop a predictive tool combining neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and protein data to identify who with late-life depression is more likely to have no benefit from antidepressant treatment at the outset of therapy. The goal of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression, and whether we can effectively identify those who will benefit from antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment.",Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression,10129431,R01MH118311,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Disease remission', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'aripiprazole', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proteostasis', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'venlafaxine']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R01,2021,490569
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,10087504,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'substance use treatment', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2021,158923
"Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy Project Summary  Radiotherapy (RT) aims to deliver tumoricidal dose to clinical target volume (CTV) while sparing organs at risk (OAR), for which proton and photon beams are naturally complementary to each other: protons are generally better for OAR sparing, while photons are more robust to delivery uncertainties for CTV coverage. The hybrid proton-photon RT has a long history. However, as it generates proton and photon plans separately without fully utilizing joint proton-photon optimization during the planning stage, current hybrid RT is pseudo- hybrid and very limited in plan quality, treatment sites, and broad applicability. The key to leapfrog from pseudo-hybrid to truly-hybrid RT is new joint proton-photon optimization method that synergizes complementary proton and photon beams. The hypothesis is that truly-hybrid RT via appropriate joint proton- photon optimization will be more favorable than proton or photon-only RT, in terms of CTV coverage robustness and OAR sparing optimality.  Broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT to patients: (A) Clinical applicability: unlike pseudo-hybrid RT that is limited in plan quality and treatment sites, truly-hybrid RT may become a new paradigm for general cancer RT, owing to its superior plan quality and thus potentially clinical outcomes to proton-only or photon-only RT. (B) Clinical workflow: our truly-hybrid plans can be individually and safely delivered on existing proton and photon machines, and this effort envisions patients being treated in an integrated cancer center like ours with both proton and photon equipment, under the direction of a single physician, using shared immobilization devices, simulation procedure and structure set, and integrated treatment planning and delivery system. (C) Patient coverage: truly-hybrid RT can be made broadly available to many cancer patients through existing infrastructures in US, since (1) most hospitals with proton centers also have photon centers; (2) 76% of cancer patients live in the states with operational proton centers, while 85% are within 100-mile (2-hour-driving) distances to these proton centers; (3) cancer patients are more willing to travel for advanced treatment options.  Proposed effort: Inspired by unprecedented plan quality and broad applicability of truly-hybrid RT via our joint proton-photon optimization method, the next step is to test the hypothesis prospectively via clinical trials. However, a missing prerequisite to advance truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic is a treatment planning system (TPS) that can generate clinically-deliverable hybrid plans. To meet this urgent need, this effort will develop novel optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT, which is a radical step towards prospective clinical trials for testing the hypothesis.  Aim 1: Optimization methods and TPS for clinically-deliverable truly-hybrid RT.  Aim 2: Optimization methods for accurate and efficient MCO truly-hybrid planning.  Aim 3: Deep learning based optimization methods for efficient truly-hybrid planning. Project Narrative  This project will develop truly-”2D” proton-photon joint optimization methods for clinically-deliverable truly- hybrid RT with unprecedented superior plan quality to proton-only and photon-only RT, and first-of-its-kind TPS to bridge truly-hybrid RT from research to clinic. This hybrid TPS can facilitate prospective clinical trials of a broad spectrum of treatment sites for many patients. If succeed, truly-hybrid RT via this first-of-its-kind TPS will likely warrant improved clinical outcomes with reduced OAR toxicities, and potentially become a new paradigm for cancer RT in general, with compelling benefits in both treatment cost and clinical outcomes.",Novel Optimization Methods and Treatment Planning System for Clinically-Deliverable Truly-Hybrid Proton-Photon Radiotherapy,10207870,R37CA250921,"['Automobile Driving', 'Bathing', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Equipment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Immobilization', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiotherapy Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Travel', 'Treatment Cost', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'clinical application', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'treatment site']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,356850
