"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,9767751,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Facebook', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2019,204981,0.11645012974896299
"Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design Project Summary/Abstract The next generation of bioengineering and biomedical researchers will have unprecedented access to technologies including wireless health, big data, genetic sequencing, and machine learning approaches to enable modern diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. This presents individuals trained at the interface of technology and biomedicine with an enormous opportunity to address the world’s needs in health and medicine. In the Bioengineering Department at the University of California, Los Angeles, we aim to develop students into leaders able to seamlessly identify clinical needs that technology can address, design and validate solutions that address these needs, communicate with a variety of stakeholders to build teams invested in problem-oriented solutions, and to navigate the regulatory and commercial pathways necessary to enable their technologies to thrive. The Bioengineering Capstone Series at UCLA leverages resources available at UCLA to enable students to: 1) gain insight into clinical needs directly from clinicians and educators across the Ronald Reagan Medical Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, School of Dentistry and UCLA Health System, 2) design their solutions through mentorship from engineering professors, 3) understand the complexities of the biomedical industry with support from the UCLA Technology Development Group and members of the Department of Engineering Industry Advisory Board, 4) utilize modern technologies in wireless health and data science by collaborating with the Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data- to-Knowledge (MD2K) and Mobile Health (mHealth) Institute at UCLA, and 5) work with the National Science Foundation Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations Engineering Research Center (NSF PATHS- UP ERC) to learn to target and communicate their technologies to maximize societal benefits. Statement of Public Health Relevance: To prepare the next generation of engineers with skills in the design of therapeutics and medical devices, this research education program will provide bioengineering students at UCLA with enhanced opportunities to engage in real world design for biomedical applications. We will guide students through the medical design process from identifying needs, creating solutions which address these needs, and communicating the significance of their contributions to the greater community, ultimately yielding a larger pool of well-trained engineers to address biomedical challenges. !",Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design,9709138,R25EB027626,"['Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Technology', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High School Student', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intellectual Property', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modernization', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'STEM field', 'School Dentistry', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education research', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'lectures', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'product development', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'skills', 'technology development', 'undergraduate student']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R25,2019,21600,0.06325156533624388
"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,9763514,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2019,305372,0.15485646855788457
"Conference on Modern Challenges in Imaging in the Footsteps of Allan Cormack Project Summary: Tufts University physics professor Allan Cormack pioneered the field of tomography. His seminal work, from 1963 and 1964, provided both the mathematical foundations of computerized tomography (CT), and tangible proof-of-concept by engineering a rudimentary CT scanner. Taken together, this effort represented the first practical method to ""see into"" an object without physically breaking it open. Along with the engineer Godfrey Hounsfield, he won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for these contributions. Since then, tomography has broadened to include a wide range of modalities and problems. This field is unique for the rich interplay among applications in medicine, security, earth sciences, industry, physics, and the mathematics required to solve these problems. This international conference at Tufts, “Modern Challenges in Imaging: In the Footsteps of Allan Cormack” will honor the achievements of Cormack and reflect this diversity in the field by gathering top international researchers in mathematics, engineering, science, and medicine to communicate the most current research and challenges in the field. This will include work on mathematical models of emerging modalities, tomographic machine learning, dynamic methods, and spectral imaging with applications include medicine and security. The best research from the conference will be disseminated in a special issue of the journal Inverse Problems. Talks will be posted on the conference website. The organizers will recruit a diverse set of experienced participants and trainees, and the conference will be advertised in a range of publications reflecting the scientific and demographic diversity of the field. This conference is unique in that it combines high-level mathematical participants with experts in medical and industrial CT. It is structured to encourage participants from different fields to talk with each other, broaden their horizons, and make connections between problems and methodologies in the various fields. Several of the plenary talks will provide introductions to the areas. Trainees will be integrated into the conference through an informal welcome lunch and a poster session to introduce them to researchers in the field. This supports goals 1, 4, and 5, of the NIBIB: Researchers will present innovative biomedical technologies, engineering solutions, and mathematical methods to better image the body and objects more generally. The synergy between research areas will support the translation of technologies from the academic sphere to medical utility. The training opportunities for graduate students and beginners support the training of the next generation of diverse scientists. Project Narrative This conference will bring together medical, scientific, engineering, and applied mathematical researchers to present their newest research for a range of tomographic problems. Graduate students and beginners will be encouraged to participate and learn by being offered introductory talks, a student poster session, a welcome event, and an informal atmosphere. The conference will be structured so researchers will learn about important challenges in practical tomography as well as new techniques and methods, thereby creating synergies and research connections among the areas.",Conference on Modern Challenges in Imaging in the Footsteps of Allan Cormack,9837131,R13EB028700,"['Achievement', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Earth science', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fertilization', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'International', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lightning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Nobel Prize', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Seminal', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'higher level mathematics', 'informal atmosphere', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation', 'posters', 'professor', 'recruit', 'spectrograph', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'tomography', 'training opportunity', 'web site']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R13,2019,10000,0.03624702745625516
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program.

"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9852112,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,413898,0.22452394433660372
"CSHL Computational and Comparative Genomics Course The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory proposes to continue a course entitled “Computational and Comparative Genomics”, to be held in the Fall of 2017 – 2019. The Computational and Comparative Genomics course provides experimental biologists with backgrounds in molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry with the theoretical background and practical experience necessary to use and evaluate computational approaches to genome annotation and analysis, including protein sequence database searching, multiple sequence alignment, identification of promoters and other genetic regulatory elements, and the integration of sequence information into broader models of biological function. The course also provides computer scientists and mathematicians with an introduction to the algorithms, computational methods, and biological problems that are addressed in biological sequence analysis and computational biology. For post-doctoral fellows, and junior and senior investigators who are interested in changing their research direction towards computational biology, the course provides an introduction to computational biology methods and a survey of future directions. Over a seven day period, the students receive a strong grounding in the both the biological and computer science foundations for genome analysis and practical computer laboratory experience on challenging problems. The course is taught by internationally recognized leaders in the field, who provide hands-on demonstrations of the programs and biological databases that they have developed. At the end of the course, students can not only use effectively currently available tools in biological sequence analysis, they can also evaluate critically new computational approaches by considering alternative methods and interpretations, and appreciate the strengths and limitations of computational methods for answering broad biological questions. NARRATIVE The Computational & Comparative Genomics, a 9 day course, is designed to meet the continuing need for training in computational biology, statistics, and computer science for molecular biologists and geneticists with backgrounds in experimental biology. In addition, the course presents problems in biological sequence analysis and biological databases to biologists and computer scientists.

"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success.

"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: engaging and affordable robots with artificial software brains based on the latest neuroscience research. The robots and associated lesson plans will enable students to learn neuroscience by creating artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. By giving teachers and students access to neurorobotic technologies previously only available in research labs, we aim to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians.",Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots,9763674,R43NS108850,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cellular Phone', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Future Teacher', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Next Generation Science Standards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain tract', 'commercialization', 'computational reasoning', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'gaze', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'preference', 'project-based learning', 'science education', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'teacher', 'tool', 'twelfth grade']",NINDS,"BACKYARD BRAINS, INC.",R43,2019,312460,0.14449054179985193
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,9838650,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2019,225000,0.10111836596448032
"Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration There is an enormous deficit in students’ understanding of fractions in the United States. Fifth grade fraction knowledge predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Therefore, addressing this deficit is a particularly important area for early intervention. With this Fast-Track grant, Deep Fractions Learning , we propose to transform the way in which students learn core math curriculum so that materials are more interactive and engaging, promote deeper learning of content, and are aligned with the Common Core. More specifically, we will develop and evaluate a digital curriculum for grades 3-5 covering the fractions domain that combines games, collaboration, and an inquiry approach. We propose to develop an innovative technology infrastructure that will integrate Teachley learning games, Success for All’s (SFA) cooperative learning framework, and rigorous lesson content. We will integrate research into the design process and work with Johns Hopkins University to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Outcomes. The intervention will encourage four direct outcomes for students, namely improved: 1) conceptual understanding of fractions, 2) procedural fluency with fractions operations, 3) mathematical justification, and 4) motivation. First, the curriculum will build both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency, providing strong visual models within engaging games that motivate students to practice. The collaborative learning model and inquiry approach will improve students’ mathematical justification. Finally, we encourage these outcomes within a motivational support structure designed to foster engagement and self-efficacy. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in the area of fractions during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since each additional math class students complete in high school more than doubles the odds of college completion (Adelman, 2006), the intervention has the potential to make a real difference in whether students achieve sustainable careers versus being stuck in low-wage jobs. Fractions knowledge in the fifth grade strongly predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Intervention in this essential content area will improve students’ math ability in the short and long term, which in turn will lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as greater high school graduation rates and college attendance.","Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration",9789518,R44GM130162,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Common Core', 'Control Groups', 'Demographic Factors', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graduation Rates', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Mathematics Curriculum', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Wages', 'Work', 'boys', 'career', 'college', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'girls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mathematical ability', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reading ability', 'success', 'teacher', 'third grade', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,463456,0.1567821884453103
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). Significance: Education in clinical settings is often challenging, infeasible, risky, difficult to organize, time-consuming, and expensive. Due to these barriers, the value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, the purpose of mannequin use in education is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, physical mannequins have several fundamental limitations that do not allow them to demonstrate the many unique phases and expressions of a disease or person-to-person differences in anatomy and physiology. This limits the ability for a learner to view dynamic changes over time and to explore disease progression and consequences of interventions. Hypothesis: This research hypothesizes that existing, current mannequins can be enhanced through an innovative and practical Augmented Reality solution. In the Phase I effort a prototype system and sample educational material covering Pressure Ulcer care was developed and analyzed through pilot studies with Nursing educators, Doctoral Degree in Nursing (DNP) students, and pre-licensure students. The pilot results of the technology demonstrated a high degree of positivity and exceptional enthusiasm and all Phase I metrics of success were met or exceeded. Specific Aims: In Phase II the following aims are proposed: 1) Design a comprehensive suite of course content and design the technology's integration into a College of Nursing course, 2) Develop a production-ready system, and 3) Validate the system utility through human subject testing and expert evaluation of the system. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will open new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education. 3T",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9778054,R44AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Course Content', 'Decubitus ulcer', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensure', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Nursing Schools', 'Nursing Students', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'college', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'impression', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'miniaturize', 'person centered', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'teacher', 'virtual']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2019,779815,0.040402346088514195
"Medical Image Perception Society XVIII Conference MIPS XVIII brings together an international community of experts including radiologists, pathologists, other image-based clinicians, psychologists, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists investigating the extraction of diagnostic information from medical images. The meeting forges research and learning opportunities for new students and young researchers in a dedicated forum unmatched by other meetings. MIPS XVIII is being organized by the Medical Image Perception Society (a US-based society; Elizabeth Krupinski, PhD President) in conjunction with local hosts Trafton Drew, PhD (University of Utah Psychology) and William Auffermann, MD, PhD (University of Utah Radiology); and committee Lauren Williams (University of Utah) trainee member, David Alonso trainee member (University of Utah). It will run July 14-17, 2019 at the University of Utah Guest House & Conference Center located near the University of Utah campus. Nine topic areas have been selected for MIPS XVIII, reflecting important dimensions of medical image interpretation. This year’s special focus theme is addressing other image-based specialties outside radiology. Studying how clinicians extract diagnostic information from images identifies the causes of missed diagnoses and ways to eliminate these errors. Careful design and evaluation of imaging systems are critical in view of their enormous costs. With the current emphasis in the practice of medicine on “meaningful use” and “accountable care” to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care, the role the clinician as decision-maker cannot be ignored. Medical image perception research develops and applies modern methods to the evaluation of observer performance in diagnostic imaging tasks. Understanding basic aspects of the perception of medical images can reduce diagnostic error and improve medical decision-making quality. This grant will support 10 students to attend and present their research at MIPS XVIII. To date, 115 students have been awarded scholarships. The primary goal in supporting these students is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success. The meeting brings together researchers investigating the process of extracting diagnostic information from medical images to render accurate and efficient diagnostic decisions. Opportunities for advanced, interdisciplinary training of young scientists interested in medical image perception research and its relevance to disease prevention and treatment are often quite limited at the university level. Since 1997, 115 students have been awarded MIPS scholarships, having a significant impact on the field by creating opportunities and offering supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their research potential and likelihood of success as independent basic science and clinician-scientist researchers.",Medical Image Perception Society XVIII Conference,9833051,R13EB028683,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malpractice', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Modernization', 'Ophthalmology', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physician&apos', 's Role', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Scholarship', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'automobile accident', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'health care quality', 'image processing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'radiologist', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'whole slide imaging']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,10000,0.04812984517062218
"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9778578,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2019,225000,0.2214520925415344
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side.

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,9548637,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2018,305372,0.15485646855788457
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This program focuses on the development and dissemination of online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health.

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II Project Summary Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Clinical performance assessment emphasizes learner evaluation over learner development, lacks rigor and utility for developmental purposes, and clinical teachers have expressed particular difficulty with diagnosing reasoning deficits for remediation purposes. Further, medical students' diagnostic reasoning does not improve over the course of clinical training and senior medical students have highly variable diagnostic performance that is often rated below expectations according to theory-based and validated scoring criteria. Independent practice does not necessarily enhance the context for clinical reasoning; the majority of physicians' medical errors are thought to be diagnostic in nature. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Improve reliability of human scoring of DXJ essays. 2) Extend the automated scoring algorithms. 3) Automated reasoning failure categorization and remediation. 4) Complete the software development required for delivering the commercial product. 5) Evaluate predictive validity of automatically scored DXJ essays. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine. Project Narrative Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.","Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II",9537633,R42GM108104,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Case Based Learning', 'Case Study', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Community Health Education', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Teaching Method', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'educational atmosphere', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'software development', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'undergraduate medical education', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R42,2018,489952,0.09341053636112788
"MICCAI 2018 - 21th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Project Summary The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation, facilitation of research and education in the fields of medical image computing (MIC) and computer assisted interventions (CAI) including biomedical imaging and robotics; this is achieved through the organization and operation of regular international conferences of highest quality and publications which promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience in the field produced by leading institutions and outstanding scientists, physicians, and educators around the world. MICCAI Conferences have their roots and origin in three separate but related conferences beginning in early 1990s, the Visualization in Biomedical Computing (VBC), Computer Vision and Virtual Reality in Robotics and Medicine (CVRMed), and Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery (MRCAS), which merged into a single annual conference in 1998. MICCAI Conferences have defined a new scientific discipline over the years and have become the premier conference in the field with their proceedings having an impact factor comparable to high-impact computational journals. Conference topics include, computer vision & image processing for medical imaging, computer-aided diagnosis, computer-assisted intervention & surgery, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality, bioscience and biology applications, specific imaging systems and new biomedical imaging applications, spanning disciplines such as radiology, pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry. The main MICCAI conference includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. The quality and importance of poster presentations are considered to be on a par with those of oral presentations, with both undergoing a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance) and several presented papers becoming landmark publications over the years reaching up to 2,000 citations. The conference series includes community-driven software challenges, workshops and tutorials just before and/or after the main conference. These satellite events focus in detail on the current status and advances in topics relevant to MICCAI and are very highly attended. The MICCAI Conferences span the entire globe and are usually rotated among the American, European, and Asian continents. Attendance typically includes more than 45 countries, with strong student representation (~40%). The MICCAI 2018 Conference will be held in Granada, Spain in September 16th-20th, 2018. An innovative aspect of MICCAI 2018 is the initiation of a “Mentoring Program” to connect students and young investigators with established mentors from academia and industry. Along with the mission of “Women in MICCAI” committee, this proposal requests funds to initiate and ultimately sustain student travel awards to specifically enhance diversity in conference attendance, including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, to present their work, providing them with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations. Project Narrative The MICCAI 2018 Conference will be held in Granada, Spain during September 16th-20th, 2018.

"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the LSUHSC-NO PREP is to prepare individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who have recently completed their baccalaureate science degrees, for successful enrollment, retention, and completion of a PhD or MD-PhD training program. We aim to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by preparing PREP Scholars for the rigors and challenges of a biomedical doctoral degree program so that they will successfully obtain a PhD degree or MD/PhD degree and contribute their expertise to the biomedical scientific community.",LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences,9566214,R25GM121189,"['Academic Training', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Cities', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data Analyses', 'Degree program', 'Dentistry', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Extramural Activities', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Historically Black Colleges and Universities', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Louisiana', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Enrollment', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Oral', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Study Skills', 'Sum', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'education research', 'experience', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'gulf coast', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'member', 'minority communities', 'novel', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'recruit', 'role model', 'science education', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student', 'university student']",NIGMS,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R25,2018,235732,0.11781635253440027
"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: engaging and affordable robots with artificial software brains based on the latest neuroscience research. The robots and associated lesson plans will enable students to learn neuroscience by creating artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. By giving teachers and students access to neurorobotic technologies previously only available in research labs, we aim to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians.",Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots,9622419,R43NS108850,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cellular Phone', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Future Teacher', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Next Generation Science Standards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain tract', 'commercialization', 'computational reasoning', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'gaze', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'preference', 'project-based learning', 'science education', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'teacher', 'tool', 'twelfth grade']",NINDS,"BACKYARD BRAINS, INC.",R43,2018,386013,0.14449054179985193
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,9215686,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'student training', 'teaching assistant', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2017,59383,0.11460327072299134
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,9346652,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2017,204981,0.11645012974896299
"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,9349475,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2017,305372,0.15485646855788457
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This program focuses on the development and dissemination of online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to Washington State University faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies.

"CSHL Computational and Comparative Genomics Course The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory proposes to continue a course entitled “Computational and Comparative Genomics”, to be held in the Fall of 2017 – 2019. The Computational and Comparative Genomics course provides experimental biologists with backgrounds in molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry with the theoretical background and practical experience necessary to use and evaluate computational approaches to genome annotation and analysis, including protein sequence database searching, multiple sequence alignment, identification of promoters and other genetic regulatory elements, and the integration of sequence information into broader models of biological function. The course also provides computer scientists and mathematicians with an introduction to the algorithms, computational methods, and biological problems that are addressed in biological sequence analysis and computational biology. For post-doctoral fellows, and junior and senior investigators who are interested in changing their research direction towards computational biology, the course provides an introduction to computational biology methods and a survey of future directions. Over a seven day period, the students receive a strong grounding in the both the biological and computer science foundations for genome analysis and practical computer laboratory experience on challenging problems. The course is taught by internationally recognized leaders in the field, who provide hands-on demonstrations of the programs and biological databases that they have developed. At the end of the course, students can not only use effectively currently available tools in biological sequence analysis, they can also evaluate critically new computational approaches by considering alternative methods and interpretations, and appreciate the strengths and limitations of computational methods for answering broad biological questions. NARRATIVE The Computational & Comparative Genomics, a 9 day course, is designed to meet the continuing need for training in computational biology, statistics, and computer science for molecular biologists and geneticists with backgrounds in experimental biology. In addition, the course presents problems in biological sequence analysis and biological databases to biologists and computer scientists.

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II Project Summary Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Clinical performance assessment emphasizes learner evaluation over learner development, lacks rigor and utility for developmental purposes, and clinical teachers have expressed particular difficulty with diagnosing reasoning deficits for remediation purposes. Further, medical students' diagnostic reasoning does not improve over the course of clinical training and senior medical students have highly variable diagnostic performance that is often rated below expectations according to theory-based and validated scoring criteria. Independent practice does not necessarily enhance the context for clinical reasoning; the majority of physicians' medical errors are thought to be diagnostic in nature. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Improve reliability of human scoring of DXJ essays. 2) Extend the automated scoring algorithms. 3) Automated reasoning failure categorization and remediation. 4) Complete the software development required for delivering the commercial product. 5) Evaluate predictive validity of automatically scored DXJ essays. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine. Project Narrative Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.","Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II",9339455,R42GM108104,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Case Based Learning', 'Case Study', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Community Health Education', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Teaching Method', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'educational atmosphere', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'software development', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'undergraduate medical education', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R42,2017,500000,0.09341053636112788
"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the LSUHSC-NO PREP is to prepare individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who have recently completed their baccalaureate science degrees, for successful enrollment, retention, and completion of a PhD or MD-PhD training program.

"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract The value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, their primary purpose is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, they have several fundamental limitations. Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). This Phase I project will focus on creating and evaluating a proof of concept system. An engaging, interactive training course using the prototype system will be developed as a case study for clinical nursing training on pressure injuries – an oftentimes preventable injury that is attributed to tremendous human suffering and represents a significant cost burden on our health care system. The course will leverage existing mannequin-based training used at the UMN and be evaluated by both instructors and students at the School of Nursing. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will opens new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education.",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9409513,R43AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Schools', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Support Groups', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human study', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'pressure', 'professor', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'teacher', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R43,2017,224952,0.01564068279075378
"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,9021663,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'exercise program', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'student training', 'teaching assistant', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2016,59383,0.11460327072299134
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The  Training  Program  in  Computational  Neuroscience  (TPCN)  will  support  integrated   undergraduate  and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted  by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of  Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of  Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is  one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a  Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has  hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS  established an undergraduate major in  neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now  has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and  the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the  neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As  NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS   and  the  School  of  Medicine),  this training grant will ensure that computational modeling,  which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate  program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to  Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with  these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques  for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed  training  program will support coherent undergraduate  and  graduate  training  in   computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship  methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human  factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers.  (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed  specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose  innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit  modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees  for jobs not only in academia, but  also  in  medical  and  industry research. To achieve this, we  will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational  neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have  complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in  mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry.  Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders.

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,9322706,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Camping', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2016,316840,0.15485646855788457

"The q-bio Summer School DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology.

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current approaches to medical education produce new physicians with insufficient clinical competency to practice effectively with limited supervision, which has serious implications for patient outcomes during hospital off hours. Up to 70% of patients admitted to a hospital are admitted on nights or weekends, when staffing is low and residents may be in charge of patient care. Off-hours care is linked to an increase in medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates. Negative patient outcomes during off hours are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of residents in their first postgraduate year. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Develop a scoring algorithm that automatically evaluates students' written justifications of diagnostic strategy. 2) Build a taxonomy of strategy failures from students' diagnostic justifications. 3) Work closely with SIUSOM and other medical schools contemplating the addition of diagnostic reasoning assessment to their curriculum. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 4) Develop an application based on the Phase I proof of concept with refined algorithms for scoring, categorizing reasoning failures and targeted remediation. 5) Evaluate the learning application for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a limited field trial with students at SIUSOM. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During hospital off hours negative patient outcomes including medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of first year residents. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.            ",Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition,8703305,R41GM108104,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Residencies', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'case-based', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical malpractice', 'medical schools', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'theories', 'undergraduate medical education', 'usability']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R41,2014,144721,0.07924516475644489

All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems. The complexity and importance of these systems, which govern cellular activities and fates, provides motivation for developing a scientific and engineering workforce equipped to deal with the complexity.            ",The q-bio Summer School,8643269,R25GM105608,"['Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Qualifying', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biochemical model', 'biological research', 'career', 'career development', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'demographics', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'interest', 'lecture notes', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'peer', 'physical science', 'posters', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,"NEW MEXICO CONSORTIUM, INC.",R25,2014,171217,0.163415085726366
"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. !         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.             ",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8414506,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2013,59383,0.11460327072299134
"The q-bio Summer School     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers.

"ISMB 2012 Conference Support for Students & Young Scientists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2012 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in will be held in Long Beach, California, with 1,500-1,700 attendees, including 33-38% students/post doctoral researchers. ISMB brings together graduate students, post doctoral researchers, faculty, research staff and senior scientists of many different nationalities, all of whom are studying or working in computer science, molecular biology, mathematics or statistics. The conference brings biologists and computational scientists together to focus on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on ""intelligent systems"" and actual biological data makes ISMB a highly relevant meeting, and many years of producing the event has resulted in a professionally organized and respected annual conference. The ISMB conference presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences, including advances in sequencing genomes that may lead to a better understanding of how, for instance, cells interact for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Presentations may describe methods and advances associated with the analysis of existing biological literature, including benchmarking experiments, to create a better public understanding of scientific research reports. Overall, ISMB serves to educate attendees on the latest developments that will further drive the research methods and results of the field of computational biology. Students and scientists are able to return to their labs to appy what they have learned as they advance their own research efforts or begin investigating new areas they were exposed to as a result of attending ISMB. The scientific program for each ISMB meeting includes parallel presentation tracks of original research papers, highlights of recently published papers, special sessions focused on emerging topics, technology demos, late breaking research and poster presentations, an art in science exhibition, tutorial workshops, special interest group meetings and a student symposium organized by and for students. For ISMB 2011, 258 original research papers were submitted and 48 selected for the Proceedings Track, while 88 previously published papers were submitted and 38 selected for the Highlights Track. In all, over 225 talks were presented during the course of the 2011 conference, and similar numbers are anticipated for 2012. In all cases, submissions are rigorously reviewed, typically by three members of each track's committee before approval by the track chair, insuring the highest possible quality of work is presented. The specific areas represented in the conference vary each year depending on the areas that researchers find most interesting and innovative, and therefore submit as papers and proposals. This proposal seeks funding to assist students and junior researchers in attending the conference, thus exposing them to the latest research of their own areas as well as areas that may be new to them.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems, largely driven by genomic sequence efforts due to the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it.

"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal focuses on the development of accessible artificial intelligence (AI) software for individualized tutoring and formative assessment in chemistry education. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the very first AI tutoring systems for chemistry that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. An AI tutoring methodology formulated with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. Furthermore, classroom teachers can obtain individualized assessment reporting and diagnostic information for visually impaired students on demand, as if from a ""virtual teaching assistant"". Feasibility of Phase I was demonstrated by developing a prototype accessible AI tutoring program that received certification in the National Federation of the Blind's (NFB) Nonvisual Accessibility Web Application Certification Program. In previous SBIR projects, Quantum has successfully innovated new concepts in the field of AI and has developed, tested and brought to the classroom tutoring and assessment systems for science and mathematics education. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with other print-related disabilities, using Internet- capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation is the development of the first advanced AI chemistry tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. Important Phase II objectives include:  Continued progress on chemistry-specific accessibility issues. Completion of full accessibility support in AI framework itself. Implementation of Braille support for chemical formulas and equations. Investigation of chemistry-specific pedagogical issues for blind students. Extension to accessible science assessment for blind/VI students, building on AI assessment technology currently under development by Quantum in other projects. Special education is a particular challenge for assessment within the No Child Left Behind legislation. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum has long-term partnerships with McGraw-Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as two additional commercial agreements with major science education supply companies, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories and Sargent-Welch. Chemistry comprises the majority of the content standard for physical science in the National Science Education Standards, and yet is one of the most neglected areas in terms of quality educational software, in general, and is a particularly acute problem for the blind and visually impaired. Through recent federally-supported research, Quantum Simulations, Inc. has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the very first artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring systems for chemistry. The goal of the present research is to bring the full power and benefit of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired using Internet-capable screen access technology.          n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR),7404392,R44EY016251,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Categories', 'Certification', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Purpose', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Special Education', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Students', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'blind', 'braille', 'commercialization', 'concept', 'design', 'disability', 'falls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'physical science', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'science education', 'simulation', 'success', 'teacher', 'technological innovation', 'virtual']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R44,2008,383858,0.08722150130889468

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7389728,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2008,373102,0.2148898725261909
"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II proposal focuses on the development of accessible artificial intelligence (AI) software for individualized tutoring and formative assessment in chemistry education. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the very first AI tutoring systems for chemistry that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. An AI tutoring methodology formulated with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. Furthermore, classroom teachers can obtain individualized assessment reporting and diagnostic information for visually impaired students on demand, as if from a ""virtual teaching assistant"". Feasibility of Phase I was demonstrated by developing a prototype accessible AI tutoring program that received certification in the National Federation of the Blind's (NFB) Nonvisual Accessibility Web Application Certification Program. In previous SBIR projects, Quantum has successfully innovated new concepts in the field of AI and has developed, tested and brought to the classroom tutoring and assessment systems for science and mathematics education. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum AI Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind, as well as individuals with other print-related disabilities, using Internet- capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation is the development of the first advanced AI chemistry tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. Important Phase II objectives include:  Continued progress on chemistry-specific accessibility issues. Completion of full accessibility support in AI framework itself. Implementation of Braille support for chemical formulas and equations. Investigation of chemistry-specific pedagogical issues for blind students. Extension to accessible science assessment for blind/VI students, building on AI assessment technology currently under development by Quantum in other projects. Special education is a particular challenge for assessment within the No Child Left Behind legislation. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum has long-term partnerships with McGraw-Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as two additional commercial agreements with major science education supply companies, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories and Sargent-Welch. Chemistry comprises the majority of the content standard for physical science in the National Science Education Standards, and yet is one of the most neglected areas in terms of quality educational software, in general, and is a particularly acute problem for the blind and visually impaired. Through recent federally-supported research, Quantum Simulations, Inc. has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the very first artificial intelligence (AI) tutoring systems for chemistry. The goal of the present research is to bring the full power and benefit of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired using Internet-capable screen access technology.          n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software (Phase II SBIR),7220194,R44EY016251,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Categories', 'Certification', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Purpose', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Special Education', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Students', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'blind', 'braille', 'commercialization', 'concept', 'design', 'disability', 'falls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'physical science', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'science education', 'simulation', 'success', 'teacher', 'technological innovation', 'virtual']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R44,2007,366168,0.08722150130889468
"MUSC Minority Student Development Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goals of this program are to: 1) increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students choosing a research career in the biomedical sciences, 2) enhance the quantity and quality of URM students enrolled in the doctoral program in the College of Graduate Studies, 3) prepare them for a successful career in biomedical sciences, 4) provide structured activities that enhance the interaction of minority and majority students and 5) increase the number of URMs in the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP).

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7209749,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2007,430160,0.2148898725261909
"REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a summer program for undergraduates with non-biological sciences backgrounds that will provide cross-discipline training and experiences in combining the physical sciences backgrounds of the participants with concepts and approaches of functional genomics and cell biology to address biomedical research problems. The intended impact of our program is to encourage participating students to pursue graduate education in biomedical sciences, followed by careers in biomedical research.       Six students will be selected each year to pursue 10-week research experiences in one of eleven laboratories at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Instruction in functional genomics and cell biology will be provided through workshops and a series of seminars. Students will work as a group on a cross-discipline case study in wound-healing. In addition, students will receive instruction in research ethics, scientific writing, and career opportunities in biomedical sciences. At the conclusion of the summer, students will present their work at a poster session and receive evaluations. Students will be encouraged to publish their results in the Journal of the Ohio Association of Science.  To build community among these students, they will participate in a series of social and cultural events.   Formative evaluations will be used to alter and fine-tune the Program, and summative evaluations will be carried out at the conclusion of each summer and again, as the participants graduate from their undergraduate institutions, to measure the long-term impact of the Program on the participating students. n/a",REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology,7226706,R25GM072834,"['Academia', 'Academy',

"Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Precollege science education, particularly middle school where students first encounter courses dedicated to the sciences, has lacked the attention of the scientific and education communities. As a result, many middle level teachers are marginally prepared to teach contemporary science, the development of effective curricular materials has lagged, and schools devote inadequate resources and support to science. In the prior Phase I grant, experiment modules have been designed by scientists that address the core content of middle school Life Science. They utilize live (aquatic) organisms in the class room to stimulate inquiry into the properties of living organisms and make connections with related environmental health problems to link student learning with the world around them. Human environmental health was chosen as the biomedical context because it strongly relates to the macroscopic world in which middle school students live and provides age-appropriate learning opportunities for students as they begin to understand organisms and their underlying structures and mechanisms. During Phase II our specific objectives are 1. To infuse middle school Life Science education with attractive experiment modules that stress student inquiry. 2. To mount a comprehensive dissemination program with school systems that work with large numbers of minorities and students from families with lower socioeconomic status. 3. To utilize a 'train the trainer' method for lead teachers to achieve wide dissemination of the modules that involves close collaboration between scientists and educators and the lead teachers. 4. To provide teachers with full support to implement and sustain the modules through a science resource center. 5. To continue the development of the content of the modules. 6. To obtain a thorough formative and summative evaluation of the effectiveness of the curriculum modules and the entire mechanism for their delivery. 7. To establish a robust program to sustain the module dissemination to teachers after the completion of the grant.         n/a",Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII,6857683,R25RR014267,"['DVD /CD ROM', 'artificial intelligence', 'curriculum', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'ethnic group', 'female', 'learning', 'meeting /conference /symposium', 'minority health professional', 'science education', 'secondary schools', 'social support network', 'teacher', 'university student', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R25,2005,268813,0.12813827840576883
"LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stottler Henke Associates in collaboration with Teachers College, Columbia University, proposes to build a software system for teaching scientific inquiry in the context of nutrition science, The goal of the proposed research is to develop a computer based instructional system - called LiFESim - that teaches accurate and detailed information about food and the food system -- from production of food on the farm through food processing and transportation, to impacts of food on personal health and on the natural environment in terms of waste and pollution. The software will complement an existing health science curriculum, developed at Teachers College for 4th-6th graders, called ""Linking Food and the Environment"" or LIFE, developed from an NIH Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) RR 12374 (1997-2004). Our system will be based on the paradigm of role-playing simulation used in such popular computer games as SimCity and The Sims: students using the software assume roles in a simulated environment and learn from the consequences of the decisions that they make in those roles. Using the simulation paradigm students will be able to explore the dynamics of large-scale systems, such as those the food transportation system in ways that are not possible with the existing curriculum. For example, the simulation would allow students to explore the impact of changes in transportation patterns on food delivery. Our system will provide explicit coaching in applying scientific methods for investigation. We will also explore learning strategies that will encourage students to critically examine - and hopefully improve - their dietary choices. We will complement simulation-based learning with two other artificial intelligence based methodologies - the use of lifelike pedagogical agents, and the use of case-based reasoning. During Phase I, we will develop a set of detailed instructional goals, use these to develop an initial system design, develop a limited prototype of the system, and then develop and perform an informal pilot study to evaluate the viability of our design. The pilot study will be conducted over a one-month period at schools in Hayward, California and New York City. Our Phase II effort will focus on developing an extensive design and performing detailed use testing of the system developed during Phase I.         n/a",LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR),6790401,R43RR019780,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'environmental contamination', 'food', 'food processing /preparation', 'health education', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrition', 'nutrition related tag', 'science education']",NCRR,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2004,100000,0.09508078718515711
"AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR proposal is aimed at advancing the state of the art in chemistry education software in a critically important respect demanded by students, teachers, administrators and Quantum Simulations, Inc. customers. The focus of this innovation is the development of meaningful interactive tutoring and assessment capabilities for chemistry problem solving. Empowerment of students to make the proper decisions about drugs through experiencing the scientific process requires a solid education in basic chemistry. Chemical formulas comprise much of the fundamental ""language"" of chemistry in which students must be fluent in order to succeed. The topic of writing and understanding chemical formulas, a cornerstone of all general chemistry classes, is a reasonable starting point for the development of an AI assessment system for student learning in chemistry. A solid understanding of chemical formulas is a prerequisite to success in chemistry required not only for literacy to make informed decisions about drugs from a scientific standpoint, but also to enable and prepare students to pursue careers in research related to drug abuse. Quantum has already successfully developed and commercialized an ITS for writing chemical formulas which will be used as the starting point for the present work. The proposed technology will benefit all students; however, it is specifically targeted to help those who have the greatest need, such as students of average or marginal performance and students from historically underserved groups, by lowering barriers to accessing high-quality science instructional software.  Quantum customers include textbook publishers, software providers, hardware vendors and distance learning companies. A prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, has entered into two long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. Quantum intends to employ an identical business model to commercialize the results of this project. n/a",AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse,6831228,R43DA018455,"['adolescence (12-20)', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug abuse education', 'educational resource design /development', 'human subject', 'science education']",NIDA,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2004,61750,0.14259453411519107

"Educational Tools for Neuroscience   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SHAI proposes to bring two instructional        technologies together to compliment neuroscience lectures and distance               learning. Specifically we want to embed Computer Simulations of experiments and      the chemical, genetic, and physiological systems that underlie them within an        Intelligent Tutoring System. Simulations are excellent tools for revealing the       structure and dynamics of systems to students. They can also serve as a basis        of interactive experiments where students can ""discover"" the answers to              questions. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are an emerging educational            technology based on artificial intelligence research. They play the role of          tutor, in that they guide students with appropriate information or                   demonstrations when they are having difficulty with a lesson. They also              adaptively plan the presentation of new lessons based on evaluations of a            student's past performance and knowledge level. The objective of this phase I        proposal is to develop a prototype of NeuroTutor, a simulation-based ITS to          provide students with individualized instruction in a simulation centered            environment. Steps to reaching this objective include designing a curriculum,        developing instructional, presentations and support, developing appropriate          methods for Student Modeling and Diagnosis, and implementing a limited               prototype.                                                                           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  This project has a sizeable commercialization potential.  Medical schools and university  neuroscience courses from a significant market.  Moreover the technologies to be   developed are transferable to other domains in the natural and social sciences, business  and medicine.

"Optimizing the Utility of Large Electronic Health Records Data in Data-Driven Health Research Optimizing the Utility of Electronic Medical Records Data in  Data-driven Health Research ABSTRACT Medical centers continue to archive patient follow-up data in Electronic Medical Records (EMR), which have tremendous value in discovering new knowledge and insights. The large volume of EMR data can play an important role in improving the accuracy and generalizability of predictive models in healthcare, especially when misdiagnosis is known to be the third leading cause of death in the United States. Despite these merits, EMR data are invariably corrupted by factors like missing values, outliers, and unrealistic measurements, which prevent researchers from fully utilizing such abundant data in many important studies. Many studies simply discard a large number of samples to get rid of missingness and eventually bias their data-driven analytical models. Existing techniques for missing data imputation use simplified linear models and are mostly suitable for imputing cross-sectional data missingness that ignore longitudinal missingness in patient follow-up data. This proposal aims to investigate novel artificial intelligence (AI) based models to improve the quality and utility of EMR data in preparation for data-driven retrospective studies. Toward this preparation, the goal of the project is 1) to investigate more accurate and robust data imputation models compared to existing ones and 2) adapt state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in preparing optimal representation of large EMR data. The proposed research will 1) maximize the quality and utility of EMR data to support a multitude of retrospective studies, 2) enable visualization of complex patient data, 3) identify more important and predictive clinical parameters, 4) yield a compact and optimal representation of large EMR datasets. We hypothesize that optimally processed EMR data with state-of-the-art AI models can most accurately model patient risk when compared to existing statistical and clinical risk models. This project will combine the complementary expertise of the collaborators, Dr. Manar Samad, PhD (Computer Science), Dr. Owen Johnson, DPH (Biostatistics and Public Health), and Dr. Edilberto Raynes, MD, PhD (Medicine) along with the participating undergraduate students at Tennessee State University (TSU). The proposal entails several research and development components that will allow undergraduate students to gain valuable research and analytical skills in data science, programming, and health informatics. The project activities will expose health science students to AI-based computing solutions to broaden their scope of future health research and career. This project will help TSU prepare a strong workforce of minority students who will gain competitive skill sets in data science and health informatics that are currently high in demand almost everywhere. Overall, the project will develop a data-capable workforce to strengthen an interdisciplinary research capacity and collaboration between the Departments of Computer and Health science at TSU. Project Narrative Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data are invariably corrupted by data missingness and data redundancy that limit their application in many valuable data-driven research studies aiming to achieve the goals of precision medicine. This project aims to develop a number of innovative computational frameworks that will optimally prepare and utilize EMR data to facilitate research studies with relevance to patient risk modeling, discovery of new health markers, and patient-specific prognosis and therapeutic strategy. The project will leverage recent advances in machine learning and data science by involving an interdisciplinary team of researchers consisting of three faculty members, two graduate students, and four undergraduate students, which will establish a data-centric research collaboration between the Departments of Computer and Health Science.",Optimizing the Utility of Large Electronic Health Records Data in Data-Driven Health Research,10111205,R15LM013569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Tennessee', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'career', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'complex data ', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'data quality', 'data structure', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'minority student', 'neural network', 'non-linear transformation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'research study', 'skills', 'structured data', 'survival prediction', 'undergraduate student']",NLM,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2020,421700,0.047878939187214524
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,10002209,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Facebook', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2020,100690,0.11645012974896299
"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,10004013,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2020,239423,0.15485646855788457
"Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design Project Summary/Abstract The next generation of bioengineering and biomedical researchers will have unprecedented access to technologies including wireless health, big data, genetic sequencing, and machine learning approaches to enable modern diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. This presents individuals trained at the interface of technology and biomedicine with an enormous opportunity to address the world’s needs in health and medicine. In the Bioengineering Department at the University of California, Los Angeles, we aim to develop students into leaders able to seamlessly identify clinical needs that technology can address, design and validate solutions that address these needs, communicate with a variety of stakeholders to build teams invested in problem-oriented solutions, and to navigate the regulatory and commercial pathways necessary to enable their technologies to thrive. The Bioengineering Capstone Series at UCLA leverages resources available at UCLA to enable students to: 1) gain insight into clinical needs directly from clinicians and educators across the Ronald Reagan Medical Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, School of Dentistry and UCLA Health System, 2) design their solutions through mentorship from engineering professors, 3) understand the complexities of the biomedical industry with support from the UCLA Technology Development Group and members of the Department of Engineering Industry Advisory Board, 4) utilize modern technologies in wireless health and data science by collaborating with the Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data- to-Knowledge (MD2K) and Mobile Health (mHealth) Institute at UCLA, and 5) work with the National Science Foundation Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations Engineering Research Center (NSF PATHS- UP ERC) to learn to target and communicate their technologies to maximize societal benefits. Statement of Public Health Relevance: To prepare the next generation of engineers with skills in the design of therapeutics and medical devices, this research education program will provide bioengineering students at UCLA with enhanced opportunities to engage in real world design for biomedical applications. We will guide students through the medical design process from identifying needs, creating solutions which address these needs, and communicating the significance of their contributions to the greater community, ultimately yielding a larger pool of well-trained engineers to address biomedical challenges. !",Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design,9951056,R25EB027626,"['Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Technology', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High School Student', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intellectual Property', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modernization', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'STEM field', 'School Dentistry', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education research', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'lectures', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'product development', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'skills', 'technology development', 'undergraduate student']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R25,2020,21600,0.06325156533624388
"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9889974,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2020,575531,0.22452394433660372
"IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020 Project Summary This R13 application will provide travel support for competitively selected U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty to present their work at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020 to be held April 4-8, 2020 at the Coralville Marriott Hotel & Conference Center near the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa. ISBI is a scientific conference dedicated to mathematical, algorithmic, and computational aspects of biological and biomedical imaging, across all scales of observation (from microscopic to whole-body imaging) and is sponsored by both the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) and the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS). It attracts approximately 600-700 attendees each year involved in biomedical imaging research and development from academic institutions, government laboratories, and private companies. Since its inception in 2002, ISBI has become a leading international conference bringing together researchers from diverse algorithmic fields, applications, modalities, and size scales, to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of four-page papers which are peer-reviewed much like journal articles. In addition to oral and poster presentations of peer-reviewed papers in multiple tracks during the main conference, ISBI 2020 will also include special student events, tutorials, a “clinical day” emphasizing multi-disciplinary presentations/collaborations, plenary talks, workshops, and onsite grand challenges. Recipients of the travel awards will be competitively selected based on need and scientific excellence. U.S.- based students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty with accepted papers will be eligible to apply. We will be particularly supportive in providing travel awards to women and under-represented groups to help increase the diversity of the attendees. We anticipate that the travel awards will provide sufficient funding to the awardees to make the cost-benefit ratio for attendance extremely favorable. Through their attendance at ISBI, the awardees will benefit through their exposure to the simultaneous breadth and depth of topics offered at ISBI (presented by a mixture of leaders in the field as well as those early in their careers), their experience of presenting their work at an international conference, and their interactions and discussions with other attendees and leaders in the field. The conference as a whole will also benefit by not only enabling the high-quality work of the attendees to be presented but by also enabling an increased attendance of (and discussions/ideas/interactions with) U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty with diverse backgrounds. Project Narrative This application requests funds to provide travel support for students, postdoctoral fellows, and/or early- career faculty to attend and participate in the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020 conference, to be held at the Coralville Marriott Hotel & Conference Center near the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, April 4-8, 2020.

"Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Objectives: This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-18-835 to detect, engage, and experimentally evaluate the effects of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (e-CBT) to treat college students in two Latin American LMICs with major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder w/ or w/o comorbid common mental disorders (CMDs). Detection and engagement will be based on inexpensive internet-based self-report surveys and the intervention on inexpensive e-CBT to address the low resources in LMICs. Knowledge transfer to the primary LMIC collaborating institution (Mexican National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz [INPRFM]) will be a goal designed to facilitate dissemination to LMIC colleges/universities throughout Latin America. The study will build on prior research by collaborators in the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) survey consortium and WMH International College Study (WMH-ICS) initiative documenting high prevalence, impairment, and unmet need for treatment of CMDs among college students around the world and significant effects of e-CBT in treating these disorders in high income countries. Specific aims/Design/Methods: First, we will carry out a pragmatic clinical trial with students seeking treatment for CMDs at student clinics in four universities in Colombia and Mexico. Students on waitlists for student clinic services will be offered a possibility of receiving guided e-CBT immediately while staying on the list. 50% of the students with CMD who express interest will be randomized to guided e-CBT and the other 50% to treatment as usual (TAU). Short-term aggregate intervention effects will be assessed 60 days after randomization and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will then use ensemble machine learning methods to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of guided e-CBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict which students will respond best to which intervention. We will then implement a SMART design in which we randomize 50% to the treatment arm predicted to be optimal by the PTR and the other 50% to randomization across arms. Additionally, we will carry out annual WMH-ICS internet-based mental health needs assessment surveys with a probability sample of students to estimate unmet need for treatment and barriers to treatment. Students screening positive for CMD who are not in treatment and report resistance to in-person treatment will be randomized to guided e-CBT to determine if access to guided e-CBT reduces the unmet need for treatment among students with CMDs who fail to seek treatment at student health clinics. Finally, the technology for screening, delivering e-CBT, and updating the precision treatment model, implemented initially by Harvard Medical School, will be transferred to INPRFM for dissemination to universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. That many senior regional mental health policy makers are trained at INPRFM and return for periodic policy summits, coupled with the close working relationship of INPRFM with the Pan American Health Organization, bode well for such dissemination efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research will provide valuable information to school administrators and government policy makers in the participating LMICs to document the burden of CMDs among university students, the extent of unmet need for treatment of these disorders, the effectiveness of inexpensive-scalable e-CBT interventions to treat these disorders, and for whom e-CBT is most effective. The technology transfer part of the study will build capacity to disseminate the methods used for screening, targeting, and intervention implementation so that they can be used in colleges and universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. Such an effort could have enormous public health implications for the region and serve as a model of evidence-based intervention planning and implementation for other parts of the world.",Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs,10053143,R01MH120648,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cities', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Colombia', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latin America', 'Latin American', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Pan American Health Organization', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Probability Samples', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'arm', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'college', 'common treatment', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'nervous system disorder', 'outreach', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'symposium', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'undergraduate student', 'university student']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY,R01,2020,10000,0.08466308673140394
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10092402,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2020,830874,0.10111836596448032
"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). Significance: Education in clinical settings is often challenging, infeasible, risky, difficult to organize, time-consuming, and expensive. Due to these barriers, the value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, the purpose of mannequin use in education is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, physical mannequins have several fundamental limitations that do not allow them to demonstrate the many unique phases and expressions of a disease or person-to-person differences in anatomy and physiology. This limits the ability for a learner to view dynamic changes over time and to explore disease progression and consequences of interventions. Hypothesis: This research hypothesizes that existing, current mannequins can be enhanced through an innovative and practical Augmented Reality solution. In the Phase I effort a prototype system and sample educational material covering Pressure Ulcer care was developed and analyzed through pilot studies with Nursing educators, Doctoral Degree in Nursing (DNP) students, and pre-licensure students. The pilot results of the technology demonstrated a high degree of positivity and exceptional enthusiasm and all Phase I metrics of success were met or exceeded. Specific Aims: In Phase II the following aims are proposed: 1) Design a comprehensive suite of course content and design the technology's integration into a College of Nursing course, 2) Develop a production-ready system, and 3) Validate the system utility through human subject testing and expert evaluation of the system. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will open new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education. 3T",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9964623,R44AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Course Content', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensure', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Nursing Schools', 'Nursing Students', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'college', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'impression', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'miniaturize', 'person centered', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'teacher', 'virtual']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2020,688185,0.040402346088514195
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10006915,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,231500,0.2110788534852535
