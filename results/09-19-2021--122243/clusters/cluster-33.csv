"User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) systemfor robust upper limb prosthesis control ABSTRACT Approximately 41,000 individuals live with upper-limb loss (loss of at least one hand) in the US. Fortunately, prosthetic devices have advanced considerably in the past decades with the development of dexterous, anthropomorphic hands. However, potentially the most promising used control strategy, myoelectric control, lacks a correspondingly high-level of performance and hence the use of dexterous hands remains highly limited. The need for a complete overhaul in upper limb prosthesis control is well highlighted by the abandonment rates of myoelectric devices, which can reach up to 40% in the case of trans-humeral amputees. The area of research that has received the most focus over the past decade has been “pattern recognition,” which is a signal processing based control method that uses multi-channel surface electromyography as the control input. While pattern recognition provides intuitive operation of multiple prosthetic degrees of freedom, it lacks robustness and requires frequent, often daily calibration. Thus, it has not yet achieved the desired clinical acceptance. Our team proposes clinical translation of a novel highly adaptive upper limb prosthesis control system that incorporates two major advances: 1) machine learning (robust classification by implementing a non-boundary based algorithm), and 2) training by retrospectively incorporating user data from activities of daily living (ADL). The proposed system will enable machine intelligence with user input for prosthesis control. Our work is organized as follows: Phase I: (a) First, we will implement a fundamentally new machine intelligence technique, Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Sparse Representation Classification (EASRC), that is more resilient to untrained noisy conditions that users may encounter in the real-world and requires less data than traditional myoelectric signal processing. (b) In parallel, we will implement an adaptive learning algorithm, Nessa, which allows users to relabel misclassified data recorded during use and then update the EASRC classifier to adapt to any major extrinsic or intrinsic changes in the signals. Taken together, EASRC and Nessa comprise the Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system. Once, the RESCU implementation is complete, we will optimize the system through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University, and complete an iterative benchtop RESCU evaluation with a focus group of 3 amputee subjects and their prosthetists. Our milestones for Phase I are as follows:  Milestone 1.1: Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptively Sparse Representation (EASRC) algorithm  successfully implemented and verified  Milestone 1.2: Implementation of Nessa adaptive learning algorithm and smartwatch interface  Milestone 1.3: User Needs and Design Inputs locked as a result of Focus Group testing  Milestone 1.4: Hold a pre-submission meeting with FDA for feedback on device classification and  planned product performance testing  Milestone 1.5: Hold a Scientific Steering Group (SSG) meeting  Milestone 1.6: Convene a Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) and hold an initial meeting to review  clinical plans.  Milestone 1.7: Develop Clinical Study Protocol  Milestone 1.8: Register the study on www.clinicaltrials.gov. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we aim to empower the user by bringing them into the control loop of their prosthesis and improve the stability of their control strategy over time. Specifically, we implement to a robust classifier, an adaptive learning algorithm, and a smartwatch interface, which allows the user to teach their device when it misunderstands the commands that the user is sending to control the prosthesis. This will result in improved control without cumbersome or time-consuming effort on the part of the user and, more importantly, we hope that it will give the user a greater sense of empowerment and ownership over their prosthesis.",User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) systemfor robust upper limb prosthesis control,9779227,U44NS108894,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Calibration', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Freedom', 'Group Meetings', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Ownership', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'empowerment', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'myoelectric control', 'novel', 'operation', 'performance tests', 'prosthesis control', 'signal processing', 'smart watch']",NINDS,"INFINITE BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",U44,2019,79250,0.00013821006806188904

"Innovations in cervical cancer diagnosis for low resource settings using advanced optical imaging and machine learning diagnostic algorithms. The broad goal of this project is to adapt a portable, low-cost, easy-to-use Pocket-sized Colposcope (developed under other funding) for use in a community setting, and develop automated algorithms that combine neovascularization, glycogen depletion and acetowhitening to provide comparable diagnosis to an expert. This work will be done in a collaboration between 3rd Stone Design, Inc, Duke University and Kenya Medical Research Institute. The specific aims of this proposal are:  Aim 1 (Phase I): Improve Pocket colposcope by designing continuous magnification mechanism and improving device workflow integration to eliminate between-use disinfection through the use of a disposable optically clear sterile sleeve. Provider feedback on our previously developed Pocket colposcope has unanimously suggested the addition of a slider mechanism to control coarse zoom and a sleeve consumable to the Pocket colposcope design.  Aim 2 (Phase I): Automated algorithms and software for cervical pre-cancer detection We will improve the specificity of VIA using a novel software application with embedded machine learning diagnostic algorithms for automated cervical cancer screening. We will apply and validate the individual algorithms for VIA and GIVI (green illumination vascular imaging) to existing images obtained from a 200-patient clinical study with the Pocket colposcope. We will then compare the performance of the algorithms to expert physician interpretation of the same images, with pathology serving as the gold standard.  Aim 3 (Phase II): Document user experience with Pocket colposcope in Kenya. We will develop a culturally relevant training package directly in the community healthcare setting. We will collect quantitative and qualitative data including surveys, in-depth interviews, and clinic observations from both naive providers and patients and use these findings to and use these findings to improve the introduction of the Pocket colposcope in Kenya and simultaneously, inform the clinical investigations in Aim 4.  Aim 4 (Phase II): Compare the performance of the Pocket colposcope to Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid for triage of HPV+ women in Kenya. We will carry out a cluster-randomized trial among 400 HPV+ women to compare the standard triage with that using the Pocket colposcope in Kisumu, Kenya. All HPV+ women will undergo biopsy to determine sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of the different triage strategies. Data will be used to model the performance of the algorithm against that of expert colposcopists.  Aim 5 (Phase II): Assess the costs, incremental cost-effectiveness and population health impact of HPV-based cervical cancer screening programs with proposed triage strategies. We will determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the absolute and relative costs for four triage strategies by measuring the costs and model population health outcomes (cancer cases, deaths and disability adjusted life years). NARRATIVE The SBIR activities proposed by 3rd Stone Design and Duke University will advance the state of the art in cervical cancer imaging through the R&D of novel optics for a portable colposcope combined with automated algorithms for diagnosis. The project will confirm the benefits of these innovations through a clinical trial in Kenya conducted by the Kenya Medical Research Institutes. The innovations developed have tremendous potential to effect public health by increasing diagnostic acuity and decreasing costs of healthcare delivery which ultimately will reduce the impact of the deadly disease.",Innovations in cervical cancer diagnosis for low resource settings using advanced optical imaging and machine learning diagnostic algorithms.,9778122,R44CA240019,"['Acetic Acids', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Back', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Community Health', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Cost Analysis', 'Cost Measures', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disinfection', 'Feedback', 'Fogs', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Glycogen', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Interview', 'Kenya', 'Lesion', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Medical Research', 'Modeling', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sledding', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Sterility', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vagina', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness ratio', 'design', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'incremental cost-effectiveness', 'innovation', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mortality', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'overtreatment', 'point of care', 'population health', 'portability', 'primary care setting', 'relative cost', 'research and development', 'screening', 'screening program']",NCI,CALLA HEALTH FOUNDATION,R44,2019,299992,-0.016077594883930908
"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users. This project supports the NIH's stated mission of reducing disability by improving patient outcomes with new prosthetic and orthotic devices.",Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time,9668174,R03HD092639,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Electromyography', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prosthesis', 'Reference Values', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'functional restoration', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'light weight', 'neural network', 'novel', 'respiratory gas', 'robotic device', 'sensor', 'wearable device']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2019,78000,0.026668772794640045
"BlueBox: A Complete Code Blue Data Recorder, Phase II “Code blue” is the signal used in hospitals to call for an immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following a cardiac or respiratory arrest. Reviewing the performance of the “code blue team” is a cornerstone for improving outcomes. The current standard of using handwritten records on a paper “code sheet” does not allow measurement of key quality indicators and is subject to human error. In the Phase I STTR project, we developed an electronic device for complete recording of code blue events, called BlueBox. The BlueBox is a small electronic recorder on an adhesive patch to be placed on the left chest next to the mid-sternum. The prototype we developed in Phase I was successfully tested on high fidelity mannequins and on pigs. In Phase II, our goal is to complete the product development and testing and prepare the BlueBox for regulatory clearance and market launch. To achieve this goal, we propose 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to complete the product development of the BlueBox device and the software user interface (UI) for the “electronic code sheet.” We will turn the engineering prototype we developed in Phase I into a product ready for commercialization through rigorous product development processes. We will develop a mobile app for iPads with a software UI for the “electronic code sheet.” Aim 2 is to conduct human factors and usability engineering (HF/UE) testing and prepare for regulatory submission. The alpha prototype will undergo HF/UE testing in the Simulation Center. We will establish and maintain quality management records and conduct a pilot production run of 200 units of BlueBox. Aim 3 is to validate the BlueBox system in a clinical study of code blues in the hospital. We will first conduct a pilot study of 5 code blue patients in the CCU and Cath Lab. Once the pilot study is successful, we plan to conduct a full clinical study of 100 patients recruited from the Harbor-UCLA ICU/CCU and emergency departments. The objectives of the clinical study are: 1) to establish equivalence of the electronic code sheet to the current standard of paper code sheet; 2) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electronic code sheet in identifying key CPR quality indicators. The criteria for successful development of the product will be that it passes all required regulatory testing and is validated in the clinical study for its equivalence and effectiveness in code blue recording. There will be two major milestones in this project: (1) finalizing product development with successful test production of 200 units; and (2) completing the clinical study and preparing for a 510(k) submission. Achieving the aims will result in a validated BlueBox system ready for submission to the FDA and commercialization. We intend to first introduce the BlueBox system to hospitals as a tool for staff training and quality improvement. We will continue the technology development with machine learning to provide instant feedback in the second generation BlueBox. Our ultimate goal is to minimize human error and improve patient outcomes through the BlueBox system's better documentation and continuous feedback mechanism. PROJECT NARRATIVE Debriefings and detailed reviews of the performance of the “code blue team” in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can improve quality of care and patient outcomes. In Phase I, we developed and successfully tested an electronic device, the BlueBox, for recording all CPR events and enabling full displays of code blue resuscitations in an “electronic code sheet.” We will turn the engineering prototype into a product ready for regulatory submission and commercialization in the proposed Phase II project.","BlueBox: A Complete Code Blue Data Recorder, Phase II",9680137,R42GM113463,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adhesives', 'American Heart Association', 'Animals', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Code Blue', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Countershock', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Situation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Administrators', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Industrialization', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality Indicator', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sternum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validity and Reliability', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'commercialization', 'design', 'heart rhythm', 'human error', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile application', 'patient safety', 'product development', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'technology development', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"NEOVATIVE, INC.",R42,2019,723986,0.02437728084964093
"Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water PROJECT SUMMARY Detrimental health impacts of lead are largely attributed to long-term exposures to undetected lead, which are particularly troublesome and problematic because of the neurological damage to children, a situation that should not be tolerated by an advanced society like the U.S. The Flint Water Crisis and many other water catastrophes could have been avoided if early warning can be made possible through timely detection of lead in drinking water at the point of use. Our extensive customer interviews unambiguously suggest that current options for lead detection are unsatisfactory for on-site testing, as they represent two extremes: one being accurate but expensive, slow, and hard to use; and the other being low-cost, fast, and easy to use but inaccurate. NanoAffix Science LLC (NAFX) proposes to address the above unmet need and niche market product gap by empowering water users (particularly those in economically disadvantaged communities) and water service providers with a low-cost, easy-to-use, and accurate handheld tester for rapid detection of total lead in the tap water, right from the kitchen sink. The handheld lead tester combines a novel proprietary micro-sized sensor chip embedded in a proprietary test cell with a portable digital meter for direct readout of testing results. The Phase I project has successfully established the feasibility for detection of soluble lead in the tap water using an earlier version of the prototype handheld tester. The Phase II project will continue to develop the handheld tester toward total lead detection, better device uniformity, pilot scale-up manufacturing, and accurate calibration. At the end of the Phase II project, NAFX plans to produce 20 beta units of the handheld lead tester meeting all performance specifications for field validation by 10 initial customers (e.g., schools/daycares, end water users, and well water drillers). Major innovations of the proposed approach include accurate prediction of the particulate lead through partial digestion based on lead digestion kinetics, and strategic and synergistic improvement of the ultimate sensor prediction accuracy by (1) improving the physical sensor device uniformity (both intra-wafer and inter-wafer) through innovative device configuration and rigorous quality control; and (2) improving the calibration accuracy through innovative theoretical equilibrium chemistry modeling and machine learning data analytics. The NAFX handheld lead tester is the first of its kind to (1) offer all three features sought by customers: accurate, cheap, and fast; and (2) to simultaneously report all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead), which thus can not only alert customers to the lead hazard in their drinking water but also enable customers to identify possible causes and most effective solutions to mitigate the lead contamination. Therefore, the project will result in not only considerable economic impact but also immense societal impact. The regular use of NAFX handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NanoAffix Phase II project aims to continue the development of a handheld lead tester for accurate and low- cost onsite detection of total lead in tap water by untrained users, based on the success of the Phase I project. The project will contribute to enhancing the public health by offering an accessible tool for quantitative monitoring of all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead) in tap water. The regular use of NanoAffix handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk.","Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water",9847052,R44ES028656,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Calibration', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Disinfection', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'International', 'Interview', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lead Poisoning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'Wireless Technology', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'drinking water', 'economic impact', 'empowered', 'graphene', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lead concentration', 'lead contamination', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'meetings', 'meter', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'operation', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water quality', 'well water']",NIEHS,"NANOAFFIX SCIENCE, LLC",R44,2019,565059,0.021675687272268925
"I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia. 1. Executive Summary Nearly 150,000 patients in the US undergo lower extremity amputations annually secondary to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) complicated by critical limb ischemia (CLI).1,2,3 To increase a patient’s post-operative quality of life, surgeons attempt to salvage as much limb tissue as possible while also considering the likelihood of primary wound healing at a given level of amputation (LOA).4 The principal challenge in this decision is that surgeons overestimate the likelihood of healing at the selected LOA. Therefore, in the first year, 10% to 35% of amputations eventually require re-amputation to a more proximal level.5-7 This additional treatment prolongs the patient’s return to walking, worsening their condition and deteriorating their mental health. The burden to the healthcare system is immense. The average cost for each amputation is over $70,000, as evidenced by a recent publication that shows diabetic foot ulcer complications, mainly attributed to amputation, cost more than the five most costly forms of cancer.8 Despite these facts, there are no objective studies for selection of LOA in patients with PAD. To address this critical problem, Spectral MD (SMD) has developed a point-of-care imaging device (DeepView), which simultaneously performs multispectral imaging (MSI) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) imaging across the visible and infrared spectrum to obtain a quantitative microvascular tissue assessment. These optical measurements are integrated using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to provide a quantitative aid to the physician’s determination of tissue viability at a proposed amputation site. If used for routine assessment prior to amputation, SMD expects DeepView to reduce the rate of re- amputation by 70%, resulting in up to 38,000 fewer re-amputations per year while improving quality of life for amputees and reducing associated health costs. The central objective for SMD’s Phase I SBIR is to perform a feasibility clinical study to demonstrate the DeepView device will achieve greater than 90% accuracy in identifying the healing potential of tissue at the amputation site. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1: Complete a Feasibility Study creating a database of pre-amputation images. This data will be used for construction of the AI algorithm to predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 2: Identify MSI and PPG features that can accurately predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 3: Using Aim I clinical data, finalize the AI algorithm architecture and estimate sample size needed for a Phase II Pivotal Study in which the necessary training data to achieve at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity will be obtained. As of this Supplement request, SMD has initiated a clinical study for feasibility and enrolled the first subject. Through collaboration with the clinical study site Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Dennis Gable, SMD developed the protocol and trained his research staff at the study site, Baylor Medical Center Plano, in the use of the DeepView device. SMD anticipates enrollment of five subjects each month over the next 6 months. The I-Corps team will consist of the following members: Michael DiMaio, MD – Role: C-Level Corporate Officer. Dr. DiMaio, MD is Founder and Chief Executive Officer of SMD and has led SMD in obtaining over $30M in non-dilutive government funding and private investments. His distinguished career includes extensive experience as an entrepreneur, clinician, and scientist. With over 20 years’ experience as a cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. DiMaio has a widespread network of physicians and hospitals from which to draw contacts for customer interviews. Jeffrey Thatcher, PhD – Role: PI. Dr. Thatcher is the Chief Scientist at SMD and is a leader in the development of diagnostic imaging for soft tissue diseases. He led SMD in conceptualizing and inventing SMD’s core imaging technology undergoing clinical trials in three wound diagnostics applications including: burns; diabetic ulcers; and amputation. Wensheng Fan, MS – Role: Industry Expert. Wensheng Fan is Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at SMD. He is an executive, entrepreneur, and innovator with over 20 years of experience in natural speech recognition and real time imaging systems. At SMD, he leads market engagement, strategic financial planning, and device development. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia.,9827388,R43HL142428,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Burn injury', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic ulcer', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Innovation Corps', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Ischemia', 'Judgment', 'Knee', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Principal Investigator', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'S Phase', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Soft Tissue Disorder', 'Specificity', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Wound Healing', 'career', 'cost', 'experience', 'foot', 'healing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'point of care', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'speech recognition', 'wound']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2019,54976,-0.010692740069486659
"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback. The results of this project will provide preliminary data for a long-term, multicenter study that evaluates the benefits (improved quality of life, fewer strokes) and harms (increased treatment complications, increased cost) of consumer-driven AF detection. PROJECT NARRATIVE The consequence of mobile technologies marketed as medical devices are unknown, including devices that provide alerts for the presence of atrial fibrillation. The goal of this project is to evaluate the benefits and harm associated with consumer-driven atrial fibrillation detection.",Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection,9809717,R03HL148372,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Apple', 'Apple watch', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electric Countershock', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Infrastructure', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sales', 'Series', 'Sinus', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Visit', 'base', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'mobile computing', 'population based', 'routine screening', 'self diagnosis', 'smart watch', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2019,76250,0.02499558586702946
"Phase II - HazPrep Worker Training - Community Risk Profile PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A worker's personal hazard profile (PHP) is a function of hazards present and his/her exposure level to those hazards. Workers with an elevated level of risk are those who can be engaged in activities related to - or working around - hazardous materials, waste generation, removal, containment, transportation, and emergency response. inXsol’s Phase I feasibility study verified appeal and effectiveness of a new form of crowdsourced social learning platform. Our approach using cloud technology creates a dynamically growing library of incidents/scenarios, highly personalized (occupation/task/geo) risk profile and generates learning activities to train on risk awareness and mitigation techniques. The Phase II proposal includes implementation of an innovative use of big data algorithms for community profiles and fusion with PHP allowing for targeted and personalized training completing the HazPrep prototype developed and exercised by our beta test team in Phase I. PROJECT NARRATIVE HazPrep is a new form of a social learning platform which includes crowdsourcing and machine learning AI to formulate personalized learning activities at risk workers with an elevated level of risk such as those who can be engaged in activities related to - or working around - hazardous materials, waste generation, removal, containment, transportation, and emergency response.

"Expert Guiding Technology to Help Individuals with Developmental Challenges Build Life and Vocational Skills Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) remains the most effective and scientifically-validated approach to remediate the deficits due to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID). There are serious challenges in delivering effective ABA: unavailability of effective treatment in many places; high instructor turnover; loss of program fidelity due to complexity and instructor variability; onerous data collection that directs attention away from the learner; and the time sink of creating required reports and charts that steals time away from instructional activities. A software platform named GAINS (Guidance, Assessment and Information System) is being developed that uniquely incorporates artificial intelligence to overcome problems in delivering ABA. GAINS is powered by expert guiding software that incorporates knowledge of ABA practice and curricula personalized for the individual with developmental challenges. Like Google Maps that guides you step-by-step and updates as you go along, GAINS guides instructors and caregivers and adapts to client responses on the fly. In this way, expert guiding technology reduces a priori training requirements in ABA while providing real- time apprenticeship coaching to overcome variability in instructor experience and improve program fidelity. Improved program fidelity promotes better learning outcomes of individuals with ASD and ID. The project will evaluate and iteratively innovate expert guiding technology to support the powerful, but difficult to implement, ABA technique of Task Analysis (TA). There are two overarching aims: 1) conduct scientifically-valid, clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of expert guiding technology to support instructors to better help individuals with developmental challenges due to ASD and ID learn life and vocational skills and use the results in Phase I to develop larger, more comprehensive clinical trials to be conducted in Phase II; and 2) use clinical trials in Phase I and Phase II to more effectively identify and prioritize iterative innovations in expert guiding technology as part of successive Design Science Research Cycles. Single Case Research Designs (SCRD) will be used to evaluate expert guiding technology interventions to support Task Analysis. SCRDs are a viable alternative to large group studies such as randomized clinical trials. Single case studies involve repeated measures, and manipulation of an independent variable. SCRD studies allow for rigorous experimental evaluation of intervention effects and provide a strong basis for establishing causal inferences. Advances in design and analysis techniques for SCRD have made SCRD studies increasingly popular in educational and psychological research. Chimes Delaware will be the site for clinical trials. Chimes Delaware is one of the largest providers of community services for adults with intellectual, autism, and co-occurring disabilities. The project team has worked together for many years and is uniquely qualified. If successful, the increase of scientifically-validated technical capabilities of expert guiding technology will profoundly affect clinical practice. The clinical trials proposed in this project will provide new scientific knowledge on the efficacy of expert guiding technology to overcome problems in delivering quality ABA therapy. Iterative innovations of expert guiding technology will greatly increase the technical capabilities.

"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,9761481,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2019,873369,0.01122768962722258
"Enabling of a Wireless and Remotely Monitored Deep Brain Stimulation System through the Internet of Medical Things for Parkinson's Disease Patients Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless bidirectional real-time communication and powering of a Bilateral Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system with remote patient monitoring. DBS has become an established neurosurgical procedure with over 160,000 patients treated worldwide. DBS has been shown to improve Parkinson's disease (PD) patient quality of life, increase long term tremor control, reduce dyskinesia, and reduce hyperdopaminergic behavioral symptoms. Some of the most common complications associated with this procedure are injury caused by wire/lead tunneling, erosions or infections of the tunneled wires, lead failure/migration, and tethering of extension cables. None of the current solutions are leadless and allow for remote monitoring due to limitations of wireless interconnected devices in the body. Bionet Sonar's software-defined UsWB proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly higher than RF waves and with greater reliability. The Bionet platform includes: i) Reprogrammable wireless stimulation leads; ii) Rechargeable system controller to coordinate with, recharge, and reprogram other implantable elements of the network through the ultrasonic interface; iii) External recharging and communication patch to act as a power/data gateway to interconnect the intra-body network with the Internet. An intelligent DBS device that can be monitored by clinicians and provide feedback control to optimize therapy using remote continuous real-time data will lead to improved PD treatment options and informed treatment decisions individualized for each patient (point-of-care). In this Phase I study, feasibility for wireless power and remote monitoring with the Bionet system will be demonstrated by completing the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of controlled deep brain stimulation, recharging and remote monitoring components using ultrasonic waves at typical implantable tissue depths. Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate in vivo, data and energy transmission for the systems during controlled stimulation of the brain. In vivo experiments in minipig models (n=3) will be used to demonstrate the ability of the system to transmit data and energy from the subcutaneous controller to the pacing nodes using closed loop control based on real time electrical sensing. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet Sonar Inc. and the University of Louisville. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet Sonar system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a wireless remotely monitored deep brain stimulation system will be developed using new core technology for the Internet of Medical Things. Ultrasonic wideband technology will be used to enable wireless communication and recharging of the different implantable elements, allowing for miniaturization and energy efficiency. This technology will not only improve the outcomes and healthcare economics of the Parkinson's disease patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Enabling of a Wireless and Remotely Monitored Deep Brain Stimulation System through the Internet of Medical Things for Parkinson's Disease Patients,9908204,R43NS115226,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bilateral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cadaver', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dopa-Responsive Dystonia', 'Drops', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Essential Tremor', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Injury', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intrabody', 'Lead', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Manic', 'Medical', 'Miniature Swine', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurosurgical Procedures', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stomach', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Tremor', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonics', 'Universities', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'health care economics', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vitro Model', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'migration', 'monitoring device', 'multimodality', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized decision', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'point of care', 'preclinical efficacy', 'product development', 'radio frequency', 'safety testing', 'software development', 'sonar', 'subcutaneous', 'transmission process', 'treatment optimization', 'verification and validation', 'wireless communication']",NINDS,BIONET SONAR,R43,2019,328562,-0.04921939814977715
"Stasys Medical: A Rapid, Microfluidic Blood Test Sensitive to Platelet Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US. While monitoring platelet therapy is of increasing importance for the identification of hypo- or hyper-responsive patients, there is not a clear picture of the medical value of tailored antiplatelet therapy using currently available platelet function tests. Currently, US FDA cleared assays of platelet function designed to be near the patient measure platelet adhesion and aggregation. Stasys Medical is developing a system based on patented platelet contraction sensors to assay platelet contraction force as a biomarker for platelet dysfunction. In the current project, the Company will build on preliminary data to demonstrate that the force biomarker is sensitive to platelet inhibition via multiple pathways. Specifically, aims are designed to 1) correlate the platelet contractile force measurements to inhibition of platelet activation and adhesion pathways, and 2) benchmark the force assay to standard platelet function tests. The go/no-go criteria for moving to Phase II is demonstration that platelet force is sensitive to specific inhibitors and that the assay can identify platelet dysfunction currently missed by existing standard platelet function assays. In the Phase II project we will leverage data generated in the current project to develop an algorithm that can automatically identify antiplatelet medications. Clinically, this will be a valuable tool to identify medication non-responders. Taken together, the project will be used to support the Company’s 510(k) submission to FDA with claims directed at evaluating platelet function to assess clinical conditions, such as bleeding risk, associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs, and during and following cardiovascular surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US. In the Phase I project, Stasys Medical will build on preliminary data to show that the platelet contraction force biomarker reflects platelet function as proof-of-concept that the force assay can identify platelet dysfunction missed by existing assays.

"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes.

"Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the proposed research and technology transfer effort is to develop a low-cost, point-of-care, mobile device-based technology for automated identification of Still's murmur, the most common innocent (benign and harmless) heart murmur of childhood. This novel technology could reduce the current rate of over half a million children unnecessarily referred to pediatric cardiologists by primary care providers each year in the United States. In Phase I, AusculTech Dx and Children's National Medical Center developed a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying Still's murmur with high accuracy (90% sensitivity, 99% specificity). To enable digital recording, essential for computerized murmur analysis, we also developed a digital stethoscope that connects to a smartphone and is equivalent in performance to a commercial stethoscope. Our envisioned product, called StethAid, is a combination of this novel digital stethoscope and a smartphone application (app). Having successfully met the Phase I performance milestones, we now propose to fully develop StethAid and conduct a multicenter trial through the following three specific aims: (1) develop and test a clinical-grade digital stethoscope, (2) develop fully feature software app, (3) conduct a multicenter trial of automated Still's murmur identification. For the multicenter trial, we have expanded our collaboration to include Boston Children's Hospital and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Our deliverable for Phase II is a technology platform validated by leading pediatric cardiologists that is ready for seeking regulatory approvals, deployment at PCP offices, and commercialization. As a decision support system, StethAid could empower PCPs to identify Still's murmur accurately and thus reduce the huge number of unnecessary specialist referrals. This should save the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars annually, allow pediatric cardiologists to focus on patients with serious conditions, and protect healthy children and their families from the unnecessary anxiety, inconvenience, and expense of seeing a pediatric cardiologist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over half a million children are referred unnecessarily to pediatric cardiologists by general physicians for the evaluation of Still's murmur, a normal and harmless heart murmur. This project will develop and clinically validate a novel mobile technology for automated recognition of this murmur in order to reduce the current rate of such unnecessary referrals and associated costs and inconvenience.",Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children,9680749,R42HL131081,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Apple', 'Benign', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart murmur', 'Incidence', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'sound', 'tool', 'wasting', 'web interface']",NHLBI,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R42,2019,764643,0.005757201204584053
"Phase 1 cross over biodistribution study of [203Pb]VMT01 for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and [68Ga]VMT02 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of stage 4 melanoma SIGNIFICANCE: Melanoma incidence is rising faster than any other cancer and metastatic melanoma is typically fatal. Responses to targeted and immunotherapies can be remarkable, but low response rates, acquired resistance, and adverse side effects limit long-term quality of life for these patients. The overall response rate to all therapies remains dismally near 50% and the 5-year survival is <25%. Preclinical studies have identified radiolabeled peptides that target the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) as a potential therapeutic alternative. While this approach using -particle emitters has been largely ineffective preclinically, previous publications and our Phase I data have demonstrated efficacy of Viewpoint’s MC1R-targeted VMT01 -particle therapy in mice bearing melanoma tumors. Thus, VMT01 is designed to meet the significant unmet medical need to improve outcomes for these patients (initial indication of progressive stage 4 metastatic melanoma), with potential for expanded indications in combination with FDA-approved melanoma drugs (e.g., immunotherapies). In this revised Phase II SBIR project, Viewpoint will complete a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial to determine the safety of its companion diagnostics. It is further expected that the company will have gained a preliminary understanding of the effectiveness of [68Ga]VMT02 imaging (PET) to identify MC1R positive tumors and the utility of [203Pb]VMT01 imaging (SPECT) for performing patient dosimetry for personalized [212Pb]VMT01 -therapy. PREDICATE PHASE I MILESTONES include: efficacy (therapy and imaging) in mice; pharm/tox of lead VMT01; automated radiopharmaceutical production with GMP kits; exclusive licenses to IP; clinical consortium with Mayo Clinic and 203Pb supply with Lantheus Medical Imaging; CRO for statistics/clinical data (Compleware, Inc.); and a radiopharmacy partner (Hotshots Nuclear Medicine) for manufacturing/distribution of [203Pb]VMT01. EQUITY INVESTMENTS: Viewpoint has secured $650,000 in equity investment to establish manufacturing of 212Pb generators for future clinical therapy trials. The company will complete the following Aims toward its goals. AIM 1. Secure FDA “safe to proceed” designation to conduct the Phase 1 imaging trial of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02 under IND. AIM 2. Complete a Phase 1 safety and biodistribution study of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02 imaging in human subjects and demonstrate their utility for identifying MC1R positive tumors and performing patient-specific dosimetry. OUTCOMES: We expect to demonstrate the clinical safety of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02. We further expect to develop preliminary understanding of the efficacy of [68Ga]VMT02 PET/CT to identify MC1R+ tumors and the utility of [203Pb]VMT01 SPECT/CT for patient-specific dosimetry for [212Pb]VMT01 -therapy. Thus, we will be prepared to initiate dosimetry-based trials of [212Pb]VMT01 -particle therapy for metastatic melanoma to be funded under Phase IIB SBIR studies and Phase III equity investments. This project aims to complete a Phase 1 trial of companion diagnostics that would be used for patient selection and dosimetry for an radionuclide therapy for metastatic melanoma.

"Adaptive & Individualized AAC The heterogeneity of the more than 1.3% of Americans who suffer from severe physical impairments (SPIs) preclude the use of common augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) solutions such as manual signs, gestures or dexterous interaction with a touchscreen for communication. While efforts to develop alternative access methods through eye or head tracking have provided some communication advancements for these individuals, all current technologies suffer from the same fundamental limitation: existing AAC devices require patients to conform to generic communication access methods and interfaces rather than the device conforming to the user. Consequently, AAC users are forced to settle for interventions that require excessive training and cognitive workload only to deliver extremely slow information transfer rates (ITRs) and recurrent communication errors that ultimately deprive them of the fundamental human right of communication. To meet this health need, we propose the first smart-AAC system designed using individually adaptive access methods and AAC interfaces to accommodate the unique manifestations of motor impairments specific to each user. Preliminary research by our team of speech researchers at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital (Communication Center Lab) and Boston University (STEPP Lab), utilizing wearable sensors developed by our group (Altec, Inc) have already demonstrated that metrics based on surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer measures of muscle activity and movement for head-mediated control can be combined with optimizable AAC interfaces to improve ITRs when compared with traditional unoptimized AAC devices. Leveraging this pilot work, our team is now proposing a Phase I project to demonstrate the proof-of-concept that a single sEMG/IMU hybrid sensor worn on the forehead can provide improvements in ITR and communication accuracy when integrated with an AAC interface that is optimized through machine learning algorithms. The prototype system will be tested and compared to a conventional (non-adaptable) interface in subjects with SPI at a collaborative clinical site. Assistance by our speech and expert-AAC collaborators will ensure that all phases of technology development are patient-centric and usable in the context of clinical care. In Phase II we will build upon this proof-of-concept to design a smart-AAC system with automated optimization software that achieves dynamic learning which adapts to intra-individual changes in function through disease progression or training as well as inter-individual differences in motor impairments for a diverse set of users with spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, ALS, and other SPIs. The innovation is the first and only AAC technology that combines advancements in wearable-sensor access with interfaces that are autonomously optimized to the user, thereby reducing the resources and training needed to achieve effective person-centric communication in SPI, through improved HMI performance and reduced workload. This project addresses the fundamental mission of NIDCD (National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders) to provide a direct means of assisting communication for people with severe physical impairments caused by stroke, high level spinal cord injury, neural degeneration, or neuromuscular disease. Leveraging wearable access technology (which has barely been explored for AAC users), we will develop a first-of-its-kind adaptive tablet interface tailored to individual users through advanced movement classification algorithms. Through these efforts, we aim to provide an improved Human Machine Interface (HMI) that is able to accommodate varying degrees of inter- and intra-subject residual motor function and context dependent impairments to provide individuals with SPI the opportunity for improved societal integration and quality of life.",Adaptive & Individualized AAC,9907832,R43DC018437,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'American', 'Boston', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Facial Muscles', 'Fatigue', 'Forehead', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human Rights', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'communication device', 'deafness', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'novel', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation engineering', 'rehabilitation science', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'signal processing', 'technology development', 'touchscreen', 'two-dimensional', 'wearable device']",NIDCD,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2019,224701,-0.025845666975490518
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Environmental Imaging and Control for Exoskeletons to Improve Safety and Mobility Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system to improve the mobility and control of exoskeletons. Recent research has found that 3.86 million Americans require wheelchairs and the number has been increasing annually by an average annual rate of 5.9% per year. While wheelchairs provide freedom, allowing users to be independent as well as reducing dependence upon others, wheelchair use is not physically or emotionally equivalent to walking and is often thought to limit community participation and thus exacerbate social isolation. Robotic exoskeletons/bionic suits have the potential to enable these individuals to stand up and walk, thus providing a way to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society. Our proposal seeks to address one of the hurdles limiting the widespread adoption of exoskeletons in the home and community—the inability of the user to dynamically control gait parameters. This concept has the potential to significantly change the way exoskeletons work and facilitate their adoption into the market. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the proposed solution will provide users a practical way to adjust their suit’s gait to precisely achieve their navigational goals. Specific Aims: Phase I: 1) Build a prototype and Perform Preliminary Laboratory Testing; 2) Develop and Benchmark Algorithms; and 3) Perform Pilot Human Study of Prototype with Exoskeleton Subjects. Phase II: 1) Develop Customized, Production-Ready Hardware and Firmware 2) Integrate with Exoskeleton Control System; and 3) Perform an evaluation of the system through human study testing.

"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa.

In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children.

"Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety Project Summary/Abstract Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system for the sensing and control of stand-to-sit motions of a wearable bionics suit. Currently 5.6 million people in the US have impaired mobility from a number of different causes. The primary means of mobility for many of these patients is the wheelchair as it has been for most of the last 50 years. Despite all the benefits introduced by widespread use of the wheelchair, it remains a less than ideal mobility solution. Exoskeleton suits have the potential to empower individuals with impaired mobility with an alternative to wheelchairs that allows them to stand up and walk independently within their home and community has the potential to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society while also further improving their health and quality of life. For exoskeletons to gain acceptance in every-day independent home and community use, many control and safety related functionalities still need to be addressed. Our proposal seeks to address one of the gaps in allowing for independent use of exoskeletons in the home and community, namely, functionality to transition from standing to sitting in a safe manner. The proposed work will provide exoskeleton users with the new ability to independently sit down without assistance and confidence in being able to do so without falling and risking possible injuries. It aims to significantly change the way exoskeletons work thereby facilitating their adoption into the market and directly impacting the lives of individuals with disabilities. Project Narrative Exoskeletons can provide patients with SCI, stroke, and other types of impaired mobility access to extended duration, gravity dependent ambulation that can directly combat the risks associated with physical deconditioning. There are benefits for exoskeleton-use to gain widespread acceptance in every-day, independent home and community settings. Currently, exoskeletons are not approved for independent-use because functionalities like transferring from standing-to-sitting requires continuous assistance from caregivers.",Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety,9560683,R44AG057267,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bionics', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fall injury', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Letters', 'Mechanics', 'Metric System', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'blind', 'combat', 'community setting', 'critical period', 'deconditioning', 'design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'human study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation technology', 'robot exoskeleton', 'stroke patient']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2019,806285,-0.018256301397798567
"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9838988,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2019,1705298,-0.0066404990115939274
"Lightweight optoimpedance sensors enabling early detection of the physiological response to injury and illness Abstract Early detection of ongoing hemorrhage (OH) before onset of shock is a universally acknowledged great unmet need, and particularly important after trauma. Delays in the detection of OH are associated with a “failure to rescue” and a dramatic deterioration in prognosis once the onset of clinically frank shock has occurred. While uniplex noninvasive technologies have failed to detect or diagnose complex disease states, we have demonstrated the superiority of multiplex approaches in silico. The goal of this STTR project is to develop a commercially viable optoimpedance sensor-based system that combines state-of-the-art noninvasive sensing technologies and advanced multivariable statistical algorithms. Phase I will involve three Aims: 1) D​esign, Fabricate and Test Opto-Impedance oPiic sensors, 2) Develop of Mobile App, Data and ML Pipeline on Secure Cloud, and 3) Evaluate oPiics on an Unanesthetized Upright Porcine Hemorrhage Model. By derisking the hardware challenges, we will be well-positioned for a Phase II application to optimize oPiic design and manufacturing, fold-in predictive algorithms under current development with DOD support, and validate with a clinical trial in critical care setting. Project Narrative We have demonstrated that a multiplex approach is superior to predicting shock compared to single clinical devices alone. During a mass-casualty event, a predictive tool would need to be deployed widely, since only a fraction of individuals will have ongoing hemorrhage that will progress to decompensated shock. Optical and bioimpedance signals are critical indicators of muscle hemodynamics and electrolyte balance likely to be modified in the period leading up to shock. No commercial device exists that provides continuous, low-power, low-cost monitoring of these signals with characteristics suitable for integration with the multiplexing approach. This STTR application seeks Phase I funding to commercialize an opto-impedance sensor, called the ‘oPiic’, that will address this unmet need.",Lightweight optoimpedance sensors enabling early detection of the physiological response to injury and illness,9909081,R41EB029284,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber Optics', 'Funding', 'General anesthetic drugs', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Metabolism', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Muscle', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'college', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electric impedance', 'electrical property', 'hemodynamics', 'instrument', 'light weight', 'mass casualty', 'member', 'miniaturize', 'mobile application', 'optical sensor', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'preservation', 'programs', 'response', 'response to injury', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tissue oxygenation', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,"MULTIVARIATE SYSTEMS, INC.",R41,2019,155282,0.02379844539000097
"A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions Abstract. Melanoma is the third most common form of skin cancer with estimated 87,110 new cases diagnosed in the United States in the year 2017. Current routine diagnostic approaches utilize microscopic evaluation of thinly sectioned patient biopsies, but in certain cases diagnosis can be contentious even among experts. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize MelanoMap™, Frontier Diagnostics' patented assay for the diagnosis of melanoma using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) platform—and to have this assay available to pathologists in the U.S. as a laboratory developed test. MALDI IMS is a state-of-the-art technology that generates molecular images of tens to thousands of biomolecules from tissue sections in a single analysis. The assay uses formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies used in routine histopathological diagnosis. The proposed assay has pathologists select regions of skin biopsies for analysis via a remote web interface. The acquired IMS data from those regions unambiguously identifies malignant melanoma or benign nevus.  Phase I of this proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology platform to achieve cost-effective diagnosis of melanoma from patient skin biopsies at sample volumes acceptable for a clinical laboratory. Specific Aim 1 focuses on the development of a scalable and robust analytical protocol in both sample preparation and informatics to accurately diagnose melanoma with MALDI IMS. In specific aim 2, we will test the methodology developed in Specific Aim 1 on a cohort of melanocytic lesions with known clinical outcome and subsequently validate the classification accuracy of the proposed test  In Phase II, the protocols developed in Phase I will be integrated into a diagnostic service workflow. This phase will focus on quality control measures, client facing cloud software, clinical diagnostic reporting, and completing the analysis of a 500-patient sample set for final assay validation. Specific Aim 3 of this proposal (initial aim of Phase II) will establish and implement test tissues into standard workflows that will provide performance metrics for standard operation of a test meeting Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards. Protocols will be developed to monitor reagents, the reproducibility of sample preparation, and mass spectrometer performance on daily basis. Specific Aim 4 will expand software capabilities to include a secure web interface for clients ordering the test and the laboratory performing the test. The software will meet regulatory compliance, perform statistical analysis, and generate and communicate reports of the MALDI IMS analysis. Specific Aim 5 proposes to expand the sample set used in the initial assay from Specific Aim 2 to include a set of 300 patient samples from our clinical collaborators with 5 or more years follow-up data. The test will be independently validated by an additional 200 patient samples with definitive diagnoses. Project Narrative This multi-phase Fast Track SBIR project will develop and validate a new laboratory developed test to differentiate malignant melanocytic tumors from benign nevi and complete development of an imaging mass spectrometry-based diagnostic service platform for a clinical laboratory. The clinical assay developed under this proposal augments current practice by providing molecular measurements that are used as objective criteria in the diagnosis of melanoma.

"User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control ABSTRACT Approximately 41,000 individuals live with upper-limb loss (loss of at least one hand) in the US. Fortunately, prosthetic devices have advanced considerably in the past decades with the development of dexterous, anthropomorphic hands. However, potentially the most promising used control strategy, myoelectric control, lacks a correspondingly high-level of performance and hence the use of dexterous hands remains highly limited. The need for a complete overhaul in upper limb prosthesis control is well highlighted by the abandonment rates of myoelectric devices, which can reach up to 40% in the case of trans-humeral amputees. The area of research that has received the most focus over the past decade has been “pattern recognition,” which is a signal processing based control method that uses multi-channel surface electromyography as the control input. While pattern recognition provides intuitive operation of multiple prosthetic degrees of freedom, it lacks robustness and requires frequent, often daily calibration. Thus, it has not yet achieved the desired clinical acceptance. Our team proposes clinical translation of a novel highly adaptive upper limb prosthesis control system that incorporates two major advances: 1) machine learning (robust classification by implementing a non-boundary based algorithm), and 2) training by retrospectively incorporating user data from activities of daily living (ADL). The proposed system will enable machine intelligence with user input for prosthesis control. Our work is organized as follows: Phase I: (a) First, we will implement a fundamentally new machine intelligence technique, Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Sparse Representation Classification (EASRC), that is more resilient to untrained noisy conditions that users may encounter in the real-world and requires less data than traditional myoelectric signal processing. (b) In parallel, we will implement an adaptive learning algorithm, Nessa, which allows users to relabel misclassified data recorded during use and then update the EASRC classifier to adapt to any major extrinsic or intrinsic changes in the signals. Taken together, EASRC and Nessa comprise the Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system. Once, the RESCU implementation is complete, we will optimize the system through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University, and complete an iterative benchtop RESCU evaluation with a focus group of 3 amputee subjects and their prosthetists. Phase II: Verification and validation of RESCU will be completed, culminating in third-party validation testing and certification. Finally, we will complete a clinical assessment including self-reporting subjective measures, and real-world usage metrics in a long-term clinical study. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we aim to empower the user by bringing them into the control loop of their prosthesis and improve the stability of their control strategy over time. Specifically, we implement to a robust classifier, an adaptive learning algorithm, and a smartwatch interface, which allows the user to teach their device when it misunderstands the commands that the user is sending to control the prosthesis. This will result in improved control without cumbersome or time-consuming effort on the part of the user and, more importantly, we hope that it will give the user a greater sense of empowerment and ownership over their prosthesis.",User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control,9622537,U44NS108894,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Calibration', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prosthesis', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'empowerment', 'functional improvement', 'improved', 'innovation', 'myoelectric control', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prosthesis control', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,"INFINITE BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",U44,2018,216724,0.0011930354439059247
"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Summary / Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-I project proposes the development of an image- processing-based tool, named PostureCheck™, aimed at automatically detecting when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation exercises. The system will be based on a standard video camera (e.g., GoPro) that will be used to capture the movements of the subject.  The automatic detection of undesirable compensatory movements is especially important when patients use a rehabilitation robotic system with minimum supervision, i.e. when a single therapist oversees the therapeutic sessions of multiple patients simultaneously. In this context, PostureCheck™ may be capable of tracking robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises and enable feedback modalities to discourage the performance of undesirable compensatory movements.  Our long-term goal is to integrate PostureCheck™ with the Barrett Upper-extremity Robotic Trainer - BURT®, which we developed with special emphasis on stroke rehabilitation. The combination of PostureCheck™ with the BURT® device would be ideally suited for deployment in “Robotic Gyms”, where a single therapist oversees the therapeutic sessions of several patients simultaneously, thus allowing rehabilitation centers to offer high-dosage, high-intensity interventions despite the limited number of therapists currently available in the US.  To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we will develop PostureCheck™ to detect the most common compensatory movements automatically. To achieve this goal, we will rely on recently developed artificial intelligence (AI) methods referred to as Deep Learning. These methods have recently broken records in the human-posture analysis, joint-skeleton detection, and recognition of human activities using a single inexpensive camera. The proposed video-based PostureCheck™ tool will be the first system to exploit the capabilities of hybrid Deep Neural Networks, for real-time detection of compensatory movements during robot- assisted rehabilitation.  The proposed SBIR Phase-I activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, feedback from rehabilitation experts at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital will be used to collect video data and to label compensatory movements observed during the performance of robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises by using the BURT® system. In Aim 2, Deep Learning techniques will be used to develop a robust detection of undesirable compensatory movements during the performance of robot-assisted rehabilitation exercises. Finally, in Aim 3, the algorithms developed in Aim 2 will be optimized. Specifically, we will test implementations that are suitable to generate real-time feedback. Computationally efficient implementations of the algorithms will enable - in future studies - the development of new modalities of control of the rehabilitation robot with the objective of discouraging undesirable compensatory movements. Project Narrative  Each year, nearly 800,000 Americans suffer from a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and - eventually - improved function. This proposal aims to develop a novel video-based tool, named PostureCheck™, to detect undesirable compensatory movements and enable automatic corrective feedback to the patient during robot- assisted upper-limb therapy.",PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device,9678997,R43EB027525,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Records', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shoulder', 'Side', 'Skeleton', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Vision', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'dosage', 'efficacy evaluation', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'interest', 'meetings', 'monocular', 'motor impairment', 'motor recovery', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'robot assistance', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic device', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,"BARRETT TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R43,2018,223752,-0.08285098207297911
"Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens ABSTRACT  This SBIR Phase I project uses formative evaluation strategies to develop, test, refine, and evaluate an alpha prototype of the 10-session, evidence-based Strengthening Families Program 7-17 and SFP Home-Use DVD as a web-assisted platform. The Specific Aim of the new “SFP Online!” program is to increase family accessibility and engagement by transitioning from costly group-based, facilitator-led, parenting and family skills training to low cost web-delivery. SFP draws heavily on theories that integrate family dynamics (monitoring, bonding, and communication), parenting skills, youth drug etiology (risk and protective factors), and social learning. Substantial empirical evidence from 14 RCTs with diverse families and locations shows that SFP works with large program effect sizes to reduce behavioral health risks and substance abuse. Phase I will determine whether the adapted online version can reproduce outcomes of the facilitator-led family group version with minimal loss of fidelity, efficacy, and vitality. Five integrated formative evaluation strategies involving 380 participants including ten focus groups with potential end users (100 parents and 100 youth) from SFP providers nationwide will explore adaptations, usability, feasibility and barriers to use. Consumer preference surveys tapping both recent SFP DVD users and agency service providers will explore factors that may mitigate or enhance delivery of SFP Online. This approach based on input from both parents and youth and providers will ensure that SFP Online is culturally and developmentally appropriate. We will also rely on key informant interviews with 50 family service providers and community stakeholders to address barriers to implementation and the eventual integration of SFP Online into existing prevention and treatment strategies. We will include interviews with prevention scientists and e-learning experts to review the architectural plan and ensure fidelity to current prevention and technology initiatives. These consumer surveys will inform a product specification plan supporting a “wireframe technology” to make SFP Online a viable web-assisted program. To create the alpha prototype in Phase I SFP LLC will collaborate with 3C Institute, a leading software development company with extensive expertise building interactive multimedia technology for behavioral health interventions. 3C Institute will employ its proprietary Dynamic e-Learning Platform (DeLP), a customizable technology that integrates the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. LARS Research Institute, a leading behavioral technology transfer company will assist in the evaluation of the program’s adherence to the standards of evidence. We will also draw on extensive community support based on 30 years of administering SFP products to family service agencies nationwide and other CBOs that emphasize parent training, and drug and child maltreatment prevention. The proposed formative evaluation strategies and collaboration with ten national prevention and e-learning experts should ensure timely and successful completion of the Phase I research activities and produce an effortless transition to the Phase II build-and-test stage. Project Narrative – SFP Online! This Phase I SBIR study seeks to adapt the Strengthening Families Program, an evidence-based facilitator-led family skills training and youth drug prevention program with family classes and entertaining video clips, to a web-based platform. Providing parenting training and drug prevention via the web offers tremendous cost savings and provides an efficient conduit for mass dissemination.

"IGF::OT::IGF SBIR Topic 379: DigiBioMarC: Digital BioMarkers for Clinical Impact- Moonshot Project(Fast Track) The overall objective of this Fast-Track SBIR contract project is to develop DigiBioMarCTM (Digital BioMarkers for Clinical Impact), a scalable and flexible cloud-based platform to capture and analyze wearable, implantable, or external device data. This platform also provides an informatics tool for automated data aggregation, integration, and machine learning algorithms. It is based on the scalable user-centered Medable platform, which implements standardization and normalization of patient-generated data to drive health insights. DigiBioMarCTM will compare and combine disparate data streams to understand contextualized patient physiology in real time in order to identify disease and/or detect changes in disease/health status. It also will support cohort and clinical studies, particularly those testing digital biomarkers from wearable sensor technologies. This Fast-Track project will focus on product development with an ultimate aim of a product that improves cancer research data and clinical trials, enhances clinical care, and that can be used to engage patients in preventive health behaviors and treatment adherence. The Phase I goal is to develop a data-agnostic DigiBioMarCTM prototype for validation in Phase II. The Phase 1 Go/No-Go decision point to proceed to Phase II will be a working prototype with specified features for further development and validation in Phase II. n/a",IGF::OT::IGF SBIR Topic 379: DigiBioMarC: Digital BioMarkers for Clinical Impact- Moonshot Project(Fast Track),9788845,61201800010C,"['Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Informatics', 'Machine Learning', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Preventive', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'product development', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,"MEDABLE, INC.",N01,2018,224294,0.043959552439540917
"A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants Ensuring access to clean water for generations to come will involve developing novel ap- proaches to determining the safety and composition of potable water that are practical and afford- able. Arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are three of the top priorities among hazardous substances commonly found at Superfund sites, as they are linked to health problems in people exposed to them in drinking water, yet the current real-time monitoring methods for these and other contam- inants are either extremely costly or nonexistent, making it difﬁcult to monitor water quality with high spatial or temporal resolution. QBiSci is developing a biosensor that uses synthetic micro- bial sensor strains that ﬂuoresce in response to speciﬁc toxins to continuously monitor water for contamination. The platform will substantially improve upon currently available technologies for toxin detection, making monitoring more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable. Speciﬁc Aim 1: To fully characterize three synthetic E. coli strains that speciﬁcally detect ar- senic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water stream. For a real-time sensor to be maxi- mally effective, it must be able to report accurate toxin concentrations in real-time. Focusing on three of the highest priority contaminants as a proof of feasibility, comprehensive data will be acquired to train a machine learning algorithm to be able classify real-world samples in real-time. Speciﬁc Aim 2: To develop and train a classiﬁcation algorithm to recognize the type and amount of each contaminant present in a continuous water stream. The ability to analyze and interpret data in real-time from a constantly ﬂuctuating water source will require an extensive classiﬁcation train- ing effort. QBiSci's existing machine learning framework will be trained and tested using many contamination induction scenarios, ranging from sudden pulses to subtly varying concentrations. Speciﬁc Aim 3: To develop a microﬂuidic cartridge system that reduces device complexity and enables sensor deployment with minimal intervention. QBiSci will develop a swappable car- tridge system using devices that are pre-loaded with biologically-stable strains and can simply be “plugged in” to the sensor platform to achieve repeatable results in a user-friendly manner. The development of a method for thermoplastic device fabrication will enable the more precise connections required for a cartridge clamping system that will require little operational expertise.  A successful outcome of this proposal will lead to a biosensor capable of real-time quantiﬁca- tion of arsenic, mercury, and cadmium in a continuous water input. A future Phase II proposal would focus on real-world performance evaluations of our sensors via deployment in areas of con- cern and comparison of our results to standard techniques as well as an expansion of the platform to detect other contaminants quantitatively and continuously. 1 Access to clean, reliable water supplies is critical to our quality of life and our economy, yet across the country over 100,000 hazardous waste sites are so heavily contaminated that the un- derlying groundwater doesn't meet drinking water standards. While there is a wide range of toxins found at these sites, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium are among the most common offend- ers, all of which have been linked to a variety of health problems ranging from cancer to dia- betes as well as behavior and neurological disorders. We are developing a customizable real-time biosensor that will enable contamination monitoring to become more affordable, continuous, and ﬁeld-deployable and will facilitate improved management decisions aimed at reducing toxin con- centrations in the environment, tracking the progression of contamination plums, and targeting investments in remediation efforts. 1",A Customizable Real-Time Biosensor for Continuous Monitoring of Water Contaminants,9467134,R43ES028993,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arsenic', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Cadmium', 'Classification', 'Closure by clamp', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hazardous Substances', 'Hazardous Waste Sites', 'Health', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plug-in', 'Plum', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'contaminated water', 'cost', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'real time monitoring', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'superfund site', 'temporal measurement', 'user-friendly', 'water quality']",NIEHS,"QUANTITATIVE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2018,162205,0.020869403960514395
"Evaluating and Improving Assistive Robotic Devices Continuously and in Real-time Project Summary Lower limb assistive robotic devices, such as active prosthesis, orthoses, and exoskeletons have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an increased energetic cost of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment, using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since the signals are noisy, sparsely sampled, and dynamically delayed. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment, further restricting the applicability of the method on a larger scale. We propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in real-time. Aim 1 will determine salient signal features and characterize the dynamics of sensing metabolic work rate from a variety of physiological sensor signals. Aim 2 will use advanced sensor fusion and machine learning techniques to accurately predict instantaneous energy cost in real-time from multiple physiological signals without relying on a metabolic mask. Aim 3 will use the obtained real-time estimates to optimize push-off timing for an active robotic prosthesis. The resulting methods will enable an automated and continuous evaluation of assistive robotic devices that can be realized outside the laboratory and with simple wearable sensors. This automated evaluation will enable devices, such as active prostheses, orthoses, or exoskeletons, that can self-monitor their performance, optimize their own behavior, and continuously adapt to changing circumstances. This will open up a radically new way of human-robot- interaction for assistive devices. It will greatly increase their clinical viability and enable novel advanced controllers and algorithms that can improve device performance on a subject specific basis. Project Narrative A common way of evaluating assistive robotic devices, such as active prostheses or exoskeletons, is by measuring the reduction in effort that they bring to an individual walking in them. The proposed project will develop ways to perform this evaluation automatically and in real-time by the device itself, which will be used in the future to develop prostheses and exoskeletons that automatically adapt themselves to their users.

"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional. Our goal is to develop a low- cost, easy-to-use, scalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally.","Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor",9711194,R43EB024299,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Baltimore', 'Brazil', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Status', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guatemala', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'India', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Mali', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'faculty research', 'health care disparity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'lens', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'success', 'vector']",NIBIB,"PLENOPTIKA, INC.",R43,2018,99914,-0.029649354859506583
"Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease 1 Abstract  2  3 This is a Phase I SBIR proposal to develop a non-contact and non-invasive imaging device for assisting clinicians  4 in selecting the appropriate level-of-amputation (LOA) in limbs with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Surgeons  5 prefer to salvage as much limb tissue as possible during amputation to increase patient mobility while decreasing  6 morbidity and mortality. However, clinicians must balance this preference against the likelihood of primary wound  7 healing at a given level of amputation (LOA), which decreases with more distal amputations. There are no gold-  8 standard tests to aid clinicians in selecting the LOA in patients with PAD, therefore reported rates of re-  9 amputation in current practice are substantial. Up to 20% percent of above-the-knee amputations to 35% of 10 foot amputations require revision to a more proximal level. Furthermore, physician awareness of the risk for 11 re-amputation may lead to overly aggressive selection of LOA to more proximal levels in some cases. Indeed, 12 certain patients may receive amputations at a level more proximal than is necessary because their surgeon could 13 not confidently predict a high likelihood of healing at a more distal level. 14 15 In current practice, selection of LOA is determined qualitatively by clinical judgment of the surgeon using patient 16 history and physical exam. Others have developed quantitative tests that assess local microcirculation. These 17 technologies have not superseded clinical judgement. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is 18 developing an imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging with a machine learning algorithm 19 to provide a quantitative assessment of the healing potential of a selected LOA whereas current clinical 20 practice is only capable of qualitative assessment. 21 22 We have proof-of-concept of our technology’s ability to characterize microvascular blood flow changes in a 23 patient with critical limb ischemia. In this proposal, we intend to establish the utility of our device for predicting 24 the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA by demonstrating the effectiveness of DeepView assessment 25 on a large set of pre-amputation images. To this end we will conduct a Phase I pilot study for the use of our 26 device in predicting the healing potential of a clinician selected LOA. This clinical study will develop a data set 27 for training the algorithm, and deliver a clear demonstration of feasibility for completing the development on an 28 algorithm that has high accuracy in predicting the healing potential of the proposed amputation site. Following 29 this work, we will apply for a Phase II proposal intended to finalize algorithm training, validate the algorithm 30 developed in Phase I, and establish a successful regulatory and commercialization pathway. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",Non-invasive device to assist selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease,9622035,R43HL142428,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Ankle', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Judgment', 'Knee', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Microcirculation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postoperative Period', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Skin Tissue', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'Wound Healing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'commercialization', 'design', 'foot', 'healing', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'patient mobility', 'phase 1 study', 'preference', 'standard of care', 'success', 'wound']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2018,196561,0.01125832512845684
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research PROJECT SUMMARY This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0™ that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud™ Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb’s DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9741597,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communications Media', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'experimental study', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'service learning', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2018,99999,0.03278718279109864
"Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication Intoxication from marijuana (MJ) impairs psychomotor performance and at least doubles the risk of motor vehicle accidents. The ongoing wave of legalization of MJ has brought increasing prevalence of driving while intoxicated with MJ. However, there is no quantitative biologic test that can accurately determine whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ intoxication. Assays of the primary intoxicating substance in MJ, THC, in body fluids has a high false negative rate as THC is cleared from blood within 15 minutes, long before impairment is resolved. And assays of THC metabolites yield a high false positive rate because clearance of these metabolites can take weeks. Thus there is now no nor is there likely to ever be a test of blood, breath or body fluids that can accurately detect MJ intoxication. In response to this significant knowledge gap, this project aims to develop an accurate, portable method for detection of impairment due to MJ intoxication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a non-invasive, safe brain imaging technique that capitalizes on differences in the light absorption spectra of deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), that allows the measurement of relative changes in Hb concentration that reflect brain activity. fNIRS can be performed in natural environments at low cost, and thus can be used in real-world settings. In Phase I, we will develop an algorithm for individual-level detection of impairment from THC using fNIRS measurements. To do so, we will assess the effect of oral THC (or placebo) on fNIRS measurements, self-reported intoxication, and impairment as defined by the gold standard field sobriety test conducted by a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) in 40 healthy MJ users. fNIRS assessments will examine (1) the effect of THC exposure on resting state and task-based activation in the prefrontal cortex, (2) the extent to which impairment in psychomotor functioning with THC administration correlates with THC-induced change in hemodynamic responses detected with fNIRS, and (3) the sensitivity and specificity and area under the ROC curve of fNIRS measurements and field sobriety test determinants of impairment. Milestone: Should machine learning applications to the data generate an algorithm that predicts impairment with >80% accuracy compared with a gold standard field sobriety test, we will proceed to Phase II. In Phase II, we will conduct fNIRS testing in 150 individuals under THC/placebo as in Phase I and in 50 individuals in a THC plus alcohol/placebo condition in order to further refine the algorithm for MJ impairment detection such that fNIRS detection concurs with field sobriety testing with >90% specificity. It is anticipated that this level of specificity could be used in legal definitions of impairment. This will warrant commercialization, which will be followed by prototype development and field testing. An accurate, quantitative, biological test that is user-friendly and enables law enforcement to detect impairment from MJ has the potential to dramatically change practice of law enforcement across the country and the world and thus has enormous commercial potential, as outlined in the Commercialization Plan and in accompanying letters of support. The goal of this project is to develop, test, and refine a method to accurately and reliably detect marijuana (MJ) impairment using a portable, user-friendly, non-invasive, brain-based modality. MJ doubles the chance of motor vehicle accidents, yet, there now exists no valid, biologically based method to detect whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ. The development of a reliable, quantitative biological marker that enables law enforcement officers to screen individuals whom they suspect are impaired from MJ will have highly significant public health importance and enormous commercial potential.",Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication,9541180,R42DA043977,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Body Fluids', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cannabis', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Driving While Intoxicated', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Legal', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Oral', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Psychomotor Impairments', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'System', 'THC exposure', 'Testing', 'Tetrahydrocannabinol', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vendor', 'absorption', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'behavior test', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'density', 'detector', 'driving under influence', 'drug testing', 'field sobriety tests', 'field study', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'interest', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vehicular accident']",NIDA,"HIGHLIGHTI, INC",R42,2018,731789,0.015026636339081158
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,9622047,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2018,1057846,0.01122768962722258
"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. Project Narrative People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes. This technology enables continuous access to communication, maintains one’s ability to drive a wheelchair and allows a person to drink or suction themselves, providing good hydration, respiratory health and hygiene.",Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions,9644103,R44HD093467,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Hydration status', 'Hygiene', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lighting', 'Logic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Research Design', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Saliva', 'Self Care', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spastic Tetraplegia', 'Speech', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Suction', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Tube', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Variant', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'body system', 'commercialization', 'communication device', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'manufacturability', 'meetings', 'product development', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'research and development', 'respiratory health', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"BLUE SKY DESIGNS, INC.",R44,2018,519349,-0.0275392716805323
"A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions Abstract. Melanoma is the third most common form of skin cancer with estimated 87,110 new cases diagnosed in the United States in the year 2017. Current routine diagnostic approaches utilize microscopic evaluation of thinly sectioned patient biopsies, but in certain cases diagnosis can be contentious even among experts. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize MelanoMapTM, Frontier Diagnostics' patented assay for the diagnosis of melanoma using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) platform—and to have this assay available to pathologists in the U.S. as a laboratory developed test. MALDI IMS is a state-of-the-art technology that generates molecular images of tens to thousands of biomolecules from tissue sections in a single analysis. The assay uses formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies used in routine histopathological diagnosis. The proposed assay has pathologists select regions of skin biopsies for analysis via a remote web interface. The acquired IMS data from those regions unambiguously identifies malignant melanoma or benign nevus.  Phase I of this proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology platform to achieve cost-effective diagnosis of melanoma from patient skin biopsies at sample volumes acceptable for a clinical laboratory. Specific Aim 1 focuses on the development of a scalable and robust analytical protocol in both sample preparation and informatics to accurately diagnose melanoma with MALDI IMS. In specific aim 2, we will test the methodology developed in Specific Aim 1 on a cohort of melanocytic lesions with known clinical outcome and subsequently validate the classification accuracy of the proposed test  In Phase II, the protocols developed in Phase I will be integrated into a diagnostic service workflow. This phase will focus on quality control measures, client facing cloud software, clinical diagnostic reporting, and completing the analysis of a 500-patient sample set for final assay validation. Specific Aim 3 of this proposal (initial aim of Phase II) will establish and implement test tissues into standard workflows that will provide performance metrics for standard operation of a test meeting Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards. Protocols will be developed to monitor reagents, the reproducibility of sample preparation, and mass spectrometer performance on daily basis. Specific Aim 4 will expand software capabilities to include a secure web interface for clients ordering the test and the laboratory performing the test. The software will meet regulatory compliance, perform statistical analysis, and generate and communicate reports of the MALDI IMS analysis. Specific Aim 5 proposes to expand the sample set used in the initial assay from Specific Aim 2 to include a set of 300 patient samples from our clinical collaborators with 5 or more years follow-up data. The test will be independently validated by an additional 200 patient samples with definitive diagnoses. Project Narrative This multi-phase Fast Track SBIR project will develop and validate a new laboratory developed test to differentiate malignant melanocytic tumors from benign nevi and complete development of an imaging mass spectrometry-based diagnostic service platform for a clinical laboratory. The clinical assay developed under this proposal augments current practice by providing molecular measurements that are used as objective criteria in the diagnosis of melanoma.

"Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer Every year in the US, 650,000 cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy. As a side effect,  their neutrophil counts (number of white blood cells that aid in fighting infections) become low  (referred to as neutropenia) and expose them to febrile neutropenia (FN) which are episodes  of serious infection that entail costly hospitalization and sometimes death. If  neutropenia is detected early, FN can be avoided through timely delivery of  prophylactic antibiotics or growth stimulating factors. Currently, neutrophil measurements require  visits to healthcare centers. This increases infection risk (as measurements are taken infrequently  and low counts may not be detected before infections ensue) and reduces chemotherapy efficacy (as  chemotherapy levels are kept at the lower end of frequency and dose for safety). We aim to overcome  this limitation with PointCheck, a noninvasive neutrophil test that can be used frequently in  local health centers or at home, enabling physicians to minimize infections and  personalize chemotherapy planning. The basis for our technology is noninvasive optical imaging of  microcirculation in nailfold capillaries. We conducted a pilot clinical study where trained   nurses used PointCheck to acquire data from 46 chemotherapy patients. By manually analyzing  a training dataset (N=38 measurements from 16 patients), we built a labeled dataset of flow gaps in  the microcirculation that can be considered proxies of neutrophils and demonstrated their number  can be used to distinguish baseline patients (>500 neutrophils/mm3) from grade IV neutropenic ones  (<500/mm3). However, the need for manual analysis makes the technology inaccessible to patients on  its current status. With support from SBIR Phase I, we will (a) develop algorithms that automatize  the manual data processing workflow employed on our training set, (b) test those algorithms on our  acquired and unanalyzed testing database (N=103 measurements from 30 patients) and (c) generate  additional performance data including further intermediate neutrophil ranges (>500 and <1,500  neutrophils/mm3), thus fulfilling the requirements for a minimum viable product. The consecution of  these milestones will enable, in Phase II, using PointCheck in a multi-site diagnostic validation  trial to confirm, under clinical conditions, that the management of FN can be improved with this  new paradigm. Development of a portable optical imaging device that can noninvasively  detect neutropenia-related immunosuppression, to enable more frequent monitoring of  chemotherapy patients so that timely medical interventions can be staged before  life-threatening infections develop.",Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer,9622596,R43CA228920,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Blinded', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'FPS-FES Oncogene', 'Fever', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hematology', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Microcirculation', 'Monitor', 'Neutropenia', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'fighting', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'mortality', 'movie', 'neutrophil', 'non-invasive\xa0optical imaging', 'oncology', 'optical imaging', 'personalized chemotherapy', 'point of care', 'portability', 'prophylactic', 'prototype']",NCI,"LEUKO LABS, INC.",R43,2018,213919,-0.0041330331011041705
"Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports Title: Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports Project Summary/Abstract Population level studies have shown that the device-based hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with increased risks of reoperation during follow-up, when compared to traditional laparoscopic sterilization. However, secondary data sources often lack the granularity to understand the nature of patient and device complications related to the device removal and additional surgery. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database houses medical device reports submitted to the FDA by mandatory and voluntary reporters. These reports contain detailed information of patient and device adverse events. But due to its narrative structure, research with the reports has been limited, partially due to the restrictions of keyword search and manual review. The proposed study will innovatively apply natural language processing (NLP) to analyze MAUDE reports of device removals. NLP is a powerful tool capable of extracting information efficiently from documents such as medical notes, allowing the summarization of thousands of adverse event reports in a cost-effective way. The primary aim is to develop an NLP program to extract and summarize patient- and device-specific complications associated with device removal and additional surgeries following hysteroscopic sterilization. Secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of regulatory activities on adverse event reporting behavior and structure. The hypotheses are that the majority of reported removals were associated with device-related complications as opposed to persistent symptoms only, and that after the FDA convened a panel discussion in September 2015, adverse event reports were more likely to be submitted by mandatory reporters, with improvement in structured presentation. Adverse event reports related to device removal will be selected from the MAUDE database using keyword search first, and 1,000 reports will be annotated and used to develop and validate the NLP tool. Applying the developed NLP to all reports, extracted information will be used for the analysis, and comparisons will be made before and after September 2015. The significance of the proposed research is that it will develop a method to better utilize adverse event reports to obtain crucial device safety information supplemental to regular population-level studies. By achieving this, the long term goal is to create a useful tool for future medical device safety surveillance to understand the nature of adverse events. The immediate next step will be to use the tool to investigate device safety in other areas. The comprehension of the nature of device adverse events and the elucidation of the crucial role of regulatory activity in facilitating reliable adverse event reporting will help promote patient safety evaluation and monitoring. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on device adverse event reports and develop a powerful tool to analyze reports to understand the nature of patient and device complications related to device removals and additional surgeries. The study will also elucidate the impact of regulatory activities on adverse event reporting. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to part of AHRQ's mission to make health care safer.",Developing Evidence for Safety Surveillance from Device Adverse Event Reports,9586941,R03HS026291,[' '],AHRQ,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R03,2018,96907,-0.013435209838895193
"Development and feasibility of prevention-minded oral health mobile App based on dietary selections and oral hygiene events. The number of decayed and filled tooth surfaces in primary dentition is on the rise in US children between the ages of 2 and 11 years old; in fact, 60% of adolescents (between 12 and 19 years old) and 9 out of 10 dentate seniors (age 65+) bear evidence of dental caries. Reinforced with a 2011-12 report stating 91% of those between the ages of 20 and 64 have dental caries, virtually all walks of life are thus affected – and this doesn’t even include those unreported, or those with significant dental erosion or gingival recession. Thus, these statistics could imply there is a significant unmet need in creating improved mechanisms for healthier dietary and hygienic habits. One way to achieve healthier habits and behavior is through effective communication. However, disconnects exist between oral health messaging and the patient’s understanding of clinical recommendations: in fact, oral health organizations recognize the need to improve and empower the public’s oral health literacy. Although adherence to preventive plans are critical to thwarting tooth decay, a patient’s poor oral health understanding and knowledge, even after a dental visit, persistently introduce factors that diminish preventive efforts and favorable oral health outcomes: for example, a clinical report revealed the average patient only recounts about half of the recommended dental advice. Oral health literacy is a relatively new area of research and there are few innovations in this space. Therefore, opportunities that address oral health illiteracy and behavioral barriers utilizing today’s 21st century technology may promote better oral health outcomes. Such approaches are already well-under way for systemic health, but thus far, prevention-minded oral health measures are lacking. We believe a unique approach exists that utilizes something most people, both young and old, access on a daily basis: a mobile device. Our approach is underlined by recent statistics released by the Pew Center: more than 8 out of 10 U.S. adults access mobile devices for information, including more than 67% of seniors (65+ years of age). Utilizing our proven strengths and successes in preventive dentistry innovations and mobile application (App) development, in this Phase I proposal we will determine feasibility of creating a prototype oral health App that scores dietary and oral hygiene events utilizing algorithms devised from libraries of empirical nutritional and scientific data (laboratory and clinical). In doing so, this Phase I proposal has three Specific Aims: empirical nutritional and scientific data mining; multi-tiered decision tree algorithm construction with putative scoring index based on Aim #1 data; and, development of a prototype mobile App based on Aims #1 and #2. If successful and with clinical testing expected in a Phase II proposal, the long-term goal of this research is to deploy and commercialize an oral health App that promotes clinically effective oral health behavior. The constant feed from mined data libraries and social-engineering aspects are expected to drive routine use of the App, thus engaging the user towards favorable habits and healthier outcomes.

"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids (HA) that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for HAs, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based on individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one’s ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely can result in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change HA service delivery models yet can be implemented within existing business models and in concert with current practitioners. The ISPS method effectively replaces target-based HA fitting (e.g. NAL-NL2) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. The proposed work follows successful completion of our pilot project and builds upon the research team’s prior research on novel fitting methods for cochlear implant (CI) devices recently acquired by Cochlear, Ltd. Following the successful implementation of ISPS and integration with commercial HA software in the pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility including a field study in which performance outcomes for the ISPS method were as good as a conventional HA fitting method and only took a fraction of the time, despite ISPS having no prior knowledge of patient characteristics and no audiogram. Successful maturation and commercialization of the ISPS technology in Phase II will address several barriers identified in the previous RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure, and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting HAs), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs), and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to HA fitting for patients who tend to avoid professional help). This Phase II project will develop an operational ISPS method by (1) integrating ISPS with hardware/software systems of our industry partners, (2) refine and enhance the ISPS method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of fitting hearing instruments, (3) build support for the use of ISPS in multiple marketplaces, and (4) evaluate the technology through field trials in different service delivery environments by comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase III project will focus on the transition of the technology to support remote and self-fitting of hearing instruments. This project seeks to develop, implement and test a novel automated method for fitting hearing aids based on real-time speech perception performance. This automated approach can improve hearing aid success while significant reducing costs of hearing health care. The automation of the fitting procedure can dramatically increase accessibility of hearing health care.",Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II,9472306,R44DC016249,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Audiology', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Automation', 'Businesses', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Service delivery model', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'graph theory', 'health care service', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inclusion criteria', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'software systems', 'sound', 'success']",NIDCD,"SECURBORATION, INC.",R44,2018,732079,-0.05840807513941448
"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9558429,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2018,825561,-0.0066404990115939274
"Handheld ultrasound system for real-time thoracic epidural analgesia guidance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is the gold standard for treating acute pain following major thoracic and abdominal surgeries and in patients with fractured ribs. Of the 51 million inpatient surgeries performed in the US each year, an estimated 3 - 6 million are eligible for TEA. Multiple randomized control trials have demonstrated significantly improved patient outcomes when receiving TEA instead of systemic opioids, including reduced 90-day mortality (3.1 vs 4.9%), improved postoperative pain control, reduced pulmonary and cardiovascular complications, and reduced incidence of chronic pain syndromes. In addition, TEA is associated with increased patient satisfaction, shortened hospital stays, and a significant reduction in the cost of perioperative care (e.g. savings between $4,675 - $22,000 per patient vs systemic opioids). However, TEA is regarded as one of the most technically difficult procedures executed by anesthesiologists, in large part because epidural needle placement is guided by manual palpation of spinal bone landmarks followed by “blind” needle insertion. Palpation of spine landmarks is unreliable for identifying the epidural space (i.e. 30% accuracy) and results in high TEA failure rates (15 – 35%) due to catheter misplacement outside of the intended epidural space. Halving the number of TEA failures per year is estimated to reduce the number of postoperative deaths by 25,000 per year and result in a $15.5B/yr economic benefit due to reduced cost of care and fewer premature deaths.  During the Phase I project, the feasibility of a low-cost, handheld ultrasound system and new automated image guidance technologies was demonstrated by imaging in vitro thoracic spine phantoms and human thoracic spines. This Phase II proposal seeks funding to support the continued development of a low-cost, handheld medical device for thoracic epidural guidance. The key technological innovations of this project are focused on improvements to ultrasound-based beamforming for enhanced bone visualization and include a new spinal bone imaging approach that enables the automatic detection of spinal bone landmarks and needle insertion site. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate a portable, low-cost, ultrasound-based medical device that facilitates thoracic epidural placement in the postoperative patient population, improves success rates, and lowers the risk of associated health complications.  The Phase II hypothesis is that the handheld medical imaging device and associated technologies increases first-attempt epidural analgesia success rates, defined as successful epidural administration on the first needle insertion attempt. New ultrasound beamforming technologies for a low-channel count ultrasound transducer design for improved bone imaging performance will be designed, fabricated, and tested. In addition, ultrasound imaging technologies central to this project will be optimized, integrated into the new device, and validated in a clinical study. Finally, the Phase II hypothesis will be directly tested in an 80 patient clinical study. With an estimated 3 – 6 million patients eligible for thoracic epidural administration each year, the estimated US market size for the proposed device is $325 M/yr. PROJECT NARRATIVE Thoracic epidural analgesia is the current standard of care for postoperative pain management following thoracic or abdominal surgery. Failures occur at high rates due to a reliance on manual palpation of bone landmarks to guide needle placement, which results in numerous adverse events: incomplete analgesia, increased mortality, higher pain scores, headache, dural puncture, back pain, parathesia, and paralysis. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate a portable, low-cost, ultrasound-based medical device that facilitates thoracic epidural placement, improves success rates, and lowers the risk of associated health complications.",Handheld ultrasound system for real-time thoracic epidural analgesia guidance,9475793,R44GM123791,"['Abdomen', 'Absence of pain sensation', 'Acute Pain', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Back Pain', 'Cadaver', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Assisted', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Epidural Analgesia', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Headache', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Needles', 'Nerve Block', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pain management', 'Palpation', 'Paralysed', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative Care', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Puncture procedure', 'Randomized', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Rib Fractures', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Spinal', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic epidural analgesia', 'Time', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'bone', 'bone imaging', 'bone visualization', 'care costs', 'chronic pain', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'contrast enhanced', 'control trial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'epidural space', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'imaging approach', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inpatient surgery', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pain score', 'patient population', 'portability', 'premature', 'standard of care', 'success', 'technological innovation', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RIVANNA MEDICAL, LLC",R44,2018,793271,-0.09353032112297732
"IGF::OT::IGF Constructed Environments for Successfully Sustaining Abstinence Through Immersive and On-Demand Treatment. Period of Performance: September 22, 2017 - March 21, 2018. N43DA-17-5583.   Charles River Analytics and our partners at Massachusetts General Hospital and Virtual Reality Medical Center propose to design and demonstrate Constructed Environments for Successfully Sustaining Abstinence Through Immersive and On-Demand Treatment (CESSATION). We will build VR environments using our in-house game engine and content (cues) that are diverse, realistic, and well-placed, bolstering traditional psychological therapy delivery, and use research-based principles of narrative and game design to produce immersive and engaging content to motivate continued use. We will use probabilistic models (e.g., Bayesian networks) and machine-learning (e.g., neural nets) to learn from patient data and clinician input to assist in selecting and combining therapies in a way that is tailored to the individual patient. Finally, CESSATION will communicate information to clinicians in a manner that is understandable, and gives them enough meta-information to foster appropriate trust in the system. The anticipated results of the proposed Phase I work are: (1) an initial domain analysis; (2) initial VR content; (3) initial motivational content; (4) prototype sensor capabilities; (5) a prototype Intervention Tailoring Component; (6) a prototype Clinician User Interface and Remote Patient Data Server; and (7) an initial Phase I CESSATION prototype demonstration and evaluation. n/a","IGF::OT::IGF Constructed Environments for Successfully Sustaining Abstinence Through Immersive and On-Demand Treatment.

"User-driven fitting of hearing aids and other assistive hearing devices Hearing aids are the principal tool today for ameliorating age-related hearing loss and its significant social, cognitive and functional costs to patients and society at large. However, many individuals who are prescribed hearing aids do not use them at all, or use them only occasionally. Most reasons behind the “hearing aid in the drawer” phenomenon relate to the characteristics of the sound produced, and could, in theory, be addressed with the correct signal processing strategy. The problem persists despite the increased complexity and power of new devices, for three reasons: (a) The hearing aid parameters, as set in the clinic, introduce distortion or render audible many sounds that the hearing impaired user had become accustomed to not hearing. The novelty is often so uncomfortable for the user as to discard the device. (b) The optimum parameters vary depending on the listening task and environment. Under some conditions, a device with parameters designed for a different condition will perform worse than no device at all. (c) The clinical fitting is derived from a non-ideal way to assess auditory function (the pure- tone audiogram). The optimum parameters for the actual impairment may be different from those of the prescribed fitting. Although it is true that the physiological mechanisms make it impossible to process sound so as to completely reverse the effect of sensorineural hearing loss, a device that delivers some benefit at all times is likely to be used all the time. The goal is to develop a hearing aid that can adaptively change its parameters to address the problems above, and will be accomplished with a novel fitting approach that rapidly presents a number of parameter settings to the user and lets the user guide the system toward the optimal settings for each listening situation. This requires the development of machine-learning algorithms to effectively search the parameter space and user interface devices and instructions that are easy for the patient to use. The focus of this Phase I proposal is the development of the algorithms and the adaptive user-driven fitting program, and to compare the proposed fitting with the traditional audiogram-based fitting across measures of functional hearing (ability to recognize speech in noise) and subjective preference. A hearing aid user is often dissatisfied with the sound quality of their device, despite its sophistication and adjustment by a trained audiologist. The problem can be mitigated by letting the user fine-tune the device for maximum comfort in everyday use. We will apply modern machine learning methods to develop a program for efficient user-driven fitting of hearing assistive devices.",User-driven fitting of hearing aids and other assistive hearing devices,9409910,R43DC016251,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Back', 'Books', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Presbycusis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'social', 'sound', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,"CARAWAY SOFTWARE, INC.",R43,2017,224966,0.0068714882108189225
"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional. Our goal is to develop a low- cost, easy-to-use, scalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally.","Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor",9312420,R43EB024299,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Baltimore', 'Brazil', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Status', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guatemala', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'India', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Mali', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'faculty research', 'health care disparity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'lens', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'success', 'vector']",NIBIB,"PLENOPTIKA, INC.",R43,2017,200225,-0.029649354859506583
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0(tm) that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud(tm) Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb's DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9354497,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communications Media', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'experimental study', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'service learning', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2017,739402,0.03343436576946851
"Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication Intoxication from marijuana (MJ) impairs psychomotor performance and at least doubles the risk of motor vehicle accidents. The ongoing wave of legalization of MJ has brought increasing prevalence of driving while intoxicated with MJ. However, there is no quantitative biologic test that can accurately determine whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ intoxication. Assays of the primary intoxicating substance in MJ, THC, in body fluids has a high false negative rate as THC is cleared from blood within 15 minutes, long before impairment is resolved. And assays of THC metabolites yield a high false positive rate because clearance of these metabolites can take weeks. Thus there is now no nor is there likely to ever be a test of blood, breath or body fluids that can accurately detect MJ intoxication. In response to this significant knowledge gap, this project aims to develop an accurate, portable method for detection of impairment due to MJ intoxication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a non-invasive, safe brain imaging technique that capitalizes on differences in the light absorption spectra of deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), that allows the measurement of relative changes in Hb concentration that reflect brain activity. fNIRS can be performed in natural environments at low cost, and thus can be used in real-world settings. In Phase I, we will develop an algorithm for individual-level detection of impairment from THC using fNIRS measurements. To do so, we will assess the effect of oral THC (or placebo) on fNIRS measurements, self-reported intoxication, and impairment as defined by the gold standard field sobriety test conducted by a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) in 40 healthy MJ users. fNIRS assessments will examine (1) the effect of THC exposure on resting state and task-based activation in the prefrontal cortex, (2) the extent to which impairment in psychomotor functioning with THC administration correlates with THC-induced change in hemodynamic responses detected with fNIRS, and (3) the sensitivity and specificity and area under the ROC curve of fNIRS measurements and field sobriety test determinants of impairment. Milestone: Should machine learning applications to the data generate an algorithm that predicts impairment with >80% accuracy compared with a gold standard field sobriety test, we will proceed to Phase II. In Phase II, we will conduct fNIRS testing in 150 individuals under THC/placebo as in Phase I and in 50 individuals in a THC plus alcohol/placebo condition in order to further refine the algorithm for MJ impairment detection such that fNIRS detection concurs with field sobriety testing with >90% specificity. It is anticipated that this level of specificity could be used in legal definitions of impairment. This will warrant commercialization, which will be followed by prototype development and field testing. An accurate, quantitative, biological test that is user-friendly and enables law enforcement to detect impairment from MJ has the potential to dramatically change practice of law enforcement across the country and the world and thus has enormous commercial potential, as outlined in the Commercialization Plan and in accompanying letters of support. The goal of this project is to develop, test, and refine a method to accurately and reliably detect marijuana (MJ) impairment using a portable, user-friendly, non-invasive, brain-based modality. MJ doubles the chance of motor vehicle accidents, yet, there now exists no valid, biologically based method to detect whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ. The development of a reliable, quantitative biological marker that enables law enforcement officers to screen individuals whom they suspect are impaired from MJ will have highly significant public health importance and enormous commercial potential.",Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication,9334516,R42DA043977,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Body Fluids', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breath Tests', 'Cannabis', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Driving While Intoxicated', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Legal', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Oral', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebo Control', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Psychomotor Impairments', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'System', 'THC exposure', 'Testing', 'Tetrahydrocannabinol', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vendor', 'absorption', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'behavior test', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'density', 'detector', 'driving under influence', 'drug testing', 'field sobriety tests', 'field study', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'interest', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vehicular accident']",NIDA,"HIGHLIGHTI, INC",R42,2017,224973,0.015026636339081158
"Automatic Positioning of Communication Devices and other Essential Equipment for People with Mobility Restrictions Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users’ independence by responding to them without another person’s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user’s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user’s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale. Project Narrative People who are essentially quadriplegic, with significant mobility impairments and limited to no upper extremity use, are dependent on others to maintain proper positioning for access to devices essential for their health, mobility and communication, such as eye gaze speech devices, call systems, phones, tablets, wheelchair controls, and hydration and suctioning tubes. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision to detect specific targets, such as facial features, to control a robotic mounting and positioning system; automatically repositioning devices for best access without assistance from others, even when their position changes.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9341305,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'portability', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,166794,0.012165780447416613
"Active Power Exoskeleton Device for Spinal Cord Injury ! ABSTRACT Significance: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) cause costly and morbid chronic conditions such as lack of voluntary movement, increased chance of pressure sores, problematic spasticity, loss of bowel, bladder, and sexual function, and more physical impairments which result in a lower quality of life and lack of independence. Approximately 285,000 people in the U.S. have SCI with ~17,000 new patients added each year. Current treatment options include an array of electrical stimulation interventions or high-intensity fitness regimens, but all share one common limitation of being episodic in their treatment delivery. There is a compelling need for a treatment option that can be used daily, improves Activities of Daily Living (ADL’s), allows for in- home rehab and most importantly provides patient independence. Enabling technology exists, often proven in other medical device applications, that can facilitate the design of an upper limb orthotic system to deliver the functional performance required by SCI patients. The OlympEX Medical Actively Powered Exoskeleton (APEX) device can meet the functional movement requirements, will be designed for in-home use and be affordable to the user. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the APEX orthotic system will achieve clinically meaningful improvement in a SCI patient’s range of motion (ROM) capability to perform ADL’s and to perform upper limb rehab in an in-home setting. Preliminary Work: The APEX orthotic system will be the third generation of orthotic device system to be developed by OlympEX Medical. Generations 1 and 2 are passively powered device systems that have provided the OlympEX design engineering team experience with mechanical apparatus requirements to elevate an upper limb. Likewise, the team has developed capabilities in advanced materials for the body chassis for these devices. The APEX orthotic system evolves from these product platforms to introduce system features in device guidance and user control only obtainable with an actively powered system. Specific Aims: This project entails the APEX hardware/electronic architecture development and the acute pre-clinical evaluation of the system on N=3 patients to evaluate patient safety and device feasibility. In Specific Aim 1 we will design, fabricate and evaluate the APEX mechanical design with electronic architecture. A subset of the APEX functional arm movements will be developed to demonstrate feasibility in performing a limited number of high priority ADL’s. In Specific Aim 2 we will evaluate the performance of this subset of ADL’s on 3 SCI patients. Success criteria will be Pass/Fail as evaluated by clinicians. In addition, an initial patient safety assessment will be completed. Safety factors including discomfort or pain before and after the fitting of the device and no uncontrolled arm movements will be evaluated. Together, these studies will demonstrate the feasibility of APEX device to guide arm movements required to complete ADL’s and therapeutic arm movements in an ambulatory setting. ! Project Narrative Those with cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI) have reduced ability to voluntarily move and use their arms and hands which results in the inability to accomplish many activities of daily living. OlympEX Medical proposes to develop and test an active powered upper extremity exoskeleton to help people with SCI and other neuromuscular conditions with their upper-limb function and rehabilitation. This will improve health, rehabilitative technology, quality of life, and independence for those with SCI.",Active Power Exoskeleton Device for Spinal Cord Injury,9465618,R43HD094440,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Bladder', 'Cervical spinal cord injury', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decubitus ulcer', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Distal', 'Eating', 'Elbow', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Lithium', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regimen', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Safety', 'Sex Functioning', 'Shoulder', 'Source', 'Spastic', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Therapeutic', 'Upper Extremity', 'Voice', 'Weight Gain', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'engineering design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'light weight', 'motor recovery', 'motor rehabilitation', 'operation', 'orthotics', 'patient safety', 'phase 2 study', 'phrases', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'spasticity', 'success', 'volunteer']",NICHD,"ABILITECH MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2017,239802,0.025154286485371415
"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids (HA) that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for HAs, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based on individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one’s ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely can result in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change HA service delivery models yet can be implemented within existing business models and in concert with current practitioners. The ISPS method effectively replaces target-based HA fitting (e.g. NAL-NL2) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. The proposed work follows successful completion of our pilot project and builds upon the research team’s prior research on novel fitting methods for cochlear implant (CI) devices recently acquired by Cochlear, Ltd. Following the successful implementation of ISPS and integration with commercial HA software in the pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility including a field study in which performance outcomes for the ISPS method were as good as a conventional HA fitting method and only took a fraction of the time, despite ISPS having no prior knowledge of patient characteristics and no audiogram. Successful maturation and commercialization of the ISPS technology in Phase II will address several barriers identified in the previous RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure, and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting HAs), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs), and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to HA fitting for patients who tend to avoid professional help). This Phase II project will develop an operational ISPS method by (1) integrating ISPS with hardware/software systems of our industry partners, (2) refine and enhance the ISPS method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of fitting hearing instruments, (3) build support for the use of ISPS in multiple marketplaces, and (4) evaluate the technology through field trials in different service delivery environments by comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase III project will focus on the transition of the technology to support remote and self-fitting of hearing instruments. This project seeks to develop, implement and test a novel automated method for fitting hearing aids based on real-time speech perception performance. This automated approach can improve hearing aid success while significant reducing costs of hearing health care. The automation of the fitting procedure can dramatically increase accessibility of hearing health care.",Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II,9347562,R44DC016249,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Audiology', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Automation', 'Businesses', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Services', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'graph theory', 'health care service', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inclusion criteria', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'software systems', 'sound', 'success']",NIDCD,"SECURBORATION, INC.",R44,2017,758924,-0.05840807513941448
"Environmental Imaging and Control for Exoskeletons to Improve Safety and Mobility Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system to improve the mobility and control of exoskeletons. Recent research has found that 3.86 million Americans require wheelchairs and the number has been increasing annually by an average annual rate of 5.9% per year. While wheelchairs provide freedom, allowing users to be independent as well as reducing dependence upon others, wheelchair use is not physically or emotionally equivalent to walking and is often thought to limit community participation and thus exacerbate social isolation. Robotic exoskeletons/bionic suits have the potential to enable these individuals to stand up and walk, thus providing a way to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society. Our proposal seeks to address one of the hurdles limiting the widespread adoption of exoskeletons in the home and community—the inability of the user to dynamically control gait parameters. This concept has the potential to significantly change the way exoskeletons work and facilitate their adoption into the market. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the proposed solution will provide users a practical way to adjust their suit’s gait to precisely achieve their navigational goals. Specific Aims: Phase I: 1) Build a prototype and Perform Preliminary Laboratory Testing; 2) Develop and Benchmark Algorithms; and 3) Perform Pilot Human Study of Prototype with Exoskeleton Subjects. Phase II: 1) Develop Customized, Production-Ready Hardware and Firmware 2) Integrate with Exoskeleton Control System; and 3) Perform an evaluation of the system through human study testing.

"Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety Project Summary/Abstract Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system for the sensing and control of stand-to-sit motions of a wearable bionics suit. Currently 5.6 million people in the US have impaired mobility from a number of different causes. The primary means of mobility for many of these patients is the wheelchair as it has been for most of the last 50 years. Despite all the benefits introduced by widespread use of the wheelchair, it remains a less than ideal mobility solution. Exoskeleton suits have the potential to empower individuals with impaired mobility with an alternative to wheelchairs that allows them to stand up and walk independently within their home and community has the potential to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society while also further improving their health and quality of life. For exoskeletons to gain acceptance in every-day independent home and community use, many control and safety related functionalities still need to be addressed. Our proposal seeks to address one of the gaps in allowing for independent use of exoskeletons in the home and community, namely, functionality to transition from standing to sitting in a safe manner. The proposed work will provide exoskeleton users with the new ability to independently sit down without assistance and confidence in being able to do so without falling and risking possible injuries. It aims to significantly change the way exoskeletons work thereby facilitating their adoption into the market and directly impacting the lives of individuals with disabilities. Project Narrative Exoskeletons can provide patients with SCI, stroke, and other types of impaired mobility access to extended duration, gravity dependent ambulation that can directly combat the risks associated with physical deconditioning. There are benefits for exoskeleton-use to gain widespread acceptance in every-day, independent home and community settings.

"Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity Project Summary We aim to introduce to the hearing-assistive device industry directional microphones with high signal-to-noise ratio, and the first commercialized microphone that combines all three axes of acoustic pressure gradient onto a single silicon chip. We expect the technology to empower the signal-processing community with a new tool which, when used in conjunction with a conventional omnidirectional microphone, will facilitate new features like ultra-sharp directionality adaptable in real-time by the user and/or artificial intelligence algorithms which scan for desired inputs while filtering out unwanted noise. Directional sensing and the ability to filter out undesirable background acoustic noise are important for those with hearing impairments. Hearing impairment is associated with a loss of fidelity to quiet sounds, while the threshold of pain remains the same. As such, hearing impairment causes a loss of dynamic range or “window” of detectable sound amplitudes. Directional sensing enables preferentially amplifying desired sounds without amplifying background noise. As the first step, we aim to accelerate the commercialization of recently introduced biologically- inspired “rocking” style microphones by synthesizing these designs with integrated, robust piezoelectric readout which is ideal for addressing the low-power, small-size, and high levels of integration required of the hearing-aid industry. Previous work in this field using laboratory prototypes and optical readout have demonstrated the merits of the biologically-inspired sensing approach (i.e. a simultaneous 20-dB SNR improvement and 10x reduction size improvement beyond what is achievable with present-day hearing-aid or MEMS microphones). By synthesizing a piezoelectric embodiment as an alternative to optical readout, we aim to accelerate through many of the commercialization challenges so that an impact to the hearing device industry can be made. Further, the proposed readout is better adapted towards integrating multiple microphones in the same silicon chip. We aim to integrate a microphone with both in-plane axis of directivity with an out-of-plane directional design to form a complete  -axis pressure gradient sensor. Project Narrative Studies show that today 2% of Americans wear a hearing aid, whereas at least 10% of Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device. The major reason for this gap is patient dissatisfaction. Hearing-aid wearers suffer from what is known as the “cocktail party” effect. When the gain is turned up to hear the person speaking across from you, noises in the background are equally amplified – making every scenario sound like a cocktail party. This research aims to make a positive, long-term improvement to hearing-aid patient satisfaction by making commercially available directional microphones with high fidelity.",Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity,9098683,R44DC013746,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Client satisfaction', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Industry', 'Laboratories', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Pain Threshold', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'commercialization', 'design', 'empowered', 'hearing impairment', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,"SILICON AUDIO, INC.",R44,2016,490980,0.011263804187429593
"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation.

"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0(tm) that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud(tm) Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb's DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.        ",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9138555,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2016,750063,0.03343436576946851
"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",9148070,F32EB021159,"['Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Electronics', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Nafion', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Radio Waves', 'Reader', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Silk', 'Skin', 'Sodium', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Sweat', 'Sweating', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Urea', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health', 'bioelectricity', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'enzyme activity', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-invasive monitor', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'real world application', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'saliva composition', 'sensor', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2016,47190,0.010178983470138517

"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization.

"Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes new technology development and user studies aiming to facilitate the use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for blind people. Mobile OCR systems, implemented as smartphones apps, have recently appeared on the market. This technology unleashes the power of modern computer vision algorithms to enable a blind person to hear (via synthetic speech) the content of printed text imaged by the smartphone's camera. Unlike traditional OCR, that requires scanning of a document with a flatbed scanner, mobile OCR apps enable access to text anywhere, anytime. Using their own smartphones, blind people can read store receipts, menus, flyers, business cards, utility bills, and many other printed documents of the type normally encountered in everyday life. Unfortunately, current mobile OCR systems suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem, which limits their usability. They require the user to take a well-framed snapshot of the document to be scanned, with the full text in view, and at a close enough distance that each character can be well resolved and thus readable by the machine. However, taking a good picture of a document is difficult without sight, and thus without the ability to look at the scene being imaged by the camera through the smartphone's screen. Anecdotal evidence, supported by results of preliminary studies conducted by the principal investigator's group, confirms that acquisition of an OCR-readable image of a document can indeed by very challenging for some blind users. We plan to address this problem by developing and testing a new technique of assisted mobile OCR. As the user aims the camera at the document, the system analyzes in real time the stream of images acquired by the camera, and determines how the camera position and orientation should be adjusted so that an OCR-readable image of the document can be acquired. This information is conveyed to the user via a specially designed acoustic signal. This acoustic feedback allows users to quickly adjust and reorient the camera or the document, resulting in reduced access time and in more satisfactory user experience. Multiple user studies with blind participants are planned with the purpose of selecting an appropriate acoustic interface and of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed assisted mobile OCR modality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is concerned with the development of new technology designed to facilitate use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems to access printed text without sight. Specifically, this exploratory research will develop and test a novel system that, by means of a specially designed acoustic interface, will help a blind person take a well-framed, well-resolved image of a document for OCR processing using a smartphone or wearable camera. If successful, this novel approach to assisted mobile OCR will reduce access time and improve user experience of blind mobile OCR users.",Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR,8989105,R21EY025077,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Augmented Reality', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chickens', 'Clothing', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Marketing', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Report (document)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Restaurants', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Development Study', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'blind', 'design', 'egg', 'experience', 'handicapping condition', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'optical character recognition', 'research study', 'technology development', 'usability', 'way finding']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2016,230563,-0.03260564458064498
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9133378,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall injury', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,166809,0.012165780447416613
"Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. Detection of autism early is crucial but accurate screening tools have been elusive. In Phase II, a practical method of improving accuracy of M-CHAT, the most widely used autism screen, was created by adapting the validated and recommended follow up interview, M-CHAT F/Ui (F/U), for efficient use during the visit. In the case of a positive screen, the primary care provider (PCP) can use CHADIS, a web-based questionnaire delivery, decision support and post-visit engagement system, to conduct F/U rather than requiring a visit with another professional. Phase II data showed F/U results by a PCP were equivalent to the autism center. Phase-II data on the M-CHAT plus F/U via CHADIS replicated findings of the F/U authors in showing both excellent positive predictive value (PPV) 0.96 for children >20 months (thus effective for 24 month olds) and also low PPV 0.54 for <20 months. Promisingly, Phase II exploratory analyses using a decision tree including supplementary data from a routinely used standard language screen (ASQ communication scale) and an item from a language measure (MCDI) plus the standard autism screen (M-CHAT plus F/U) reached PPV of 0.95 in the <20 month group. This screen completion could be done efficiently online by parents. Phase IIB plans a replication of this screening procedure which promises to be accurate for 18 month olds and comparison to alternatives using the community network of >400 Maryland doctors where >22,000 autism screens have been done using the CHADIS system. A more accurate screening test is of less value if it is not universally used. In Phase II, an approach was developed that reduces disparities in access to screening using a ""talking"" tablet kiosk that was preferred by parents to alternatives, but further workflow issues will be addressed in Phase IIB. To improve screen completion, we will program an automated reminder/completion confirmation text/email system in CHADIS with coupons as incentives for parents. In Phase II, CHADIS was adapted to capture both patient input and doctor decision-making and Maintenance of Certification (MOC) accreditation was awarded by the American Board of Pediatrics for this program and earned by 140 pediatricians. This monthly doctor quality improvement program will be extended to a daily continuous quality improvement process for the whole office team to further assure patient participation in screening while providing other clinical and financial analytics of value to the office. The Phase-IIB goal is to develop and test an innovative ""screening system"" not just a new test. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. In Phase I, a standard screening procedure was adapted so that doctors could efficiently identify autistic children at two years of age but the screen did not prove accurate at 18 months. Phase II data showed that a novel method combining supplemental information and a new computerized scoring pathway promised accurate detection at the critical 18 month age. This Phase 2B proposal is aimed at replicating this unique approach to early autism identification in a community sample, comparing it with alternatives plus developing innovative strategies to assure that all children are screened by automating reminders and completion confirmation and by supporting continuous quality improvement in office implementation using automated reporting analytics.",Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening,9070770,R44MH085399,"['Academy', 'Accreditation', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Certification', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Maintenance', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Visit', 'autistic children', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'computerized', 'disparity reduction', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'screening', 'tool']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2016,796080,-0.007343997513711917
"Environmental Imaging and Control for Exoskeletons to Improve Safety and Mobility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system to improve the mobility and control of exoskeletons. Recent research has found that 3.86 million Americans require wheelchairs and the number has been increasing annually by an average annual rate of 5.9% per year. While wheelchairs provide freedom, allowing users to be independent as well as reducing dependence upon others, wheelchair use is not physically or emotionally equivalent to walking and is often thought to limit community participation and thus exacerbate social isolation. Robotic exoskeletons/bionic suits have the potential to enable these individuals to stand up and walk, thus providing a way to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society. Our proposal seeks to address one of the hurdles limiting the widespread adoption of exoskeletons in the home and community-the inability of the user to dynamically control gait parameters. This concept has the potential to significantly change the way exoskeletons work and facilitate their adoption into the market. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the proposed solution will provide users a practical way to adjust their suit's gait to precisely achieve their navigational goals.

Meta-studies can support (or refute) interventions, spur new investigations, and lead to novel clinical guidelines. However, constructing meta-studies is a time intensive process of searching the literature, compiling the results, and performing the statistical analysis. Due to the time commitment that is required, many topics are unexplored, and many meta-studies are not kept up-to-date with the latest published results. Finally, a number of (unknown) biases, via subjective choices during the meta-study, may influence the results. Our long-term goal is to automate, as much as possible, the meta-study process. This should decrease subjective bias; increase the dissemination of evidence, especially for diseases and interventions that receive less attention; and allow for the automatic updating of meta-studies as new results are published. We propose a computer system that uses statistical machine learning to gather and group studies focused on similar interventions and outcomes; extract the necessary results from the text; and analyze the results using standard meta-analysis techniques. The final output will be presented in a spreadsheet-like Web-interface where users can explore and even change the data and meta-analyses. Our team uniquely blends technical expertise in machine learning with leadership in publishing meta-studies about Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), our disease of focus for our Phase I feasibility study. We are therefore qualified technically and able to ensure that the techniques generate valid and accurate meta-studies. Our Phase I results will define the current state-of-the-art for this novel task. Further, although we will initially focus n IBD, our Phase I results will demonstrate that our approach can generalize to other diseases, eventually applying to any intervention and any disease. The feasibility shown by our Phase I results will motivate our Phase II effort where we will focus on dramatically improving the approach, yielding broad coverage of all medical literature and generating human-quality meta-studies. We note that by the end of Phase I we should have a viable end-to-end prototype, focused on IBD, which we can begin taking to market. The final product should significantly benefit our target markets given the Phase II emphasis to improve the technology, user experience, and scope of covered diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A meta-analysis collects and analyzes the results from multiple studies that are all focused on the same topic, and it can confirm (or refute) the overall effect across the studies, lead to changes in clinical guidelines, or spur new directions for research. However, generating a meta-analysis is an extremely time-consuming process, so many diseases are not covered, and most meta-analyses are not updated to reflect the latest published studies. This work begins to automate the process of creating meta-analyses, overcoming these difficulties in order to make the results published in the medical literature more accessible.",Automatically Creating and Updating Meta-Studies of Randomized Controlled Trials,8977531,R43LM012210,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dourine', 'Ensure', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'prototype', 'software development', 'text searching', 'web interface']",NLM,INFERLINK CORPORATION,R43,2015,150000,0.02009918538669418
"Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity Project Summary We aim to introduce to the hearing-assistive device industry directional microphones with high signal-to-noise ratio, and the first commercialized microphone that combines all three axes of acoustic pressure gradient onto a single silicon chip. We expect the technology to empower the signal-processing community with a new tool which, when used in conjunction with a conventional omnidirectional microphone, will facilitate new features like ultra-sharp directionality adaptable in real-time by the user and/or artificial intelligence algorithms which scan for desired inputs while filtering out unwanted noise. Directional sensing and the ability to filter out undesirable background acoustic noise are important for those with hearing impairments. Hearing impairment is associated with a loss of fidelity to quiet sounds, while the threshold of pain remains the same. As such, hearing impairment causes a loss of dynamic range or “window” of detectable sound amplitudes. Directional sensing enables preferentially amplifying desired sounds without amplifying background noise. As the first step, we aim to accelerate the commercialization of recently introduced biologically- inspired “rocking” style microphones by synthesizing these designs with integrated, robust piezoelectric readout which is ideal for addressing the low-power, small-size, and high levels of integration required of the hearing-aid industry. Previous work in this field using laboratory prototypes and optical readout have demonstrated the merits of the biologically-inspired sensing approach (i.e. a simultaneous 20-dB SNR improvement and 10x reduction size improvement beyond what is achievable with present-day hearing-aid or MEMS microphones). By synthesizing a piezoelectric embodiment as an alternative to optical readout, we aim to accelerate through many of the commercialization challenges so that an impact to the hearing device industry can be made. Further, the proposed readout is better adapted towards integrating multiple microphones in the same silicon chip. We aim to integrate a microphone with both in-plane axis of directivity with an out-of-plane directional design to form a complete  -axis pressure gradient sensor. Project Narrative Studies show that today 2% of Americans wear a hearing aid, whereas at least 10% of Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device. The major reason for this gap is patient dissatisfaction. Hearing-aid wearers suffer from what is known as the “cocktail party” effect. When the gain is turned up to hear the person speaking across from you, noises in the background are equally amplified – making every scenario sound like a cocktail party. This research aims to make a positive, long-term improvement to hearing-aid patient satisfaction by making commercially available directional microphones with high fidelity.",Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity,8981015,R44DC013746,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Client satisfaction', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Industry', 'Laboratories', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Pain Threshold', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'commercialization', 'design', 'empowered', 'hearing impairment', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,"SILICON AUDIO, INC.",R44,2015,508997,0.011263804187429593
"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation. Determination of their sequence structures will allow better understanding of how organisms control these physiological events through glycosaminoglycans.            ",Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores,8984813,R21GM118339,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Glycobiology', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imidazole', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocyte Trafficking', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mammals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trisaccharides', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional group', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'polysulfated glycosaminoglycan', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'stem', 'sugar', 'sulfation', 'tool']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2015,273816,-0.01189543300357506

"Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive medical devices are fast emerging as powerful tools in providing quantitative, simple to parse data in assessing the health and wellness of users. These devices can provide information feedback to users on their state of health, and can potentially provide valuable real-time insight to doctors on the links between user consumption and activity on their respective health. Recently described epidermal electronics / multifunctional tattoos introduced from our lab and others have demonstrated sensing of biopressure, bioelectricity, analyte concentration, bacteria, and more. These structures potentially represent the evolution of wearable devices as they possess a negligible form factor and conform to any surface (such as skin or teeth), minimizing user impact. These devices also bypass more traditional, ""wearable"" gadgets that often require bulky mechanical fixtures or straps, require complex microfluidic systems or integrated electronics, cannot provide dynamic readout, and cannot be disposed of easily. Dielectric sensors are a class of structures that are able to probe the composition of a biofluid via their impedance spectrum, and can be configured for remote sensing via radio waves. These devices can be composed of isolated, thin film circuits, and are directly amenable to epidermal or tattoo formats. This measurement methodology is inherently tremendously powerful, as it can potentially measure multiple analytes at once by probing multiple resonance peaks, and can potentially be piggybacked onto existing RFID infrastructure for data readout. However, these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated, and under real-world applications dielectric sensors have often proven difficult to use. This is often due to simplistic readout (devices will directly correlate a single metric such s the real value of the impedance at a frequency to a biomarker) and are thus can be sensitive from user to user or to environmental conditions. Herein, the applicant will leverage the expertise and knowledge of the labs of Dr. Omenetto and colleagues to bring practical usability to these dielectric antennas, bridging the gap between laboratory measurement and real-time, and real-world health monitoring applications. The end-goal is to generate disposable, skin and teeth-mounted, dielectric sensors to remotely probe the presence of biomarkers in sweat, saliva, and potentially blood to draw definitive links between user nutrition and their health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to create non-invasive, wireless sensor tattoos to be tagged onto the human body for probing the composition of saliva, sweat, or blood. These wireless sensors would present negligible impediment to the user, and would require next to no upkeep to maintain, potentially facilitating an unprecedented level of subject data collection and dissemination. Such data could yield conclusive links between diet, activity, biomarkers, and public health.            ","Development of epidermal, wireless sensor tattoos for non-invasive monitoring of biofluid composition",8980210,F32EB021159,"['Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Electronics', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Nafion', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Radio', 'Radio Waves', 'Reader', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Silk', 'Skin', 'Sodium', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Sweat', 'Sweating', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Urea', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health', 'bioelectricity', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'enzyme activity', 'flexibility', 'glucose monitor', 'improved', 'insight', 'non-invasive monitor', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'real world application', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'saliva composition', 'sensor', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,F32,2015,56042,0.010178983470138517
"Unassisted Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Arterial Tonometry and Photoplethysmography ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a tonometry based solution to the problem of inexpensive, unencumbering and non- invasive measurement of blood pressure. The proposed solution will be useful in clinical as well as ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Specifically, we propose to develop a large (1cm x 5cm) two-dimensional array of pressure sensors with 0.2mm spacing (24x128 pressure-sensing elements), together with robust signal processing algorithms with a feedback controlled band-tightening mechanism in order to measure blood pressure at the wrist. The pressure sensor array together with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor will be embedded in a band, and will provide signals through a multiplexed circuit designed. Signal conditioning techniques will be used to get the large amount of data in the form that can be efficiently processed on a microcontroller. The proposed two-dimensional array of pressure sensors will be built using flexible plastic and micro-fabrication techniques. The increased size of the sensor array will ensure proper contact and pressure application with arteries in the wrist for tonometric measurement of BP. The signals generated from the sensor array will be processed through advanced signal processing and optimization techniques to handle the huge amount of data and to mitigate noise. The PPG signals will be used at the wrist to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system. The sensor array system will be embodied in the form of a band, which will be integrated in a wearable device such as smartwatch. The capabilities of the smartwatch will be used for data processing and analytics. a) Design, develop, and test a two-dimensional pressure sensor array on a polyimide flexible substrate b) Process large amount of analog data from sensor array using signal conditioning and processing techniques  to generate blood pressure estimates c) Design a user friendly prototype form factor, and perform a clinical trial to validate device performance  The engineering members of our multidisciplinary team have specialized in cardiac instrumentation, signal and image processing for medical applications, pressure and touch sensors, signal processing and robust optimization.

"Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral venous access is pivotal to a wide range of clinical interventions and is consequently the leading cause of medical injury in the U.S. Complications associated with the procedure are exacerbated in difficult settings, where the rate of success depends heavily on the patient's physiology and the practitioner's experience. My dissertation thesis pertains to the development of imaging and robotic technologies to improve the accuracy and speed of blood draws and IV's. The core technology is an image-guided robotic device that accurately and autonomously introduces a cannula for venous access. The device operates by mapping in real-time the 3D structure of peripheral veins in order to robotically direct a needle into a selected vein. A working prototype has been developed and validated in several studies, the results of which are described in two journal publications. The device combines a 3D near-infrared vein imager, a robot, and computer vision software; these three components form the basis of the three Specific Aims described in this proposal. The Aims fit into the overall dissertation by 1) incorporating the current imaging hardware into a standalone, handheld imaging device; 2) introducing software for the imaging device that assists in selecting suitable cannulation sites; and 3) integrating the imaging device and software with a miniaturized version of the current robot. The outcome of this work will be a compact and low-cost system that is suited for beta-stage development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood draws and IV therapies are one of the most commonly performed medical routines in hospitals and clinics. Injuries to doctors and patients happen frequently because of how difficult it can be to find veins and accurately insert the needle. We are developing a portable and lightweight medical robot to perform the procedure in situations where the doctor is unable to successfully access the veins. This device may greatly improve the safety and accuracy of venous access, and has wide applications in many clinical areas.","Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea",8832591,F31EB018191,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood', 'Cannulas', 'Cannulations', 'Catheters', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Emergency Care', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Motivation', 'Needles', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Sprague-Dawley Rats', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'image guided', 'imaging software', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'robotic device', 'skeletal', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F31,2015,32250,0.021644392424056007
"Enabling access to printed text for blind people via assisted mobile OCR     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes new technology development and user studies aiming to facilitate the use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for blind people. Mobile OCR systems, implemented as smartphones apps, have recently appeared on the market. This technology unleashes the power of modern computer vision algorithms to enable a blind person to hear (via synthetic speech) the content of printed text imaged by the smartphone's camera. Unlike traditional OCR, that requires scanning of a document with a flatbed scanner, mobile OCR apps enable access to text anywhere, anytime. Using their own smartphones, blind people can read store receipts, menus, flyers, business cards, utility bills, and many other printed documents of the type normally encountered in everyday life. Unfortunately, current mobile OCR systems suffer from a chicken-and-egg problem, which limits their usability. They require the user to take a well-framed snapshot of the document to be scanned, with the full text in view, and at a close enough distance that each character can be well resolved and thus readable by the machine. However, taking a good picture of a document is difficult without sight, and thus without the ability to look at the scene being imaged by the camera through the smartphone's screen. Anecdotal evidence, supported by results of preliminary studies conducted by the principal investigator's group, confirms that acquisition of an OCR-readable image of a document can indeed by very challenging for some blind users. We plan to address this problem by developing and testing a new technique of assisted mobile OCR. As the user aims the camera at the document, the system analyzes in real time the stream of images acquired by the camera, and determines how the camera position and orientation should be adjusted so that an OCR-readable image of the document can be acquired. This information is conveyed to the user via a specially designed acoustic signal. This acoustic feedback allows users to quickly adjust and reorient the camera or the document, resulting in reduced access time and in more satisfactory user experience. Multiple user studies with blind participants are planned with the purpose of selecting an appropriate acoustic interface and of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed assisted mobile OCR modality.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application is concerned with the development of new technology designed to facilitate use of mobile Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems to access printed text without sight.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8898070,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,164698,0.012165780447416613
"Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bruin Biometrics' proposes to develop the Joint Health Monitor (JHM), an innovative low risk device capable of detecting artificial joint implant failure prior to all currently available diagnostic devices. Artificial joint replacements have demonstrated excellent clinical performance. However, failures do occur due to a multitude of factors including, aseptic loosening, wear, dislocation, osteolysis, and adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR), including pseudotumors and extensive tissue damage. Recent catastrophic failures associated with specific implant designs, and increasing concern over the severe clinical consequences of ALTR, have raised the attention of both consumer advocacy groups and regulatory agencies, in the US and abroad. It is evident that current diagnostic tools have failed to predict early enough complications associated with some implant designs and/or patient's characteristics. Rather than be predictive, current diagnostic methods usually do not detect joint degradation until bone and tissue damage have already occurred, increasing morbidity, mortality and severity of revision surgeries. Bruin Biometrics has developed an innovative monitoring device that will allow effective monitoring of an artificial joint functionality and eary detection of at risk patients, implant designs and reduction of the number or at least the severity of revision surgeries. Early detection should also enable physicians to prescribe exercise regimens, dietary supplements, medication, early revision surgery or other measures to protect against further damage. Moreover, the existence of an effective monitoring device would provide invaluable feedback, enabling unprecedented quantification and evaluation of treatment efficacy including drugs. The objectives of this proposal are to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this device to detect specific failure modes. This will be accomplished using an in vitro test rig set up and an in vivo human subject pilot study. Our overall goal is to rapidly delier a wearable system capable of monitoring the status of artificial joints and provide surgeons with more accurate and earlier diagnoses.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Hip and Knee replacement procedures will continue to increase dramatically over the next twenty years and the rate of revision surgery is expected to remain stable around 17-18%. This will increase the burden on orthopaedic surgeons, operating room capacity, and healthcare cost. In 2007 dollars, this volume of total joint replacement would generate costs exceeding $100 billion, or 1% of the gross domestic product (GDP). If successful, the new monitoring device object of this proposal named ""Joint Health Monitor"" will have an immediate impact on managing joint degradation, reducing complicated revision surgeries and allowing more effective patient surveillance avoiding catastrophic failure; this in turn will increase patient confidence in regulatory agencies and industry.            ",Rapid Detection of Common Failure Modes for Knee Prosthetics,8906609,R43AR067048,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arithmetic', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Bone Tissue', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumer Advocacy', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Dislocations', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hip region structure', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Prosthesis', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteolysis', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Radiation', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trust', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adverse outcome', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'follow-up', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'human subject', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'rapid detection', 'sample fixation', 'tool']",NIAMS,"BRUIN BIOMETRICS, LLC",R43,2015,149685,0.0045948018074141615
"Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this SBIR project is to develop a new tool to improve the ability of blind and visually impaired people to quickly get to the right web pages, to avoid ending up on the wrong web pages, and to reach the desired part of each web page efficiently. The motivation for this effort is that getting a 'big picture' understanding of a web page is one of the biggest challenges facing this population of computer users. Existing tools for blind and visually impaired people, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, present the entire web page serially, in full detail, either by textual output of the details, or b providing a magnified view of a small part of the page. However, if the user is not already familiar with the website, the resulting lack of context requires a laborious and time-consuming process to scan through sometimes hundreds of details before knowing whether anything of interest even exists on the page in question. In contrast, the proposed technology analyzes web pages in a similar way that sighted users quickly scan pages before reading in detail, to provide a succinct, informative guidance on the context and layout of the page, so that a user quickly gains a much richer ""big-picture"" understanding. The proposed Phase II project builds on a successful Phase I user evaluation of a proof- of-concept of the software, in which users expressed a strong preference for the contextual cues provided by the approach. Phase II includes creating a fully-functional prototype of the software tool. Throughout the technology development, feedback from users and practitioners will guide the path of the R&D for maximum usability. At the conclusion of Phase II, an end-user, in-home evaluation study will verify the effectiveness of the tool, providing the starting point for full-scale commercialization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The R&D in this Phase II SBIR project will result in an improved way to use the Internet for individuals with visual disabilities. The technology will help to overcome the lack of accessibility and high level of frustration currently found among blind and visually impaired users. The results of the project will enable such individuals to explore new opportunities and be more productive, thus providing improved employment potential and an increase in the quality of life.",Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with,8795182,R44EY020082,"['Advertisements', 'Area', 'Arizona', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Boxing', 'Characteristics', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Effectiveness', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Generations', 'Government', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interest Group', 'Internet', 'Literature', 'Marketing', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'base', 'blind', 'commercialization', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'natural language', 'phrases', 'preference', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'technology development', 'tool', 'usability', 'web page', 'web site']",NEI,"VORTANT TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2015,195445,0.0029945987074148617
"Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. Detection of autism early is crucial but accurate screening tools have been elusive. In Phase II, a practical method of improving accuracy of M-CHAT, the most widely used autism screen, was created by adapting the validated and recommended follow up interview, M-CHAT F/Ui (F/U), for efficient use during the visit. In the case of a positive screen, the primary care provider (PCP) can use CHADIS, a web-based questionnaire delivery, decision support and post-visit engagement system, to conduct F/U rather than requiring a visit with another professional. Phase II data showed F/U results by a PCP were equivalent to the autism center. Phase-II data on the M-CHAT plus F/U via CHADIS replicated findings of the F/U authors in showing both excellent positive predictive value (PPV) 0.96 for children >20 months (thus effective for 24 month olds) and also low PPV 0.54 for <20 months. Promisingly, Phase II exploratory analyses using a decision tree including supplementary data from a routinely used standard language screen (ASQ communication scale) and an item from a language measure (MCDI) plus the standard autism screen (M-CHAT plus F/U) reached PPV of 0.95 in the <20 month group. This screen completion could be done efficiently online by parents. Phase IIB plans a replication of this screening procedure which promises to be accurate for 18 month olds and comparison to alternatives using the community network of >400 Maryland doctors where >22,000 autism screens have been done using the CHADIS system. A more accurate screening test is of less value if it is not universally used. In Phase II, an approach was developed that reduces disparities in access to screening using a ""talking"" tablet kiosk that was preferred by parents to alternatives, but further workflow issues will be addressed in Phase IIB. To improve screen completion, we will program an automated reminder/completion confirmation text/email system in CHADIS with coupons as incentives for parents. In Phase II, CHADIS was adapted to capture both patient input and doctor decision-making and Maintenance of Certification (MOC) accreditation was awarded by the American Board of Pediatrics for this program and earned by 140 pediatricians. This monthly doctor quality improvement program will be extended to a daily continuous quality improvement process for the whole office team to further assure patient participation in screening while providing other clinical and financial analytics of value to the office. The Phase-IIB goal is to develop and test an innovative ""screening system"" not just a new test. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. In Phase I, a standard screening procedure was adapted so that doctors could efficiently identify autistic children at two years of age but the screen did not prove accurate at 18 months. Phase II data showed that a novel method combining supplemental information and a new computerized scoring pathway promised accurate detection at the critical 18 month age. This Phase 2B proposal is aimed at replicating this unique approach to early autism identification in a community sample, comparing it with alternatives plus developing innovative strategies to assure that all children are screened by automating reminders and completion confirmation and by supporting continuous quality improvement in office implementation using automated reporting analytics.",Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening,8894598,R44MH085399,"['Academy', 'Accreditation', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Certification', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Maintenance', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Visit', 'autistic children', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'screening', 'tool']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2015,796060,-0.007343997513711917
"Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity  Project Summary We aim to introduce to the hearing-assistive device industry the first commercialized microphone that combines all three axes of acoustic pressure gradient onto a single silicon chip. We expect the technology to empower the signal-processing community with a new tool which, when used in conjunction with a conventional omnidirectional microphone, will facilitate new features like ultra-sharp directionality adaptable in real-time by the user and/or artificial intelligence algorithms which scan for desired inputs while filtering out unwanted noise. Directional sensing and the ability to filter out undesirable background acoustic noise are important for those with hearing impairments. Hearing impairment is associated with a loss of fidelity to quiet sounds, while the threshold of pain remains the same. As such, hearing impairment causes a loss of dynamic range or ""window"" of detectable sound amplitudes. Directional sensing enables preferentially amplifying desired sounds without amplifying background noise. As the first step, we aim to accelerate the commercialization of recently introduced biologically- inspired ""rocking"" style microphones by synthesizing these designs with integrated, robust piezoelectric readout which is ideal for addressing the low-power, small-size, and high levels of integration required of the hearing-aid industry. Previous work in this field using laboratory prototypes and optical readout have demonstrated the merits of the biologically-inspired sensing approach (i.e. a simultaneous 20-dB SNR improvement and 10x reduction size improvement beyond what is achievable with present-day hearing-aid or MEMS microphones). By synthesizing a piezoelectric embodiment as an alternative to optical readout, we aim to accelerate through many of the commercialization challenges so that an impact to the hearing device industry can be made. Further, the proposed readout is better adapted towards integrating multiple microphones in the same silicon chip. In Phase II, we aim to integrate a microphone with both in-plane axis of directivity with an out-of-plane directional design to form a complete 3-axis pressure gradient sensor. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Studies show that today 2% of Americans wear a hearing aid, whereas at least 10% of Americans could benefit from a hearing assistive device. The major reason for this gap is patient dissatisfaction. Hearing-aid wearers suffer from what is known as the ""cocktail party"" effect. When the gain is turned up to hear the person speaking across from you, noises in the background are equally amplified - making every scenario sound like a cocktail party. This research aims to make a positive, long-term improvement to hearing-aid patient satisfaction by making commercially available directional microphones with high fidelity.            ",Micromachined microphones with in-plane and out-of-plane directivity,8648777,R43DC013746,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Client satisfaction', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Microfabrication', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Pain Threshold', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'commercialization', 'design', 'empowered', 'hearing impairment', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,"SILICON AUDIO, INC.",R43,2014,149828,0.02055637654130166
"Automating Directly Observed Therapy as a Platform Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction: Ai Cure Technologies LLC was established in 2009 to develop automated medication adherence monitoring solutions using computer vision technology. This SBIR Phase II will allow Ai Cure Technologies to test the accuracy and validity of its flagship product, AiView"". The SBIR Phase I demonstrated that the AiView"" platform was technically feasible and capable of confirming medication administration. Significance: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice. The inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounds the problem. Clinical trials depend on people taking the drug being tested. The problem of medication adherence has been addressed - determinants of adherence are being studied and new monitoring methods developed - but no solution has been able to accurately confirm real-time medication adherence while also being affordable, flexible, and likable. The Product: Ai Cure Technologies will provide an automated DOT (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam- enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. AiView"" will visually track and confirm medication administration without human supervision. Long-Term Goal: The AiView"" system will combine sophisticated computer vision technology with the best attributes of DOT for 1/400th of the cost. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects' rates of compliance and allow them to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance. Phase II hypothesis: AiView"" can be used to accurately measure and improve medication adherence across different patient populations, and positively impact self-perception and clinical outcomes. Specific Aim #1: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can accurately measure and improve medication adherence in a depression and a stroke patient population. Specific Aim #2: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can improve self-perception and improve clinical outcomes in the AiView"" intervention groups Expected Outcome: The patients in the AiView"" intervention groups (depression and stroke) are expected to have statistically significant higher adherence rates than those in the pill counting groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice with the inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounding the problem. In accordance with this SBIR Phase II grant, Ai Cure Technologies will continue development and testing of its Automated DOTSM (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam-enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration.

"Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral venous access is pivotal to a wide range of clinical interventions and is consequently the leading cause of medical injury in the U.S. Complications associated with the procedure are exacerbated in difficult settings, where the rate of success depends heavily on the patient's physiology and the practitioner's experience. My dissertation thesis pertains to the development of imaging and robotic technologies to improve the accuracy and speed of blood draws and IV's. The core technology is an image-guided robotic device that accurately and autonomously introduces a cannula for venous access. The device operates by mapping in real-time the 3D structure of peripheral veins in order to robotically direct a needle into a selected vein. A working prototype has been developed and validated in several studies, the results of which are described in two journal publications. The device combines a 3D near-infrared vein imager, a robot, and computer vision software; these three components form the basis of the three Specific Aims described in this proposal. The Aims fit into the overall dissertation by 1) incorporating the current imaging hardware into a standalone, handheld imaging device; 2) introducing software for the imaging device that assists in selecting suitable cannulation sites; and 3) integrating the imaging device and software with a miniaturized version of the current robot. The outcome of this work will be a compact and low-cost system that is suited for beta-stage development.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood draws and IV therapies are one of the most commonly performed medical routines in hospitals and clinics. Injuries to doctors and patients happen frequently because of how difficult it can be to find veins and accurately insert the needle. We are developing a portable and lightweight medical robot to perform the procedure in situations where the doctor is unable to successfully access the veins. This device may greatly improve the safety and accuracy of venous access, and has wide applications in many clinical areas.            ","Low-Cost, Compact, and Portable Robot for Autonomous Intravenous Access using Nea",8718641,F31EB018191,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood', 'Cannulas', 'Cannulations', 'Catheters', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Emergency Care', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Motivation', 'Needles', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Sprague-Dawley Rats', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'meetings', 'miniaturize', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'robotic device', 'skeletal', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",F31,2014,34424,0.021644392424056007

Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.            ",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8738041,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Simulate', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2014,180608,0.012165780447416613
"Development of a Centralized Intelligence and Control AP Hub Device ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite major advances in pharmaceuticals and medical device technology, the ability to safely and effectively control blood glucose in patients with Type 1 diabetes has remained a recalcitrant challenge and a significant source of human suffering and economic cost. With the advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), increasing effort has been focused on the development of artificial pancreas (AP) systems using CGM coupled with insulin pump via closed-loop control (CLC) algorithms. Integration of these disparate technologies and implementation in a commercial product has faced numerous challenges to date. TypeZero Technologies' objective is the commercialization of the robust and extensively tested Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) software platform and supporting technology into a commercial-grade device ""hub"" designed to organize and control a network of medical devices for the improved management of blood glucose in the context of Type 1 diabetes. The DiAs prototype has been extensively tested to date, and has generated over 24,000 hours of on- patient data. In numerous clinical trials, this technology has reduced dramatically the frequency of occurrence of severe hyper- and hypoglycemic events, reduced glycemic variability and improved patient's ""time-in-range"" (rate of euglycemia). DiAs and supporting technologies represent the core elements of a radically different treatment paradigm that integrates and maximizes the capabilities of existing and currently approved medical devices with a proprietary software platform and control technologies. The key characteristics of the TypeZero hub are:  "" Modular hub functionality residing optionally within and across available networked devices including the  patient's pump, meter, CGM, smartphone, or within cloud services;  "" Ability to accommodate any control strategy that is deemed optimal for a specific patient;  "" Inherently layered architecture, designed with an upward pathway of sequential module deployment;  "" Inherent safety, featuring a downward pathway of graceful degradation to a known system state in the  event of component failure; and  "" Local and Global modes of operation enabling the availability of certain processes and patient  interaction through the portable device; other services and remote monitoring of subject and system  state are available via telecommunication (e.g. 3G, WiFi, etc.). We envision that in the near future consumer electronics hardware equipped with appropriate software (e.g. DiAs) would gradually replace specialized CGM receivers or insulin pump controllers, merging into a single ultra-portable platform the functions of continuous monitoring, insulin delivery, and closed-loop control. In the near-term, we envision creating a dedicated hub controller that will host key functionalities of artificial pancreas as a critical step toward the future.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The persistent challenge of safely and effectively managing blood glucose levels in the context of Type 1 diabetes indicates the inadequacy of currently approved and available medical device technologies. Artificial pancreas approaches to algorithm-based control of medical devices for improved patient safety and outcomes has been an active area of research for many years. TypeZero Technologies seeks to commercialize a proprietary suite of technologies that have been developed and extensively tested in clinical trial settings and shown to deliver significant improvements in safety and efficacy. The successful development of TypeZero's hub device will represent a novel integration of capabilities that will dramatically accelerate the commercial availability of artificial pancreas technologies.        ",Development of a Centralized Intelligence and Control AP Hub Device,8823176,R43DK104293,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Continuous Infusion', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Failure', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intelligence', 'Judgment', 'Kidney Failure', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuropathy', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transition Elements', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'design', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'meter', 'middleware', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'safety testing', 'subcutaneous']",NIDDK,"TYPEZERO TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2014,224354,-0.029690676014305827
"Context Understanding Technology to improve internet accessibility for users with DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this SBIR project is to develop a new tool to improve the ability of blind and visually impaired people to quickly get to the right web pages, to avoid ending up on the wrong web pages, and to reach the desired part of each web page efficiently. The motivation for this effort is that getting a 'big picture' understanding of a  web page is one of the biggest challenges facing this population of computer users. Existing tools for blind and visually impaired people, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, present the entire web page serially, in full detail, either by textual output of the details, or b providing a magnified view of a small part of the page. However, if the user is not already familiar with the website, the resulting lack of context requires a laborious and time-consuming process to scan through sometimes hundreds of details before knowing whether anything of interest even exists on the page in question. In contrast, the proposed technology analyzes web pages in a similar way that sighted users quickly scan pages before reading in detail, to provide a succinct, informative guidance on the context and layout of the page, so that a user quickly gains a much richer ""big-picture"" understanding. The proposed Phase II project builds on a successful Phase I user evaluation of a proof- of-concept of the software, in which users expressed a strong preference for the contextual cues provided by the approach. Phase II includes creating a fully-functional prototype of the software tool. Throughout the technology development, feedback from users and practitioners will guide the path of the R&D for maximum usability. At the conclusion of Phase II, an end-user, in-home evaluation study will verify the effectiveness of the tool, providing the starting point for full-scale commercialization.

"Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. Detection of autism early is crucial but accurate screening tools have been elusive. In Phase II, a practical method of improving accuracy of M-CHAT, the most widely used autism screen, was created by adapting the validated and recommended follow up interview, M-CHAT F/Ui (F/U), for efficient use during the visit. In the case of a positive screen, the primary care provider (PCP) can use CHADIS, a web-based questionnaire delivery, decision support and post-visit engagement system, to conduct F/U rather than requiring a visit with another professional. Phase II data showed F/U results by a PCP were equivalent to the autism center. Phase-II data on the M-CHAT plus F/U via CHADIS replicated findings of the F/U authors in showing both excellent positive predictive value (PPV) 0.96 for children >20 months (thus effective for 24 month olds) and also low PPV 0.54 for <20 months. Promisingly, Phase II exploratory analyses using a decision tree including supplementary data from a routinely used standard language screen (ASQ communication scale) and an item from a language measure (MCDI) plus the standard autism screen (M-CHAT plus F/U) reached PPV of 0.95 in the <20 month group. This screen completion could be done efficiently online by parents. Phase IIB plans a replication of this screening procedure which promises to be accurate for 18 month olds and comparison to alternatives using the community network of >400 Maryland doctors where >22,000 autism screens have been done using the CHADIS system. A more accurate screening test is of less value if it is not universally used. In Phase II, an approach was developed that reduces disparities in access to screening using a ""talking"" tablet kiosk that was preferred by parents to alternatives, but further workflow issues will be addressed in Phase IIB. To improve screen completion, we will program an automated reminder/completion confirmation text/email system in CHADIS with coupons as incentives for parents. In Phase II, CHADIS was adapted to capture both patient input and doctor decision-making and Maintenance of Certification (MOC) accreditation was awarded by the American Board of Pediatrics for this program and earned by 140 pediatricians. This monthly doctor quality improvement program will be extended to a daily continuous quality improvement process for the whole office team to further assure patient participation in screening while providing other clinical and financial analytics of value to the office. The Phase-IIB goal is to develop and test an innovative ""screening system"" not just a new test.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism is prevalent (1 in 50 children) and impairing but early intervention has been shown to improve outcomes prompting recommendations for screening at both two year and 18 month health check-ups. In Phase I, a standard screening procedure was adapted so that doctors could efficiently identify autistic children at two years of age but the screen did not prove accurate at 18 months. Phase II data showed that a novel method combining supplemental information and a new computerized scoring pathway promised accurate detection at the critical 18 month age. This Phase 2B proposal is aimed at replicating this unique approach to early autism identification in a community sample, comparing it with alternatives plus developing innovative strategies to assure that all children are screened by automating reminders and completion confirmation and by supporting continuous quality improvement in office implementation using automated reporting analytics.            ",Improving Accuracy and Accessibility of Early Autism Screening,8714587,R44MH085399,"['Academy', 'Accreditation', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Certification', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Maintenance', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Visit', 'autistic children', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2014,796039,-0.007343997513711917
"Smart Anatomic Recognition System to Guide Emergency Intubation and Resuscitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 3 million emergency intubations are performed in the US every year and failure rates can be as high as 50% (3-5). Success is highly dependent on how frequently the responder performs this life-saving procedure on humans (6). Brio Device, LLC, an airway management medical device company, is addressing the need to decouple the success of the procedure from the experience of the user with their ""smart"" intubation device which integrates anatomic structure recognition algorithms and visual guidance feedback with an articulating stylet. Brio's intubation device is specifically designed fo the needs of emergency responders, such as paramedics, emergency department personnel, code teams in hospitals and military medics, who often arrive at the patient first. The smart intubation device will reduce failure rates by providing the user with visual instruction of the correct path to the trachea as he places the endotracheal tube. The guidance software uses machine learning and computer vision algorithms to recognize the anatomy and determine the path to insert the tube. Ultimately, the intubation device will include both a guidance display on an LCD screen and an optical stylet that has single-axis angulation control of the distal tip. For the purpose of this Phase I study, a laptop or desktop computer will be used for the image processing and the guidance display that accompanies the articulating stylet. The long-term goal is to create a device that is compact, light-weight and portable to suit the needs of ambulances and hospital crash carts.  The hypothesis for this study is that by incorporating a video guidance display with an articulating stylet, inexperienced users will be more successful in correctly placing the endotracheal tube using this device compared to direct laryngoscopy. To achieve this goal, image processing and machine learning algorithms will be developed to recognize key anatomic structures in the airway. Software will also be developed determine the path the tube should follow and to display this information for the user. Finally, the efficacy of the device will be validated in airway simulation mannequins with medical students serving as the inexperienced users. Phase II will focus on integrating the guidance software, articulating optical stylet and display into a portable device with embedded hardware and software contained within the stylet handle. At completion of Phase II, the device will be ready for clinica trials and FDA testing.  Brio will enter the $20 billion airway market with its intubation device. Initial sales will begin with anesthesiologists who are early adopters of new technology to assist with difficult airways. Brio will market its product to ~327,000 clinicians who use intubation devices. The U.S. addressable market for emergency intubation is ~$900M for the 41,000 ambulances and 5,800 emergency departments and hospital code teams.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this SBIR Phase I, Brio Device, LLC plans to create and evaluate a device that improves the success rate of emergency intubations by coupling a smart guidance display with a user-controlled single-axis articulating stylet. Emergency intubations are often performed in challenging situations by personnel who do the procedure infrequently. Since failure rates are as high as 50% and approximately 180,000 deaths occur each year from failed pre-hospital intubations, a device is needed to provide visual guidance information to assist the users and increase their success rates in emergency situations.            ",Smart Anatomic Recognition System to Guide Emergency Intubation and Resuscitation,8453607,R43HL114160,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulances', 'Anatomic structures', 'Anatomy', 'Brain Death', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Critical Care', 'Destinations', 'Devices', 'Distal', 'Emergency Situation', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Instruction', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Laryngoscopy', 'Left', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Marketing', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Students', 'Military Hospitals', 'Military Personnel', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Oxygen', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Resuscitation', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachea', 'Tube', 'Visual', 'commercial application', 'design', 'endotracheal', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information display', 'laptop', 'light weight', 'new technology', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'public health relevance', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'success']",NHLBI,"BRIO DEVICE, LLC",R43,2013,244710,0.02422226691987458
"Automating Directly Observed Therapy as a Platform Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction: Ai Cure Technologies LLC was established in 2009 to develop automated medication adherence monitoring solutions using computer vision technology. This SBIR Phase II will allow Ai Cure Technologies to test the accuracy and validity of its flagship product, AiView"". The SBIR Phase I demonstrated that the AiView"" platform was technically feasible and capable of confirming medication administration. Significance: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice. The inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounds the problem. Clinical trials depend on people taking the drug being tested. The problem of medication adherence has been addressed - determinants of adherence are being studied and new monitoring methods developed - but no solution has been able to accurately confirm real-time medication adherence while also being affordable, flexible, and likable. The Product: Ai Cure Technologies will provide an automated DOT (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam- enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. AiView"" will visually track and confirm medication administration without human supervision. Long-Term Goal: The AiView"" system will combine sophisticated computer vision technology with the best attributes of DOT for 1/400th of the cost. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects' rates of compliance and allow them to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance. Phase II hypothesis: AiView"" can be used to accurately measure and improve medication adherence across different patient populations, and positively impact self-perception and clinical outcomes. Specific Aim #1: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can accurately measure and improve medication adherence in a depression and a stroke patient population. Specific Aim #2: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can improve self-perception and improve clinical outcomes in the AiView"" intervention groups Expected Outcome: The patients in the AiView"" intervention groups (depression and stroke) are expected to have statistically significant higher adherence rates than those in the pill counting groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice with the inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounding the problem. In accordance with this SBIR Phase II grant, Ai Cure Technologies will continue development and testing of its Automated DOTSM (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam-enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration.

"Advanced training platform and methodologies for emergency responders and skilled     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a need to be able to deliver just-in-time training and reference materials for first responders and skilled support personnel. Mobile computing platforms are becoming ubiquitous and provide an ideal means to reach users at any time in any location. The process of translating existing reference materials into mobile-friendly formats is currently manual and very labor intensive. Nicolalde R&D LLC is well under way to commercialize its mTraining mobile technology and service prototyped during a phase I SBIR from NIEHS. The mTraining technology is an objective and checklist-based method for delivering just-in-time training and reference materials, making it an effective Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS) for providing workers easy access to information after training, and on site prior to or during an assignment. It provides short, incident specific awareness and safety training that can be delivered prior to responding to an emergency situation. The proposed development under this phase II SBIR includes: a) a back-end document processing engine that is able to automatically parse, analyze, mark-up, and organize documents so that their content is easily cross-referenced, linked and re-organized for effective delivery on a mobile training platform or other electronic medium. This will be connected to a server and database architecture to facilitate its operation and support storing and accessing content; b) the front-end interface for the mobile training platform (mTraining) was prototyped in Phase I of this project for delivering training content to emergency responders, skilled support personnel, and volunteers before or during an incident. The improved back-end architecture will support intelligent search capabilities for a large repository of training documents with different structures. This capability relies on the document processing engine's ability to semi-automatically extract relevant data and automatically translate this data into a structured format. This data can then be used for display in the mobile application, stored into databases, and automatically populated into ontologies.

"Developing an online educational curriculum to enhance parent-supervised driving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and injury for teens, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, 100 times as many injuries, and over 14 billion dollars in associated costs. The CDC has identified traffic crashes and associated injuries as a top public health priority. Inexperience is the leading cause of crashes among novice teen drivers, but accumulating the necessary experiences to become a safe driver can take many years. Fortunately, evidence from driving and other domains suggests that it is possible to increase experiential knowledge through scenario-based training. Current methods for providing teens with practice focus on parent-supervised driving. However, parents are ill-prepared to handle this role, with many focusing only on the mechanics of driving, laws and general safety advice. Few parents discuss decision-making aspects of driving and may even pass on inaccurate information. Many parents limit the range of driving situations teens are exposed to mistakenly believing that this increases safety rather than dangerously limiting teens' ability to accumulate important driving experience. Our long-term objective is to design and validate an innovative tool that aims to accelerate the acquisition of critical safety knowledge for teen drivers. We propose to extend our team's past work by developing scenarios appropriate for parents to use to mentor their inexperienced teen drivers. The scenarios will be part of an online educational curriculum designed to help parents provide teens with guided practice as they learn how to drive. The online tool will combine scenario- based training with innovative applications of machine learning technology to evaluate scenario responses and provide tailored feedback containing practical, developmentally appropriate strategies for improving safety as well as recommendations for parent-supervised on-the-road practice. Phase I will address these specific aims: 1) Conduct foundational research to identify realistic scenarios commonly encountered by novice teen drivers through semi-structured interviews with teen drivers aged 15-18. 2) Collect representative responses to scenarios from teens with different levels of driving experience and adults to identify the progression of knowledge and identify developmentally appropriate strategies to use as feedback. 3) Create machine learning algorithms to provide tailored feedback and recommend on-the-road driving experiences based on responses to the scenarios. 4) Develop prototype online system. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 5) Develop the Phase I proof of concept into a complete online curriculum with refined algorithms. 6) Evaluate the online curriculum for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a driving simulator experiment and limited field trial with novice teen drivers. The proposed product represents a significant shift in trainig approaches for teen drivers and through Phase III dissemination it will fill a critical need for evidence- based parent-taught driver's education.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and injury for teens, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, 100 times as many injuries, and over 14 billion dollars in associated costs; despite this, many teens' primary source of driver's education is their parents. In Phase I we propose to extend our past work for teaching experiential knowledge and develop a prototype online educational curriculum that allows parents to provide teens with guided practice by utilizing innovative machine learning technologies, while Phase II will allow us to complete the prototype and evaluate its effectiveness. The proposed application represents a significant shift in training approaches that has the potential, through Phase III dissemination, to improve teen driving safety.              Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and injury for teens, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, 100 times as many injuries, and over 14 billion dollars in associated costs; despite this, many teens' primary source of driver's education is their parents.

"Passive Activity Monitoring with Patient Identification and Gesture Detection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). Ingenium Care proposes to create a passive, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons using the novel technology of Microsoft's Kinect device. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium Care's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, people with disabilities, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. Existing monitoring technology has limited activity recognition capability or uses many sensors and wearable devices. The need for wearable devices requires cooperation from the elderly that may not reminder or resent to wear it. We propose to replace our existing wearable badge technology with a passive device based on the Kinect device from Microsoft. A network of these sensors provides precise location information within a home or facility and detects falls and gestures such as eating, drinking or taking medications. This device will eliminate the need to wear any device. Aim #1 - Goal: Develop Algorithms for Proof of Concept Gesture Recognition. Aim #2 - Goal: Do laboratory training and testing of detection algorithms utilizing a single work station. Aim #3 - Goal: Perform randomized activities and gestures in a simulated living environment and iteratively improve algorithms.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities. These are primarily elderly individuals with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and also persons with disabilities. By applying the latest monitoring and artificial intelligence technologies, the outcomes of this research would enable the Ingenium Care system to improve the quality of home and institutional health care, and at the same time, reduce the cost of providing that care.

"OTHER FUNCTIONS SBIR TOPIC 308, PHASE I: THE MOBILE FOOD INTAKE PHOTO STORAGE AN This proposal describes plans to enhance Viocare¿s Mobile Food Intake Visual and Voice Recognizer (FIVR) System. FIVR, an active Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI) project, is a novel combination of innovative technologies including computer vision and speech recognition to measure dietary intake using a mobile phone. Version 1 of FIVR uses a mobile phone¿s embedded camera to capture a short video of food to be consumed. The food to be eaten is annotated verbally on the mobile phone by the user. These video and audio files are sent to a backend server for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. This project will develop specifications to extend FIVR¿s capabilities to standardize, store, and analyze more diverse food images, such as 3D photos; to collect other food data; to enhance the analysis tools; and for interfaces to a variety of clinical/research systems. The FIVR Version 2 functional prototype will be developed to use 3D dietary images as input.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.        This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests). The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.

"NLP for Augmentative and Alternative Communication in Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal relates to the technology of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).  The research, to be developed over the three-year course of this project, relates to increasing communication speed for adult users of typing-based AAC devices. The proposed method has commonalities both with chatter bots and more sophisticated automated question answering systems. In particular, we propose to develop a program that will mine a very large database of stored interactions for sentences that are similar to the sentence currently being uttered by the interlocutor, and propose a set of plausible responses for the AAC user.

"Continuous Fall Risk Monitoring System: Walking vs Activities of Daily Living    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to U.S. emergency departments and the primary etiology of accidental deaths in persons over the age of 65 years1. Interventions such as physical therapy, adjusting medications, or behavior changes can reduce the elderly fall rate2. Fall risk determination is needed to identify who may benefit from interventions. Changes in fall risk may occur suddenly or gradually, and are more likely to become apparent in the home environment as an individual goes about their normal activities of daily living (ADLs) rather than during a limited and periodic care provider assessment. Consequently, a continuous, all-in-one system that would monitor elderly individuals in the home for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls is needed to reduce falls in the elderly. To be effective, the monitoring device must be non-intrusive and socially acceptable. The long-term goal of this project is to [extend an existing non-intrusive, commercially available monitoring system capable of location tracking, physiologic monitoring, and alerting to also assess fall risk in real time; the system would consider factors such as frequent bathroom use, fitful sleep and changes in gait characteristics]. The monitor for the proposed research has a watch form factor, is worn at the wrist, and has demonstrated high acceptance rates by elderly users. Research has shown that abnormal gait is indicative of fall risk, leading to the use of a variety of measurements of gait in fall risk determinations. To analyze gait from data gathered during ADLs, it is necessary to differentiate periods of walking, which can then be analyzed for abnormal characteristics. The purpose of this Phase I proposal is to test the [feasibility of using tri-axial acceleration data gathered from a commercially available wrist monitor to recognize periods of walking. Walking data can then be used in conjunction with other system data to] make inferences about changes in fall risk. Thirty elderly (aged 65 and over), ambulatory volunteers residing in an independent living facility will be recruited. The volunteers will be asked to engage in normal ADLs while being monitored over a 4-hour time period. During the study, volunteers will be videotaped, monitored using the wrist device, and monitored using a body-area sensor network technology developed at the University of Virginia. The specific aims of this project will be to: 1) determine if it is feasible to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using the presence of frequencies generally associated with walking in wrist- gathered acceleration data as the differentiator, 2) determine whether individuals typically demonstrate a narrower range of walking frequencies than that suggested for the entire population, and 3) determine if it is feasible to use machine learning and time-series techniques to distinguish between periods of walking and other ADLs using characteristics learned from walking and non-walking data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Falls are the leading cause of injury-related visits to emergency departments in the United States and the primary cause of accidental deaths in persons over age 651. In order to reduce the number of falls, a continuous, non-intrusive, convenient monitoring system in an acceptable form factor which will monitor elderly individuals in their home environment for signs they are becoming more susceptible to falls needs to be developed.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests). The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.           This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator.  The ultimate goal of this SBIR project is to provide the DOD, DOE, and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. In Phase I, Seacoast successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a microsensor array with a proprietary trap-and- purge preconcentrator to detect chlorinated solvents, specifically TCE, and TCA, at levels low enough to meet EPA mandated levels for drinking water. In Phase II Seacoast proposes to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of the system to better meet the needs identified by the Phase I consultant. The systems have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator traps the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. These sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical.  In Phase II Seacoast will specifically develop new materials to improve the sensor array selectivity, 1) by using impedance spectroscopy to study the mechanisms by which the polymer-based sensors sorb the target chemicals, 2) by implementing pattern recognition algorithms to identify chemicals for the sensor responses, and 3) by designing new preconcentrator materials that can bind these chemicals more strongly.  The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. Potential markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.           This proposal describes a novel technology that specifically addresses the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations.

"Automated Salivary Gland Dissection for Manufacture of Malaria PfSPZ Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sanaria was founded in 2003 to develop and commercialize an attenuated sporozoite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) (PfSPZ) vaccine against malaria. Since then Sanaria has established a manufacturing process, manufactured the PfSPZ Vaccine under cGMPs, submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) to the FDA, received clearance from the FDA to proceed to clinical trials, and initiated the first Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of SANARIA PfSPZ Vaccine in May 2009. The PfSPZ vaccine is comprised of Pf sporozoites extracted from infected mosquitoes and a short term challenge for Sanaria involves the optimization of this extraction step in its manufacturing process. Currently, human operators manually carry out the critical task of isolating the sporozoites by serially dissecting salivary glands from individual mosquitoes. Sanaria has established this procedure as a reliable, reproducible, consistent, and efficient process. In the next phase of development, as we optimize the efficiency and expand the scale of vaccine manufacturing, automation of mosquito dissection will prove to be beneficial on several fronts. It will enable us to cut the costs of supporting a large taskforce of skilled technicians, the time taken to train and qualify them and the dedicated space necessary for a scaled-up manual operation. Therefore in this SBIR proposal, we focus on successfully developing strategies to mechanize the process of dissection and collection of mosquito salivary glands. In collaboration with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University we propose to develop novel instrumentation and innovative technologies to meet this goal. These will be addressed in three specific aims in which we will develop procedures that will allow batch processing of mosquitoes to isolate intact salivary glands with minimal manual involvement. This will be achieved using mechanical engineering and physical chemistry principles. First, in specific aim 1 we will create ordered arrays of mosquitoes and in specific aim 2 we will develop methods to decapitate mosquitoes and to extract and collect the salivary glands without losing sporozoites. The technology described here is expected to achieve very high throughput and process scalability. In specific aim 3 we propose a direct substitution of our current dissection configuration with robotic arms and vision guided microscope systems. This serial processing approach will circumvent the need to create mosquito assemblies and involves limited, if any, manual operation. The end-product from the advanced automated techniques however must match or exceed Sanaria's current standards for vaccine yield and potency and will drive the decision to translate our current method of mosquito salivary gland dissection to an automated platform.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a >90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for >$1 billion annual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world. Success in this Phase I SBIR will lead to a significant increase in the efficiency of manufacture of the PfSPZ Vaccine that will facilitate scale-up of manufacturing and significantly reduce the cost of goods.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel.

"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software for Mathematics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Fast-Track application focuses on developing the first artificial intelligence (AI) educational software to teach developmental mathematics to the blind and visually impaired. This project responds to the National Eye Institute's General Research Topics for ""teaching tools"" and the Visual Impairment and Blindness Program for ""other devices that meet the rehabilitative and everyday living needs of persons who are blind or have low vision."" The intervention being developed will place a comprehensive set of AI mathematics tutoring systems with integrated AI assessment capabilities in the hands of the blind K-12, college and adult student, for use on demand during study at home and at school. The formulation of an advanced AI tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to its design will have broad implications for development in many subject areas beyond mathematics. Project objectives include: Horizontal Expansion of Accessible Curriculum Content Coverage (Ratio and Proportion, Percentages, Linear Equations, Metric Units, Scientific Notation) 1) Conduct initial accessibility review and analysis of AI tutor's existing user interface. 2) Implement accessibility requirements and recommendations from NFB, instructors and other partners. 3) Conduct final review to gain NFB accessibility certification after implementation of requirements. 4) Develop and issue survey of instructors on mathematics pedagogy and technology. Vertical Expansion of Accessible Features and Technological Capability 5) Implement Braille support in AI technology. 6) Develop additional AI tutor on Fractions that is automatically accessible from first principles using accessible AI framework. Evaluation of Accessible AI Educational Technology 7) Field evaluation of accessible AI technology with blind students and their instructors. 8) Continued demonstration and review of accessible AI technology by partners and other stakeholders. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum already has long-term partnerships established with McGraw- Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as a major science education catalog company, CyberEd, Inc., a PLATO Learning Company.

"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.          n/a",Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones,7895863,U01HL091737,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asia', 'Car Phone', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical activity scale', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shoes', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Sports', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cost', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'open source', 'prototype', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'social', 'software development', 'software systems']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2010,534121,0.02339856561637424
"Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Falls among the elderly, one of the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions, are a major health problem. Several studies have identified quantifiable gait markers that appear to distinguish between elderly ""fallers"" and non-fallers. These studies have relied on data acquired in gait-laboratories. Extending gait assessment capability, and falls detection, into the home could provide valuable before-the-fact information on gait weakness evolution, which in turn could be used to assess the efficiency of counter measures. Current mobile gait analysis techniques are insufficient because they rely on compliance or are too intrusive. The development of a new gait assessment and falls monitor is proposed. The device is passive and obtains gait data from sensing floor vibrations as well as a minimally invasive wireless device, precluding the need to walk on special surfaces or be observed by cameras. This study's principal aim is to validate the device's performance through a comparison with accepted gait assessment techniques at the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Gait lab at the University of Virginia Health System   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents. Fall-related injuries are among the most common reasons requiring medical intervention and are a contributing factor in 40% of nursing home admissions. The cost of falls to the national economy is significant. In 1994 the total cost due to falls was estimated to be $20.2 billion. This number is expected to climb to $32.2 billion by 2020. One suggestion for reducing the number of falls has been the creation of a fall risk assessment for institutional residents, an important component of which is gait assessment. In view of the results obtained during the Phase I effort, it appears that the floor sensor system may be able to answer a well defined need for which there is presently no other solution that promises to be as readily implementable and for which the market potential is significant.           Non-obtrusive Gait & Fall Monitoring Notice Number: NOT-OD-10-034) Notice Title: NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications for Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Transfer Technology Research Grants (R43/R44 and R41/R42) through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) An estimated 20% - 40% of community-dwelling elderly fall at least once a year 2 and this rate increases for nursing home residents.

"Automated Salivary Gland Dissection for Manufacture of Malaria PfSPZ Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sanaria was founded in 2003 to develop and commercialize an attenuated sporozoite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) (PfSPZ) vaccine against malaria. Since then Sanaria has established a manufacturing process, manufactured the PfSPZ Vaccine under cGMPs, submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) to the FDA, received clearance from the FDA to proceed to clinical trials, and initiated the first Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of SANARIA PfSPZ Vaccine in May 2009. The PfSPZ vaccine is comprised of Pf sporozoites extracted from infected mosquitoes and a short term challenge for Sanaria involves the optimization of this extraction step in its manufacturing process. Currently, human operators manually carry out the critical task of isolating the sporozoites by serially dissecting salivary glands from individual mosquitoes. Sanaria has established this procedure as a reliable, reproducible, consistent, and efficient process. In the next phase of development, as we optimize the efficiency and expand the scale of vaccine manufacturing, automation of mosquito dissection will prove to be beneficial on several fronts. It will enable us to cut the costs of supporting a large taskforce of skilled technicians, the time taken to train and qualify them and the dedicated space necessary for a scaled-up manual operation. Therefore in this SBIR proposal, we focus on successfully developing strategies to mechanize the process of dissection and collection of mosquito salivary glands. In collaboration with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University we propose to develop novel instrumentation and innovative technologies to meet this goal. These will be addressed in three specific aims in which we will develop procedures that will allow batch processing of mosquitoes to isolate intact salivary glands with minimal manual involvement. This will be achieved using mechanical engineering and physical chemistry principles. First, in specific aim 1 we will create ordered arrays of mosquitoes and in specific aim 2 we will develop methods to decapitate mosquitoes and to extract and collect the salivary glands without losing sporozoites. The technology described here is expected to achieve very high throughput and process scalability. In specific aim 3 we propose a direct substitution of our current dissection configuration with robotic arms and vision guided microscope systems. This serial processing approach will circumvent the need to create mosquito assemblies and involves limited, if any, manual operation. The end-product from the advanced automated techniques however must match or exceed Sanaria's current standards for vaccine yield and potency and will drive the decision to translate our current method of mosquito salivary gland dissection to an automated platform.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a >90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for >$1 billion annual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world. Success in this Phase I SBIR will lead to a significant increase in the efficiency of manufacture of the PfSPZ Vaccine that will facilitate scale-up of manufacturing and significantly reduce the cost of goods.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel.

"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software for Mathematics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Fast-Track application focuses on developing the first artificial intelligence (AI) educational software to teach developmental mathematics to the blind and visually impaired. This project responds to the National Eye Institute's General Research Topics for ""teaching tools"" and the Visual Impairment and Blindness Program for ""other devices that meet the rehabilitative and everyday living needs of persons who are blind or have low vision."" The intervention being developed will place a comprehensive set of AI mathematics tutoring systems with integrated AI assessment capabilities in the hands of the blind K-12, college and adult student, for use on demand during study at home and at school. The formulation of an advanced AI tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to its design will have broad implications for development in many subject areas beyond mathematics. Project objectives include: Horizontal Expansion of Accessible Curriculum Content Coverage (Ratio and Proportion, Percentages, Linear Equations, Metric Units, Scientific Notation) 1) Conduct initial accessibility review and analysis of AI tutor's existing user interface. 2) Implement accessibility requirements and recommendations from NFB, instructors and other partners. 3) Conduct final review to gain NFB accessibility certification after implementation of requirements. 4) Develop and issue survey of instructors on mathematics pedagogy and technology. Vertical Expansion of Accessible Features and Technological Capability 5) Implement Braille support in AI technology. 6) Develop additional AI tutor on Fractions that is automatically accessible from first principles using accessible AI framework. Evaluation of Accessible AI Educational Technology 7) Field evaluation of accessible AI technology with blind students and their instructors. 8) Continued demonstration and review of accessible AI technology by partners and other stakeholders. Preparation for success in Phase III has already been undertaken by involving partners that are important commercially as well as technically, such as the National Federation of the Blind and the American Printing House for the Blind (APH). In addition, Quantum already has long-term partnerships established with McGraw- Hill and Holt, Rinehart and Winston, two of the country's leading educational publishers, as well as a major science education catalog company, CyberEd, Inc., a PLATO Learning Company.

"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users.

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator. Seacoast's Phase I research will focus on developing the sensor array, demonstrating sensitivity to chlorinated hydrocarbons at relevant concentrations, and field tests in actual contaminated sites. The ultimate goal is to provide the DOD, DOE, NIEHS and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. The systems will have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator collects the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. The sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical. An array of differently responding sensors and pattern recognition can thereby compensate for changes in humidity, temperature, and composition. These low-power systems can be left unattended and transmit data wirelessly or through USB to a central location. The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. The potential commercial markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will describe a potential method to specifically address the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.          n/a",Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants,7847964,R43ES016941,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorinated Hydrocarbons', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Humidity', 'Industrial Health', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nose', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Soil', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trichloroethylene', 'Water', 'Work', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cold temperature', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'innovation', 'membrane assembly', 'pollutant', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'superfund site', 'vapor', 'wasting', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,"SEACOAST SCIENCE, INC.",R43,2009,11376,0.02809003338055283

"Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several US agencies and regulators require low-cost chemical sensors for detecting and monitoring environmental clean-up, remediation, and decommissioning processes where groundwater may be contaminated. The sensors must be capable of detecting contaminants in the sub-surface groundwater and must be compatible with use in a range of environments. Most significantly, these customers require a low-cost alternative to its current expensive and labor intensive methods, namely using mobile laboratories. The project will result in the innovative use of low-cost sensor systems that will be capable of detecting and monitoring for dense non-aqueous phase liquids in the subsurface and groundwater, unattended, and in real- time from within a push-probe, using a chemicapacitor array and miniature preconcentrator. Seacoast's Phase I research will focus on developing the sensor array, demonstrating sensitivity to chlorinated hydrocarbons at relevant concentrations, and field tests in actual contaminated sites. The ultimate goal is to provide the DOD, DOE, NIEHS and other agencies with a method to map and track subsurface contamination plumes in real-time without requiring an operator. The systems will have MEMS microcapacitor sensor arrays that can monitor for leaks of toxic chemicals, contaminants from wastes, and changes in groundwater streams. A preconcentrator collects the contaminants and releases them to a microsensor array. The sensor arrays are filled with several chemoselective polymers whose dielectric permittivity changes when exposed to different vapors, creating a fingerprint response for each chemical. An array of differently responding sensors and pattern recognition can thereby compensate for changes in humidity, temperature, and composition. These low-power systems can be left unattended and transmit data wirelessly or through USB to a central location. The most important application to public health and safety is unattended monitoring of drinking water, water treatment processes, and water sources. The potential commercial markets include building chemical process monitoring and control, toxic vapor leak detection, industrial process control, and industrial health and safety. Transitioning the developed prototype to other markets where worker and public health, environmental health and regulatory compliance will be investigated to reduce the financial risks and broaden the acceptance of the technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will describe a potential method to specifically address the need for detecting groundwater contaminants and long-term monitoring of contaminated sites, by providing an unattended sensor system that tracks contamination in real-time and transmits contaminant concentrations. Such a system would be used in tandem with other methods, to provide comprehensive contamination management at DOE, DOD, and Superfund sites where ground and water clean-up projects are already underway. The proposed work will focus on detection of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are described as among the most common pollutants in groundwater and soils at DOE sites.          n/a",Low-Cost Electronic Nose for Groundwater Contaminants,7537117,R43ES016941,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorinated Hydrocarbons', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Compatible', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Humidity', 'Industrial Health', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Numbers', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'ROC Curve', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Soil', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trichloroethylene', 'Water', 'Work', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cold temperature', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'drinking water', 'ground water', 'innovation', 'membrane assembly', 'pollutant', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'response', 'sensor', 'superfund site', 'vapor', 'wasting', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,"SEACOAST SCIENCE, INC.",R43,2008,97690,0.02809003338055283
"Webcam Interface for Audio/touch Graphics Access by Blind People    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to develop a compact inexpensive alternative to the bulky expensive touchpads now required by blind people for audio/touch access to graphical information. Audio/touch is known to provide excellent access to computer-literate blind people as well as people with dyslexia or other severe print disabilities. Preparing Audio/touch materials was very expensive until ViewPlus introduced the IVEO Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) Authoring/conversion software in 2005. IVEO permits virtually any graphical information to be created or converted/imported easily to a well- structured highly accessible SVG format. Tactile copy was also very expensive before 2000 when ViewPlus introduced the Tiger embossing Windows printers that ""print"" by embossing. The new ViewPlus Emprint printer/embossers emboss and also print color images, creating color tactile images particularly useful for people with dyslexia and a number of other print disabilities. An audio/touch user reads an IVEO SVG graphic using the free IVEO Viewer, a tactile copy of the image, and a touchpad. The user places the tactile graphic on the touchpad and presses a point of interest. The touchpad communicates the position of that point back to the computer, and the IVEO Viewer speaks the appropriate information. Tactile text made from mainstream graphics has a distinctive pattern. When a user presses, that text is spoken by the IVEO Viewer. When the user presses a graphic object having a SVG title within the file, that title will be spoken. Objects may also have arbitrarily long description fields that can be spoken and browsed. All spoken information can be displayed on an attached braille display if desired. Graphical information is ubiquitous today, but almost none is accessible to blind people. Government agencies, libraries, companies, and agencies serving people with disabilities could easily send highly accessible IVEO graphics files and tactile graphic copies to clients with disabilities, but there is a ""chicken and egg"" dilemma that must be overcome before they are likely to do so. Few blind people have a touchpad (which cost $500 or more), so few could use that information. The specific aim of this Phase I proposal is to develop an affordable webcam-based prototype as an alternative to touchpads. It is based on an inexpensive webcam that is focused on the graphic and follows a finger. A touchpad press is emulated in this prototype by pressing some computer key with the other hand. This project could be the key to bringing accessible graphics to all blind computer users and is clearly of interest to NEI whose mission statement includes mental health and quality of life of blind people. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal is relevant to the mission of the National Eye Institute, because it could be the key to making nearly all graphical information easily accessible to people who are blind or have other severe print disabilities. Graphical information is ubiquitous in the world today but is not presently accessible to blind people except through expensive and time-consuming conversion by trained transcribers. Making all graphical information accessible would have an obviously highly beneficial direct effect on education and professional opportunities, mental health, and quality of life of blind people. Mental health and quality of life issues for blind people are parts of the mission of the National Eye Institute.          n/a",Webcam Interface for Audio/touch Graphics Access by Blind People,7480812,R43EY018973,"['Back', 'Braille Display', 'Businesses', 'Chickens', 'Client', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Dyslexia', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Eye Institute', 'Numbers', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Printing', 'Professional Education', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure of nail of finger', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tigers', 'Time', 'Title', 'Today', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'desire', 'digital', 'disability', 'egg', 'interest', 'literate', 'print disabilities', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'touchpad', 'vector']",NEI,"VIEWPLUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2008,100001,-0.044565385298936264
"Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding For The Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced Medical Electronics (AME) proposes the development of an indoor way-finding device utilizing the unique magnetic anomaly patterns that exist in modern, man-made structures. The proposed system will record the magnitude of magnetic field strength from sensors in three orthogonal axes. The time history of these magnetic data points can be continuously compared with an electronic map of magnetic anomalies (or, ""signature"") to determine current position within a building. The phase I developed prototype system tracked in feasibility experiments with an accuracy of 1 foot (radius). Magnetic anomalies render a magnetic compass useless for finding a directional bearing. However, these same invisible anomalies represent valuable, unique indoor terrain features measurable by magnetic sensors located inside a small, portable device. Such a device would be able to provide low-vision users with a valuable indoor low-cost way-finding tool analogous to a Global Positioning System (GPS) device used outdoors. About 3.7 million Americans are visually disabled. Of these, 200,000 are blind, and the rest have low vision. The key advantage of the way-finding concept presented in this proposal, over other methods, is that the benefits are made available to the visually impaired community without requiring expensive building infrastructure investments. This is of particular advantage to large government buildings and educational campuses. The proposed approach allows a cost effective solution to way-finding within these buildings.          n/a",Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding For The Visually Impaired,7477498,R44EY015616,"['American', 'Appointment', 'Building Codes', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Funding', 'Government', 'Hand', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Location', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Electronics', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurosciences', 'Numbers', 'Oceans', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rest', 'Services', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Solutions', 'Somatotype', 'Speech', 'Steel', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'blind', 'college', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'court', 'design', 'digital', 'foot', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'miniaturize', 'motor control', 'performance tests', 'professor', 'prototype', 'radius bone structure', 'research study', 'sensor', 'sensory integration', 'tool', 'way finding']",NEI,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2008,365248,-0.022548663031049517
"Machine Learning Applied to Automated Planar Patch Clamps    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The introduction of automated planar patch clamp instruments over the past two years has increased the throughput of voltage clamp ion channel assays by a factor of at least ten. This is possible because the automated systems can perform assays in parallel using16 and 384-well plates. While the drug discovery industry has embraced this new technology, the enthusiasm has been tempered by the modest success rates of the assays and by the high cost of the consumable patch substrate. Currently, typical success rates for a standard ion channel assay, using, for example, the Q-Patch from Sophion Biosciences, the Port-a-Patch system from Nanion Biosciences, or the PatchXpress from Molecular Devices Corp., is around 50%. In other words, for every16 channel chip used in these systems, only eight will produce useable data. This effectively doubles the price of each data point over what is ideally possible. In order for a planar patch clamp experiment to succeed, several events need to occur (assuming that the cell expresses the appropriate ion channels in functional states): the cell of interest must form a high-resistance seal with the planar substrate, the whole-cell configuration must be achieved, and fluidic pathways must be intact so that compounds of interest maybe applied to the cell. A failure of anyone of these steps will result in no data collected from that well. We propose to optimize the first two steps in this process, namely, seal formation and entry into whole-cell recording configuration. We will use machine learning approaches to examine how a human patch clamp expert interacts with the patch clamp system in order to develop a model that will provide parameters that can be used to more efficiently and successfully provide useable whole-cell recording configuration. It is important to note that the model that we derive from our approach will not actually copy what the expert does, but will attempt to optimize the process based on cues that mayor may not be consciously monitored by the expert. The Specific Aims of the Phase I component will be to: (1) integrate recording capabilities into existing automated patch clamp software from Nanion, (2) evaluate the success rate of the procedure specified by our machine learning analysis, and (3) develop stand-alone software for use specifically with manual patch clamp setups and for exploration of the potential benefits of using machine learning via expert training in other applications. In Phase II we propose to develop the proof-of-concept software into a user-friendly commercial software module which we will offer to existing and potential automated patch clamp companies. We will also simplify and streamline the user interface of this software as a stand-alone component for manual patch clamp systems. Developing drugs that target ion channels has been hindered by the expense of the consumables used in automated patch clamp screening devices. We propose to develop a method, using machine learning techniques which may increase the success rate of these instruments and therefore lower the overall cost of ion channel drug discovery.          n/a",Machine Learning Applied to Automated Planar Patch Clamps,7220448,R43EB007148,"['Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Employee Strikes', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Ion Channel', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Running', 'Sales', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cell type', 'concept', 'cost', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'new technology', 'patch clamp', 'programs', 'research study', 'seal', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'voltage', 'voltage clamp']",NIBIB,BLATZ SCIENTIFIC,R43,2007,199389,-0.02004478652758745
"Computer Vision Methods for the Real Time Assessment of Dietary Intake    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Self- monitoring of all foods and beverages consumed is central to weight loss and maintenance efforts; however, this places a heavy burden on the user. These same burdens also impede nutritional research. The proposed research is for the testing of a semi-automated, objective, near real-time computer vision and pattern recognition approach to the measurement of dietary intake. In the proposed product, cell phone pictures of meals and snacks will be analyzed by software in an attempt to automatically recognize as many items as possible. A small number of intelligent yes/no questions will help provide additional information when necessary in order to meet the accuracy demands of the target application. Following identification of the items, the software will estimate the portion sizes of all identified items. The experiments comprising this Phase I SBIR are (a) extract the most informative sets of features using a large number of food and beverage items taken from an existing database of real world meal images, (b) compare the accuracy of candidate pattern recognition approaches to identify items based on the extracted features, (c) identify the most feasible algorithms for estimating portion size, and (d) test usability and user acceptance with a simulated version of the product. Phase II will (a) apply the approach to a greater variety of food and beverage items, (b) improve automated analysis, and (c) compare the approach to existing assessment instruments.

"Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging of the U.S. population presents many challenges. The existing paradigm of care will not allocate resources efficiently as the size of the population requiring home care assistance grows. Our objective is to enhance elder independence by providing both better and more timely predictive health-status assessments and direct, real-time, recommendations and warnings. These together will lower the risk of elders remaining at home or in low intensity care settings. The objective of the Phase II research and development effort is to develop technology that can detect and track activities in the home environment and to demonstrate its usefulness in allowing elders to remain in their homes longer than is now possible. CleverSet will develop and deploy a prototype CleverSet Activity Tracker, CAT, that processes data from a robust set of simple sensors to (1) track the activities of daily living over time (2) modify these tracked activities to include uncertainty about the environment and risk to produce notifications of Events Requiring Intervention (ERIs); and (3) demonstrate the results of the models. The technological innovation of the proposed work is the application of dynamic relational Bayesian networks (DRBNs) to activities in the home environment. CleverSet's DRBN algorithms collectively referred to as CleverSet Modeler, exploit the data model and meta-data from the schema to guide and frame relational queries about behavior and events. In the proposed work, DRBNs will be used to represent complex, dynamic, multi-scale processes involving multiple actors, as probability distributions over the elements, queries, and relationships in the DRBN model. Activities of daily living (ADLs) will be identified using DRBN machine learning algorithms from sensor data and tracked through time. Short-term rhythms of daily life as well as longer-term transitions will be tracked. Risk modifiers relevant to elders will be integrated into the model and used to adapt the sensor data input. Sensor studies will also be performed to determine the relative contribution of sensors to the DRBN ADL models. A software prototype integrating the elements of the Phase II effort will be developed.         n/a",Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place,7287365,R44AG024687,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Copyright', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Drops', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Outsourcing', 'Phase', 'Placement', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Privacy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'network models', 'patient home care', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'technological innovation', 'tool']",NIA,"CLEVERSET, INC.",R44,2007,378793,-0.006478574757316016
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,7286095,K22LM008794,"['Algorithms', 'Altretamine', 'Antibodies', 'Antigenic Specificity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Buffers', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dissociation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Haptens', 'Hemolysin', 'Immunology', 'Informatics', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Toxin', 'Variant', 'antibody engineering', 'antigen antibody binding', 'antigen binding', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experimental analysis', 'markov model', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanopore', 'programs', 'protein structure function', 'prototype', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'tool', 'vector', 'web interface']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2007,162000,-0.011484134100369194
"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration .By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wirelessaccelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at thehip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometerswill be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permiting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months.

"Automatic Detection of Critical Dermoscopy Features for Melanoma Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant melanoma, with an estimated growth in incidence of about 6% per year for decades, causes considerable loss of life. Yet melanoma can be easily cured if detected early. Digital dermoscopy has shown promise for more accurate detection, particularly at an early stage. Recent conferences have highlighted a general agreement on definition of dermoscopic features and moderate agreement on the most useful structural features. Automatic detection of these specific structures that are critical for early diagnosis and are used in various dermoscopic diagnostic algorithms would be desirable. Yet little work has been published on automatic detection of any specific dermoscopic structures. Although specific colors figure prominently in the definition of the most critical dermoscopic structures, little work has been done on finding the specific regions or region combinations in the color space where colors are located, particularly with reference to the surrounding skin. The work in Phase I and after Phase I successfully segmented the border within 5% of the range of the dermatologists' borders, found several highly accurate dermoscopy features, and brought mean diagnostic accuracy on difficult early lesions to a high level. This proposal seeks to develop a digital dermosocopy system by 1) comparing classifiers 2) testing border accuracy and modifying segmentation if needed 3) developing an algorithm that uses a three-dimensional representation of a probability density function to specify single and paired melanoma colors via cluster methods and fuzzy logic techniques 4) identifying critical structural features including brown globules, abrupt border cutoff, granularity, regression, and pigment asymmetry with high accuracy 5) developing a clinical interface for acquisition of images within the clinic 6) testing the new algorithms in six dermatology clinics including two pigmented lesion clinics with both EpiLight and DermLite II Pro dermoscopy images taken in the clinic. Key features of the research include dermatopathology confirmation of specific structures and the use of relative color analysis. If successful, software will be marketed to the growing number of dermatologists with digital dermoscopy capability. The commercial software package will be ready for marketing as a diagnostic adjunct for digital camera dermoscopy attachments. Malignant melanoma, with an estimated growth in incidence of about 6% per year for decades, causes considerable loss of life. Melanoma can be easily cured if detected early, and this project seeks to develop a digital dermoscopy device that can detect very early melanomas. The project goal is to develop inexpensive melanoma detection software and test it in multiple dermatology clinics.          n/a",Automatic Detection of Critical Dermoscopy Features for Melanoma Diagnosis,7284886,R44CA101639,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Am 80', 'Amelanotic Melanoma', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Borderline Lesion', 'Boxing', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Cicatrix', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Count', 'Decision Trees', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease regression', 'Dysplastic Nevus', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Hair', 'Hair Removal', 'Head', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Lentigo', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'N(delta)-acetylornithine, -isomer', 'N-dodecanoylglutamic acid, -isomer, sodium salt', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Pigments', 'Precancerous melanosis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'ROC Curve', 'Radial', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Score', 'Series', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Work', 'alpha-difluoromethyl-DOPA, -isomer', 'alpha-methylornithine dihydrochloride, -isomer', 'base', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'melanoma', 'reconstruction', 'software development', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool development', 'vector']",NCI,STOECKER & ASSOCIATES,R44,2007,494442,-0.032452835161320026
"A Laser-Based Device for Work Site Stability Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Summary: A laser-based acoustic emission (AE) detection device is proposed for work site structural stability assessment. This new device will take advantage of innovations in laser ultrasonics, artificial intelligence (Al) and advanced acoustic emission technology to provide mine workers with a unique instant, real time stability assessment of immediate rock structures in the working environment, which was not attainable in the past. Nonlinear optical interferometry based on two-wave mixing / photo-induced electromotive force techniques will be used for AE signal detection from rock structures in mine sites. Al criteria will be established by wave pattern recognition to identify unstable areas in mine sites. This research will also result in a unique non-contact monitoring device for acoustic emission/microseismic studies, which will be very useful in many areas of application. The primary objective of the Phase II research is to develop the prototype of the AE detector and test it in real-world mining facilities. The primary objective consists of six specific aims: 1. instrumentation development, 2. pre-field experiment preparation, 3. in-situ data collection, 4. Al criteria development, 5. system integration and in-situ trial, and 6. documentation and reporting. Relevance to Public Health: The innovation will contribute to a reduction the occupational injuries and fatalities caused by roof falls, sidewall crumples, stope collapses, and slope slides, etc., in the mining industry.

"Smart Wheelchair Component System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Independent mobility is critical to individuals of any age. While the needs of many individuals with disabilities can be satisfied with power wheelchairs, some members of the disabled community find it difficult or impossible to operate a standard power wheelchair. This population includes, but is not limited to, individuals with low vision, visual field neglect, spasticity, tremors, or cognitive deficits. The goal of this project is to develop a set of components that can be added to standard power wheelchairs to convert them into ""smart"" wheelchairs which can assist the user in navigation and obstacle avoidance. During Phase I, a prototype of the Smart Wheelchair Component System (SWCS) was developed from a laptop computer and a collection of sonar, infrared and bump sensors. The evaluation activities performed during Phase I demonstrated that the system is compatible with multiple brands of wheelchairs, can accept both continuous and switch-based input, and can support front-, mid-, and rear-wheel drive wheelchairs. During Phase II, we propose to refine the system hardware and software; replace the laptop computer with an embedded microprocessor; fabricate enclosures for the system components; and develop tools to support clinicians in installing and configuring the system. The system will be evaluated in tests involving potential users, clinicians, and wheelchair design standards. The final product will be a market-ready modular system which can be attached to a variety of standard power wheelchairs. This product has the potential to increase the independence and quality of life of many wheelchair users and potential wheelchair users whose disabilities limit their capacity for independent wheelchair navigation.       n/a",Smart Wheelchair Component System,7237214,R44HD040023,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Child', 'Client', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Compatible', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disadvantaged', 'Documentation', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Joystick', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microprocessor', 'Numbers', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Self Perception', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Travel', 'Tremor', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'base', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'laptop', 'member', 'neglect', 'peer', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'sonar', 'tool']",NICHD,AT SCIENCES,R44,2007,387828,-0.020376973461200206
"Indoor Magnetic Wayfinding For The Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced Medical Electronics (AME) proposes the development of an indoor way-finding device utilizing the unique magnetic anomaly patterns that exist in modern, man-made structures. The proposed system will record the magnitude of magnetic field strength from sensors in three orthogonal axes. The time history of these magnetic data points can be continuously compared with an electronic map of magnetic anomalies (or, ""signature"") to determine current position within a building. The phase I developed prototype system tracked in feasibility experiments with an accuracy of 1 foot (radius). Magnetic anomalies render a magnetic compass useless for finding a directional bearing. However, these same invisible anomalies represent valuable, unique indoor terrain features measurable by magnetic sensors located inside a small, portable device. Such a device would be able to provide low-vision users with a valuable indoor low-cost way-finding tool analogous to a Global Positioning System (GPS) device used outdoors. About 3.7 million Americans are visually disabled. Of these, 200,000 are blind, and the rest have low vision. The key advantage of the way-finding concept presented in this proposal, over other methods, is that the benefits are made available to the visually impaired community without requiring expensive building infrastructure investments. This is of particular advantage to large government buildings and educational campuses.

"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects.

"Home Sensor Date Fusion to Support Aging in Place    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging of the U.S. population presents many challenges. The existing paradigm of care will not allocate resources efficiently as the size of the population requiring home care assistance grows. Our objective is to enhance elder independence by providing both better and more timely predictive health-status assessments and direct, real-time, recommendations and warnings. These together will lower the risk of elders remaining at home or in low intensity care settings. The objective of the Phase II research and development effort is to develop technology that can detect and track activities in the home environment and to demonstrate its usefulness in allowing elders to remain in their homes longer than is now possible. CleverSet will develop and deploy a prototype CleverSet Activity Tracker, CAT, that processes data from a robust set of simple sensors to (1) track the activities of daily living over time (2) modify these tracked activities to include uncertainty about the environment and risk to produce notifications of Events Requiring Intervention (ERIs); and (3) demonstrate the results of the models. The technological innovation of the proposed work is the application of dynamic relational Bayesian networks (DRBNs) to activities in the home environment. CleverSet's DRBN algorithms collectively referred to as CleverSet Modeler, exploit the data model and meta-data from the schema to guide and frame relational queries about behavior and events. In the proposed work, DRBNs will be used to represent complex, dynamic, multi-scale processes involving multiple actors, as probability distributions over the elements, queries, and relationships in the DRBN model. Activities of daily living (ADLs) will be identified using DRBN machine learning algorithms from sensor data and tracked through time. Short-term rhythms of daily life as well as longer-term transitions will be tracked. Risk modifiers relevant to elders will be integrated into the model and used to adapt the sensor data input. Sensor studies will also be performed to determine the relative contribution of sensors to the DRBN ADL models.

"Intelligent Tutor for WMD EMS Incident Management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop EMS/IM ITS, a suite of simulation-based intelligent tutoring systems and scenarios that will enable practice-based learning of WMD emergency medical services incident management principles and skills, including situation assessment, decision-making, and real-time execution of EMS tasks within an incident command structure. To support practical and economical development of many EMS/IM ITS training scenarios, we will also develop software tools and development methods that enable efficient authoring of new scenarios and adaptation/enhancement of existing scenarios by instructors or subject matter experts, without programming. We will leverage our tutoring system development tools and our experience developing tutoring systems for medical training, command and control, and tactical decision-making. The National Incident Management System (NIMS) was mandated by HSPD-5 to provide a comprehensive, national approach to domestic incident management, so that all levels of government across the nation could work efficiently and effectively together to prepare for, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents.

"Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Individuals with epilepsy, their families and the professionals that treat them have long felt the need for reliable warning of an impending epileptic seizure. In Phase I, we developed a unique, multi-parameter, individualized, trainable seizure predetection system which extracts spectral, wavelet and time domain features and uses recurrent neural networks to analyze many hours of multichannel EEG and predetect seizure onsets with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The underlying analytical software for this system was tested on large database of scalp EEG recordings from five epilepsy centers and contained over 373 hours of recordings from 17 patients containing 50 seizures. This is a large database compared to those reported by most investigators in this field. Phase I results were very accurate and reliable (sensitivity: 100%, false positive rate 0.02/hr and detection times that occurred an average of 9.1 seconds, before seizure onset). This is entirely acceptable for our primary target application, of warning of a seizure onset to enable timely diagnostic injection to locate the brain region where the seizure starts using SPECT imaging. In Phase II we will refine the detection process, validate performance in a large data set, implement the software in C++ modules, and test the commercial prototype in a clinical setting. These steps will result in a company supported Phase III product development, integration into existing EEG recording systems, beta testing and commercialization. While Phase 2 will concentrate on the SPECT application using scalp electrodes, the scalp EEG techniques developed will be applicable without change for general use in an epilepsy monitoring facility to alert staff of impending seizures and allow them to attend to patient safety in a timely manner. Predetection will also facilitate neuropsychological or other testing in the epilepsy monitoring environment. With additional work, the techniques developed can be applied to ambulatory devices for seizure alert, or for episodic vagal nerve stimulation to block seizures. n/a",Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures,7109311,R44NS039214,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain disorder diagnosis', 'brain electrical activity', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'early diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'neuropsychology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient monitoring device', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,"CHATTEN ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2006,400929,0.04212501253209427
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,7119996,K22LM008794,"['antigen antibody reaction', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanotechnology', 'pore forming protein', 'protein quantitation /detection']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2006,162000,-0.011484134100369194
"Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantum has successfully developed, tested and brought to the classroom the first artificial intelligence (Al) tutoring systems in chemistry education. This work successfully addressed several longstanding, clearly articulated needs for improved interactive educational software. A leading distributor for the U.S. and Canada, Science Kit & Boreal Laboratories, as well as prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, have entered into long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. The aim of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to bring the full power and benefits of this cutting-edge new educational technology to students who are blind and visually impaired. There is a considerable need for improved educational software for science education in general, but the problem of quality educational software materials for the blind is known to be particularly acute. Certain unique attributes of the Quantum Al Tutors make them potentially very well suited for full accessibility to the blind using Internet-capable screen reader technology. The potential technological innovation here is the development of advanced Al tutoring technology that has accessibility built into its framework design. If successful, an immediate outcome will be the first Al tutoring systems that are accessible to blind students, delivered through the Internet. A formulation of an Al tutoring methodology with accessibility inherent to the design will have broad implications for the prospect of developing sophisticated accessible educational software in all content areas, beyond chemistry. This project can only be accomplished by working intimately with experts in education for the blind, and Quantum has arranged a number of important partnerships in this respect, for research as well as commercialization of the resulting technology, including: the National Federation of the Blind, the American Printing House for the Blind, Pearson Learning Group, Bartimaeus Group and Henter Mathematics. n/a",Accessible Artificial Intelligence Tutoring Software,6880607,R43EY016251,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'blind aid', 'chemistry', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'educational resource design /development', 'science education', 'technology /technique development']",NEI,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2005,100721,-0.051927196208874905
"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects. Modern methods of computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic will be used along with statistical methods to achieve the highest 'accuracy of pattern recognition. n/a",Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake,7022662,R21HL083052,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior test', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'biotechnology', 'caloric dietary content', 'calorimetry', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'human morbidity', 'human subject', 'mastication', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nutrient intake activity', 'nutrition related tag', 'obesity', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry', 'swallowing']",NHLBI,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,217756,-0.015097761695901123
"Sign Finder: Computer Vision to Find and Read Signs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build a device that enhances the mobility of visually impaired persons by finding and reading signs aloud without the need for infrastructure beyond ordinary signs. Using new computer vision techniques, it will detect and read text in images captured by a camera worn like a pendant around the user's neck.      We will build two commercially viable, self-contained consumer versions, a $1,500 device using consumer computers and cameras, and a $750 proprietary device.      In typical use, a wearer will select a mode (city street, supermarket) by pressing buttons and optionally speaking commands, and then either point the device at a scene, or scan the scene using auto-repeat image capture. The device will find and read signs, but only output audio for signs relevant to the mode.      The Phase II work plan has three tracks: 1) Computer vision software development and testing, 2) Human interface design and development, and 3) development and testing of the two forms of the device.       Continuing our collaboration from Phase I, we use Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center's expertise for human factors.

"Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant):                                                 The Applied Imagery, Pattern Recognition (AIPR) Workshop is held annually in         Washington, D.C., at the Cosmos Club.  This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).  The           goals of the meeting are the following: to provide technology transfer among         the three groups and to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of the            groups.  This is especially important in the area of validation of algorithms,       and the consequent need for databases that permit that validation.  Among the        specific topics to be covered at this meeting are: Real-time event                   understanding,  Extraction of information from video, video compression and          decompression, and hand and body gesture recognition.  A five-year period of         support is requested, to enable the meeting to grow in participation and             breadth of disciplines attracted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              n/a",Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop,6944025,R13CA093819,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer human interaction', 'videotape /videodisc', 'workshop']",NCI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R13,2005,5000,0.007740384638759027
"Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KIT Solutions, a private firm specializing in developing intelligent, Knowledge-based Information Technology (KIT) solutions for the field of health and human services will partner with the University of Pittsburgh, Office of Child Development (OCD) to develop a Web-based, interactive software application of a Family Support Management Information System (FS MIS) for nationwide dissemination. This innovation is called Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT).  Family support centers, like other human service programs and agencies across the country, are being required to implement best practices and document the impact of their services to funders, policy makers, and the community. However, most family centers do not have a state-of-the-art web-based information system available to them that integrates best practice, expert knowledge, and daily management functions. The proposed LIFT system will address these critical needs and has great potential for nationwide commercial distribution. The combination of KIT'S proven record of developing knowledge based information technology and OCD's over 20 years of research and practice in family support services will greatly enhances the chance of success for this business venture. In Phase I of the project, we will produce prototype software demonstrating the benefit, usability, and feasibility of a web-based, interactive, intelligent system for use by family support centers across the nation. The extent of which LIFT enables family center staff to build skill, capacity, access information and expert knowledge, to enhance their work will be the focus of this phase. In Phase II, we will fully develop the prototype LIFT to a commercial grade web application for nationwide dissemination and further validate the commercial potential and impact of LIFT, using a quasiexperimental design, which will involve a large number of users across multiple sites. In Phase III, we will seek private funding for marketing the system to the national market. We intend to use the Microsoft.Net Platform and follow XML web service concepts to develop the proposed innovation. Collection of a subscription fee will be used to support the maintenance and future development of the system. n/a","Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT)",6990440,R43HD049229,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'family', 'focus groups', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'social service']",NICHD,"KIT SOLUTIONS, INC.",R43,2005,104545,0.005371913905067989
"Intelligent Adaptive Wireless Reconfigurable EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant)  The overall goal of the proposal is to improve ambulatory and long-term EEG monitoring using an innovative wireless EEG system. The specific aim of this proposal is to develop an ambulatory wireless EEG monitoring system with real-time adaptive and re-configuration capabilities, which will allow more clinical data to be transmitted in the same bandwidth and in a small portable package. The proposed device will adapt its data acquisition hardware to the underlying clinical event permitting it to focus its high transmission rates to periods of clinically relevant events. The events will be detected by our powerful seizure monitor algorithm which will have direct control over a flexible and innovative hardware. The result is enhanced wireless EEG in a small package, low power and with data quality comparable to bulkier clinical tethered system. The ability to optimize bandwidth is timely due to new FDA telemetry guidelines, which restricts the availability of frequencies and bandwidths in medical devices. Another advantage to optimizing output is that more meaningful data can be created without excessively large data files, which will speed analysis and review. Finally, the proposed device will be able to dynamically reconfigure itself in real time to compensate for serious data-corrupting events such as when one or several electrodes become loose or detached. In summary, the two major innovations are: 1- Real-time adaptive capability for adjusting the quantity and quality of the acquired and transmitted EEG data to better reflect the underlying clinical event (such as a seizure), 2- more practical and accurate ambulatory monitoring by the real-time automatic reconfiguration of the EEG acquisition system.       In Phase I, we designed, fabricated and tested a prototype system. Bench top and clinical testing showed that the system can indeed modify its output in response to artifacts or changes in EEG morphology. In Phase II, we will complete development including a radio design that meets the new FDA guidelines, and test on long-term patients with epilepsy.               n/a",Intelligent Adaptive Wireless Reconfigurable EEG,6952455,R44NS042999,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electrodes', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'telemedicine', 'telemetry']",NINDS,"CLEVELAND MEDICAL DEVICES, INC.",R44,2005,671838,0.03744081842387174
"Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an innovative multi-microphone probe and acquisition system for recording otoacoustic emissions {OAEs} with advanced noise cancellation algorithms, increased frequency and intensity ranges and pressurization capabilities is proposed. Two advanced noise cancellation algorithm will be implemented: 1) a multi-reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) network and 2) two-dimensional filtering. These algorithms will utilize the independent measurements provided by the multiple microphones in order to reduce noise contaminants. Each microphone or microphone groupings will be connected to individual analog-to-digital (A/D) converters in order to allow for the implementation of the digital signal processing algorithms. The pressurization capabilities of the probe will allow implementation of tympanometry and the acquisition of OAEs while compensating for pressure imbalances between the outer and middle ear. Results from a prototype single microphone long probe are presented demonstrating that the design concept is valid and provides good quality OAE recordings while reducing the undesirable effects of the metal response. The proposed probe will also improve upon the limited dynamic and frequency range of current OAE probes. The probe is expected to be able to provide stimulus levels of up to 90 dB HL and a frequency response of up to 24 kHz. During Phase I, various probes will be constructed and tested under different noise conditions in adult and infant subjects. During Phase II, the pressurization capabilities of the new probe will be further developed and examined. The optimal probe designed will be implemented along with the optimal noise cancellation algorithm and tested in a comprehensive clinical study incorporating the pressurization capabilities of the probe. n/a",Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition,6933674,R43DC007543,"['adult human (21+)', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'ear disorder diagnosis', 'infant human (0-1 year)', 'mathematics', 'noise', 'otoacoustic emission', 'sound frequency']",NIDCD,INTELLIGENT HEARING SYSTEMS,R43,2005,100000,0.01615776120921262
"Vortex Tubed Thermocycler with Intelligent Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel system is proposed for the rapid identification of DNA. The system comprises of a unique thermocycler platform built around the extraordinary vortex tube, detection optics, intelligent software to provide users with information on most ideal operating conditions, and virtual insight into the PCR process as it progresses. An intelligent user interface will allow DNA amplification/detection on an unprecedented timescale (less than 10 minutes). A multi-disciplinary team that consists of a chemical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and two biochemists has been assembled for this project. The efficiency of the vortex tube will be optimized by the use of computational fluid dynamics. Heat transfer between the gas phase and the cuvets will be improved through computational fluid dynamic calculations. The intelligent software consists of a detailed mathematical model that uses similar starting conditions as the initial cuvet composition to model the amplification progress and it performs a virtual PCR in parallel with the actual process.

"Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Individuals with epilepsy, their families and the professionals that treat them have long felt the need for reliable warning of an impending epileptic seizure. In Phase I, we developed a unique, multi-parameter, individualized, trainable seizure predetection system which extracts spectral, wavelet and time domain features and uses recurrent neural networks to analyze many hours of multichannel EEG and predetect seizure onsets with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The underlying analytical software for this system was tested on large database of scalp EEG recordings from five epilepsy centers and contained over 373 hours of recordings from 17 patients containing 50 seizures. This is a large database compared to those reported by most investigators in this field. Phase I results were very accurate and reliable (sensitivity: 100%, false positive rate 0.02/hr and detection times that occurred an average of 9.1 seconds, before seizure onset). This is entirely acceptable for our primary target application, of warning of a seizure onset to enable timely diagnostic injection to locate the brain region where the seizure starts using SPECT imaging. In Phase II we will refine the detection process, validate performance in a large data set, implement the software in C++ modules, and test the commercial prototype in a clinical setting. These steps will result in a company supported Phase III product development, integration into existing EEG recording systems, beta testing and commercialization. While Phase 2 will concentrate on the SPECT application using scalp electrodes, the scalp EEG techniques developed will be applicable without change for general use in an epilepsy monitoring facility to alert staff of impending seizures and allow them to attend to patient safety in a timely manner. Predetection will also facilitate neuropsychological or other testing in the epilepsy monitoring environment.

"Just in Time Information for Exercise Adoption DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A novel personal digital assistant (PDA)-based system that can automatically detect bouts of moderate or greater walking and deliver health behavior change information to users to increase their levels of physical activity will be developed and evaluated. The system will be an extension of work already performed by the investigators, and will incorporate a validated wireless motion sensor, pattern classification software to identify bouts of walking, and a personified, relational user interface designed to maintain engagement and trust in the tailored behavior change information delivered to users over multiple interactions. The system will be designed to be worn and used continuously by free-living populations and provide users with health behavior change information at the moment it is needed.      Users will interact with the PDA via a simulated face-to-face conversation with the animated relational agent, and will conduct a daily progress review and goal-setting session at which time they will schedule specific times they intend to walk on the following day (bouts of 10 minutes or more of moderate or greater intensity). If they complete a scheduled walk, the agent provides immediate social reinforcement. If they fail to initiate a walk at a scheduled time the agent engages them in a problem-solving session in which it attempts to help them overcome the specific obstacle to exercise they are experiencing.

"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,6959048,K22LM008794,"['antigen antibody reaction', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanotechnology', 'pore forming protein', 'protein quantitation /detection']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2005,162000,-0.011484134100369194
"Development of Ultrasonic Appratus for Dental Diagnosis DESCRIPTION: An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus has been proposed for Dental applications in determining tooth pathologies such as demineralization/caries, hidden fractures, and formation of abscesses. The equipment adopts a piezoelectric and laser optic hybrid transduction system for interrogation of teeth. Ultrasonic responses of the tooth structure will be analyzed by a pattern recognition expert system (artificial intelligence) to determine the diagnosis of the tooth inspected. The proposed research will eventually help to reduce the use of harmful X-ray radiation in Dental clinics and contribute to artificial intelligence based diagnosis. The proposed concept has been successfully demonstrated in the previous Phase I study.

"A Laser-Based Device for Work Site Stability Assessment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A laser-based acoustic emission (AE) detection device is proposed (Phase I & II) for work site structural stability assessment in order to reduce the occupational injuries and fatalities caused by roof falls, sidewall crumples, stop collapses, slope slides, etc., in the mining industry. This applied research and development addresses the miner's safety and contributes to ensuring the mineworker's right to ""safe and healthful working conditions"" (Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970). This new device will take advantage of innovations in laser ultrasonic, artificial intelligence (AI) and conventional acoustic emission technology to provide mine workers with a unique instant, real time stability assessment of immediate rock structures in the working environment, which was not attainable in the past. This research will also result in a unique non-contact monitoring device for acoustic emission/microseismic studies, which will be very useful in many areas of application. The primary objective of the Phase I research is to demonstrate under laboratory conditions the concept of the laser device for stability assessment, and to construct a prototype setup for further development and optimization in the subsequent Phase II research. This primary objective consists of five specific aims: 1. Specimen preparation, 2. Development of laser-based AE monitor, 3. AE data collection and failure criteria development, 4. laboratory demonstration, and 5. final report and Phase II proposal. n/a",A Laser-Based Device for Work Site Stability Assessment,6730974,R43OH007662,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'human mortality', 'injury prevention', 'interferometry', 'lasers', 'mechanical stress', 'minings', 'monitoring device', 'occupational hazard', 'occupational health /safety', 'sound perception', 'technology /technique development', 'ultrasonography', 'work site']",NIOSH,AAC INTERNATIONAL,R43,2004,99998,0.06915574603506988
"Sign Finder: Computer Vision to Find and Read Signs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build a device that enhances the mobility of visually impaired persons by finding and reading signs aloud without the need for infrastructure beyond ordinary signs. Using new computer vision techniques, it will detect and read text in images captured by a camera worn like a pendant around the user's neck.      We will build two commercially viable, self-contained consumer versions, a $1,500 device using consumer computers and cameras, and a $750 proprietary device.      In typical use, a wearer will select a mode (city street, supermarket) by pressing buttons and optionally speaking commands, and then either point the device at a scene, or scan the scene using auto-repeat image capture. The device will find and read signs, but only output audio for signs relevant to the mode.      The Phase II work plan has three tracks: 1) Computer vision software development and testing, 2) Human interface design and development, and 3) development and testing of the two forms of the device.

"Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In the United States, myocardial ischemia is the underlying etiology in nearly 70% of the 5 million patients suffering from mechanical failure of the cardiac left ventricle (LV). Echocardiography (echo) is well suited for the analysis of LV function, however, the problem of conveying this clinically important information in a quantitative, objective, and reproducible manner persists.      To address this problem and respond to the NIH PA-00-117 solicitation for innovations in biomedical information science and technology, the long-term goal of the proposed R21/R33 project is to develop methods for 1) quantitative and objective measurement of LV function, 2) reproducible diagnostic interpretation based on these measurements, and 3) standardized topologic mapping and parametric display of the results. We defined 3 parameters of LV function: 1) rate of local deformation (strain rate), 2) amplitude of deformation (strain), and 3) time interval to the transition (crossover) point of cyclic deformation.      The practical implementation of the long-term objectives will be achieved through the development of a Multiparametric Computational Echo (MPCE) system. The main hypothesis of this R21/R33 project is that the MPCE system will a) precisely and accurately quantitate (R21 phase) and b) reproducibly clinically interpret (R33 phase) segmental LV function. This hypothesis will be tested on digital echo data from animal models and clinical cases of myocardial ischemia representing a wide range of segmental LV dysfunction.      Specific Aims (R21 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop algorithms for parametric analysis of local ventricular function (Year 1).   Aim 2 - Test precision and accuracy of local LV functional analysis using MPCE (Year 2).   Satisfaction of the predefined milestones will initiate the commencement of the R33 phase.      Specific Aims (R33 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop a neural network MPCE system and test it initially in animals (Year 3).   Aim 2 - Refine parametric mapping and test reproducibility of MPCE data in humans (Year 4).   Successful completion of this project will result in noninvasive, quantitative, objective, and reproducible interpretation of LV function, thus facilitating optimal diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in cardiology. n/a",Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography,6783325,R21HL070363,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'echocardiography', 'evaluation /testing', 'heart function', 'human subject', 'method development', 'swine']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC,R21,2004,144693,0.0011811348401254327
"Physiological Controller for Rotary Blood Pumps DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    As the prospects of chronic mechanical assistance for the failing human heart are fast becoming a reality, and patients are indeed returning home to regain a normal lifestyle, the limitations of this technology upon quality of life are becoming more apparent. To address many of these limitations, investigators are developing next-generation ventricular assist devices. Based on turbopump technology, these new devices offer smaller size, greater efficiency (hence smaller batteries), high reliability, and are more cost effective as compared to their pulsatile predecessors. For all the virtues of these new turbopumps, they bring additional challenges. Arguably the most urgent is the need for added ""intelligence."" These relatively ignorant devices are highly dependent on feedback-control to provide normal physiological response. The goal of the Phase- II effort proposed herein is to design a robust controller that may be incorporated into these turbodynamic pump systems for clinical use. The primary end product of this program would be a validated algorithm, in the form of firmware that will be embedded into existing rotary pump controller -- capable of maintaining optimal perfusion of the patient under a variety of hemodynamic demands and disturbances, while avoiding deleterious conditions such as ventricular suction. n/a",Physiological Controller for Rotary Blood Pumps,6803953,R44HL066656,"['artificial intelligence', 'auxiliary heart prosthesis', 'biomedical device power system', 'biomedical equipment development', 'cardiac output', 'circulatory assist', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cow', 'electrophysiology', 'hemolysis', 'mathematical model', 'microprocessor /microchip', 'sheep']",NHLBI,"LAUNCHPOINT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2004,374766,0.020158846886983894
"Intelligent Adaptive Wireless Reconfigurable EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant)  The overall goal of the proposal is to improve ambulatory and long-term EEG monitoring using an innovative wireless EEG system. The specific aim of this proposal is to develop an ambulatory wireless EEG monitoring system with real-time adaptive and re-configuration capabilities, which will allow more clinical data to be transmitted in the same bandwidth and in a small portable package. The proposed device will adapt its data acquisition hardware to the underlying clinical event permitting it to focus its high transmission rates to periods of clinically relevant events. The events will be detected by our powerful seizure monitor algorithm which will have direct control over a flexible and innovative hardware. The result is enhanced wireless EEG in a small package, low power and with data quality comparable to bulkier clinical tethered system. The ability to optimize bandwidth is timely due to new FDA telemetry guidelines, which restricts the availability of frequencies and bandwidths in medical devices. Another advantage to optimizing output is that more meaningful data can be created without excessively large data files, which will speed analysis and review. Finally, the proposed device will be able to dynamically reconfigure itself in real time to compensate for serious data-corrupting events such as when one or several electrodes become loose or detached. In summary, the two major innovations are: 1- Real-time adaptive capability for adjusting the quantity and quality of the acquired and transmitted EEG data to better reflect the underlying clinical event (such as a seizure), 2- more practical and accurate ambulatory monitoring by the real-time automatic reconfiguration of the EEG acquisition system.       In Phase I, we designed, fabricated and tested a prototype system. Bench top and clinical testing showed that the system can indeed modify its output in response to artifacts or changes in EEG morphology. In Phase II, we will complete development including a radio design that meets the new FDA guidelines, and test on long-term patients with epilepsy.               n/a",Intelligent Adaptive Wireless Reconfigurable EEG,6888368,R44NS042999,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electrodes', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'telemedicine', 'telemetry']",NINDS,"CLEVELAND MEDICAL DEVICES, INC.",R44,2004,416347,0.03744081842387174
"Wireless EEG/PSG System with Novel Artifact Removal DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): EEG is a valuable non-invasive clinical tool in numerous applications, from the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases to the clinical monitoring of neurological injuries, sleep disorders and depth of anesthesia.  However, EEG signals are very susceptible to various artifacts which seriously impede the EEG interpretation and compromise its therapeutic capabilities. Methods currently employed for removing artifacts from EEG recordings are not clinically effective or feasible for real-time and long-term neuro-monitoring. Hence, the overall goal of this project is to develop a novel, high-fidelity artifact identification and removal technique that will be specifically useful for ambulatory EEG recording and intervention.      The proposed novel artifact removal technique is based on the Wavelet-Based Artifact Removal (WBAR) method, which exploits the excellent time-frequency localization of artifacts provided by the wavelet decomposition. The WBAR method is computationally very efficient and allows for simultaneous, real-time removal of a variety of EEG artifacts. It has been recently developed by the PI and tested for a single EEG channel in an extensive clinical study as part of a novel depth-of-anesthesia monitor.       The WBAR method will be improved by combining it with the Wavelet Neural Networks for the precise artifact classification, and recursive EEG Parameterization methods for the reliable estimation of the corrupted EEG components. The combination of these methods will result in fully automated, real-timeartifact removal technique that maximally preserves valid EEG information.       The development and implementation of this novel method will greatly enhance the functionality and  utilization of Cleveland Medical Devices' entire line of ambulatory wireless EEG/PSG systems. n/a",Wireless EEG/PSG System with Novel Artifact Removal,6792393,R43NS046978,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'brain electrical activity', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'electroencephalography', 'human subject', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research', 'polysomnography', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'sleep']",NINDS,"CLEVELAND MEDICAL DEVICES, INC.",R43,2004,204478,-0.0036674361422849564
"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6780874,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', 'age difference', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'brain electrical activity', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'newborn human (0-6 weeks)', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2004,194888,-0.0025546218025277686
"Optimized Retinal Camera DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A low-cost, high-resolution, high-contrast color digital camera optimized for ophthalmology will be demonstrated. This Optimized Retinal Camera will be specifically tested for its effectiveness in meeting the image quality requirements for the screening and assessment of pre-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both traditional clinical settings and in telemedicine. The proposed device exploits recent technological advances in high sensitivity charge coupled device (CCD) cameras and digital signal processing electronics. Today's CCD cameras do not have the dynamic range to image the human retina. The human retina is characterized by regions of high reflectivity (20-40 percent), such as the optic disc, and very low reflectivity (<2 percent), such as the macula and fovea. Further, these existing digital cameras treat each of the color channels in the same manner and do not consider the special, red-saturated characteristics of the retina. The approach builds on existing fundus imaging technology developed by Kestrel for the National Eye Institute. The proposed Optimized Retinal Camera will be shown to offer significant improvement over existing digital color cameras by addressing each of the deficiencies mentioned above.

Heat transfer between the gas phase and the cuvets will be improved through computational fluid dynamic calculations. The intelligent software consists of a detailed mathematical model that uses similar starting conditions as the initial cuvet composition to model the amplification progress and it performs a virtual PCR in parallel with the actual process.

"Tree Ensemble Regression and Classification Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This SBIR aims to produce next generation classification and regression software based upon ensembles of decision trees: bagging, random forests, and boosting. The prediction accuracy of these methods has caused much excitement in the machine learning community, and both challenges and complements the data modeling culture prevalent among biostatisticians. Recent research extends the methodology to likelihood based methods used in biostatistics, leading to models for survival data and generalized forest models. Generalized forest models extend regression forests in the same way that generalized linear models extend linear models.      This software would apply broadly, including to medical diagnosis, prognostic modeling, and detecting cancer; and for modeling patient characteristics like blood pressure, discrete responses in clinical trials, and count data.      Phase I work will prototype software for survival data, and investigate the performance of ensemble methods on simulated and real data.

"A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this work is to provide a novel probabilistic computational engine for docking-based virtual screening. The engine is based on probabilistic model of Markov Random Fieds (MRF). MRF's have proven successful in other fields such as Computer Vision, and can be seen as a 3D analog of the successful 1D application of Hidden Markov Models to bioinformatics. The docking of a rigid ligand or ligand fragment into a protein active site is modeled as a weighted graphical match of an abstracted description of the ligand to an abstracted description of the active site. These abstracted descriptions are graphs, whose nodes are chemical entities (hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, hydrophobic spheres and etc.) and whose edges are associated distance constraints. The weighted graph-matching problem is expressed as an MRF, whose solution minimizes its associated free energy function. A fast, convergent message-passing scheme called Belief Propagation is used to solve the MRF. The result is a probability distribution that describes all possible placements of the ligand into the active site. Individual low-energy placements of the molecule are obtained by marginalizing this probability distribution. The method provides a fast and mathematically complete examination of possible fits of the ligand into the protein active site, and our prototype MRF application demonstrates excellent timing and completeness properties. The method also provides an attractive data structure enabling a variety of applications. The data structure intrinsically admits an enriched description of the active site. This description can incorporate an extended set of chemical substructures for matching at its nodes. It also can incorporate sets of probabilistic beliefs, expressed as probabilistic prior distributions. These can be used to bias matches according to known actives. Our goals in Phase I are to further develop our prototype into a robust MRF-based docking engine to positioning rigid molecules and molecular fragments into protein active sites. Our goals in Phase II will be to implement applications based on the MRF docking engine: (i) inclusion flexible ligand docking, (ii) incorporation of flexible side chains into docking, (iii) de-novo ligand design, and (iv) docking into multiple aligned proteins. We will seek corporate partners interested in collaborating on applying the technologies to specific problems in drug discovery in Phase I1.

"Permutation Test Software for Randomized Clinical Trials The randomized clinical trial (RCT) is arguably the linchpin of the drug development process, and the results of an RCT are almost always analyzed using some form of statistical hypothesis test. The most frequently used hypothesis tests assume a population model for statistical inference, even though a randomization model is more consistent with real-world characteristics of RCTs. Approximate p- values returned by population-model tests can, under certain circumstances, be misleading, resulting in effective drugs being declared ineffective, or ineffective drugs being declared effective.

"Vector Quantization for Image Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This Phase-I SBIR application addresses the increasingly significant challenges faced by pathologists and clinicians in manually inspecting microscope slides. Microscopic inspection suffers from being labor-intensive, subjective, expensive and limited by the need for physical access to the glass slide specimen of interest. The obstacle to automated microscopic inspection has been the inability to efficiently digitize entire microscope specimens at high resolutions. Aperio has developed the ScanScope (R), a novel microscope slide scanner that makes it practical - for the first time - to rapidly create virtual microscope slides at high resolutions. Virtual slides set the stage for automating microscopic inspection using automated pattern recognition. This research aims to adapt and optimize Aperio's existing and novel algorithms for vector quantization (VQ) to the problem of automatic pattern recognition in virtual slides. VQ is a general mathematical technique for encoding bitstreams using a vocabulary. The primary aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of using VQ for pattern recognition in a practical and well-characterized application: automatically finding virtually all micrometastasis clusters in cytology specimens. This proposed research represents a first attempt to automate pattern recognition in virtual slides using VQ.         n/a",Vector Quantization for Image Pattern Recognition,6695147,R43EB001617,"['artificial intelligence', ' automated data processing', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cell line', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cytology', ' digital imaging', ' high throughput technology', ' metastasis', ' microscopy', ' nomenclature']",NIBIB,"APERIO TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2003,97269,0.003980106530210087
"Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In the United States, myocardial ischemia is the underlying etiology in nearly 70% of the 5 million patients suffering from mechanical failure of the cardiac left ventricle (LV). Echocardiography (echo) is well suited for the analysis of LV function, however, the problem of conveying this clinically important information in a quantitative, objective, and reproducible manner persists.      To address this problem and respond to the NIH PA-00-117 solicitation for innovations in biomedical information science and technology, the long-term goal of the proposed R21/R33 project is to develop methods for 1) quantitative and objective measurement of LV function, 2) reproducible diagnostic interpretation based on these measurements, and 3) standardized topologic mapping and parametric display of the results. We defined 3 parameters of LV function: 1) rate of local deformation (strain rate), 2) amplitude of deformation (strain), and 3) time interval to the transition (crossover) point of cyclic deformation.      The practical implementation of the long-term objectives will be achieved through the development of a Multiparametric Computational Echo (MPCE) system. The main hypothesis of this R21/R33 project is that the MPCE system will a) precisely and accurately quantitate (R21 phase) and b) reproducibly clinically interpret (R33 phase) segmental LV function. This hypothesis will be tested on digital echo data from animal models and clinical cases of myocardial ischemia representing a wide range of segmental LV dysfunction.      Specific Aims (R21 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop algorithms for parametric analysis of local ventricular function (Year 1).   Aim 2 - Test precision and accuracy of local LV functional analysis using MPCE (Year 2).   Satisfaction of the predefined milestones will initiate the commencement of the R33 phase.      Specific Aims (R33 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop a neural network MPCE system and test it initially in animals (Year 3).   Aim 2 - Refine parametric mapping and test reproducibility of MPCE data in humans (Year 4).   Successful completion of this project will result in noninvasive, quantitative, objective, and reproducible interpretation of LV function, thus facilitating optimal diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in cardiology. n/a",Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography,6688878,R21HL070363,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' echocardiography', ' evaluation /testing', ' heart function', ' human subject', ' method development', ' swine']",NHLBI,"MAYO CLINIC COLL OF MEDICINE, ROCHESTER",R21,2003,136861,0.0011811348401254327
"Optical Detection of Intravenous Infiltration  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 80% of hospital patients in the United States require IV therapy and 50% of IV lines fail due to infiltration, a clot in the cannula, an inflammatory response of the vein, or separation of the cannula from the vein. IV infiltration is usually accompanied by pain, erythema, and swelling at the cannula tip or the insertion site. Severe infiltration may lead to necrosis requiring skin debridement, skin grafting, or amputation. Early detection of infiltration prevents the occurrence of serious incidents that may require surgical correction. The long-term objective of this project is to develop an infiltration sensor for monitoring IV failures. The Phase II research design includes the development of an advanced prototype, improvement of algorithms, evaluation of the prototype on animal models and human measurements, investigation of its accuracy and utility, and the examination of the commercial potential. The innovation of this project lies in the use of an optical method coupled with the advanced development in fiber optics and algorithms for tissue optics to provide a means for noninvasive monitoring of the IV sites.

"Physiological Controller for Rotary Blood Pumps DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    As the prospects of chronic mechanical assistance for the failing human heart are fast becoming a reality, and patients are indeed returning home to regain a normal lifestyle, the limitations of this technology upon quality of life are becoming more apparent. To address many of these limitations, investigators are developing next-generation ventricular assist devices. Based on turbopump technology, these new devices offer smaller size, greater efficiency (hence smaller batteries), high reliability, and are more cost effective as compared to their pulsatile predecessors. For all the virtues of these new turbopumps, they bring additional challenges. Arguably the most urgent is the need for added ""intelligence."" These relatively ignorant devices are highly dependent on feedback-control to provide normal physiological response. The goal of the Phase- II effort proposed herein is to design a robust controller that may be incorporated into these turbodynamic pump systems for clinical use. The primary end product of this program would be a validated algorithm, in the form of firmware that will be embedded into existing rotary pump controller -- capable of maintaining optimal perfusion of the patient under a variety of hemodynamic demands and disturbances, while avoiding deleterious conditions such as ventricular suction. n/a",Physiological Controller for Rotary Blood Pumps,6690298,R44HL066656,"['artificial intelligence', ' auxiliary heart prosthesis', ' biomedical device power system', ' biomedical equipment development', ' cardiac output', ' circulatory assist', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cow', ' electrophysiology', ' hemolysis', ' mathematical model', ' microprocessor /microchip', ' sheep']",NHLBI,"LAUNCHPOINT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2003,370076,0.020158846886983894

For individuals with visual impairments that are unable to walk with a long cane or walker, the SPAM will provide safe travel by assisting the user to avoid obstacles. This research will build on the investigative team's previous experience with power assistance for manual wheelchairs and obstacle avoidance for power wheelchairs and rollators.

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6642804,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2003,193637,-0.0025546218025277686
"Automated Quantitation of 3D Echocardiograms In Phase I we developed a method for automated border detection (ABD) of echocardiographic scans that is feasible for clinical application. The accuracy of our processes provides exceeds Phase I goals and is comparable to interobserver variability in measuring volume and ejection fraction, and in border location. For a diverse set of patients, we have achieved an accuracy of 10 ml for endocardial volume, 4% for ejection fraction, and ,2.0 mm for border position. Our processes operates in 4 min. In Phase II we propose to continue research and development to move our ABD technology closer to clinical user. Our first specific aim is to reduce the amount of manual input required even further. Our second aim is to develop a prototype system suitable for clinical evaluation. Our third aim is to perform a pilot trial to evaluate the performance of our ABD process, as a preparation for a more formal, multi-center clinical trial planned for Phase III. The proposed research is important because quantitative 3D echo provides greater accuracy and reproducibility and more comprehensive information on cardiac status than currently available imaging techniques. The significant advantages of 3D echo are not currently available for clinical practice because it is impractical without automation. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Automation of echocardiogram border detection enables physicians to obtain accurate, reproducible and comprehensive measurements of the heart's size, shape and function.

"Optimized Retinal Camera DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A low-cost, high-resolution, high-contrast color digital camera optimized for ophthalmology will be demonstrated. This Optimized Retinal Camera will be specifically tested for its effectiveness in meeting the image quality requirements for the screening and assessment of pre-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both traditional clinical settings and in telemedicine. The proposed device exploits recent technological advances in high sensitivity charge coupled device (CCD) cameras and digital signal processing electronics. Today's CCD cameras do not have the dynamic range to image the human retina. The human retina is characterized by regions of high reflectivity (20-40 percent), such as the optic disc, and very low reflectivity (<2 percent), such as the macula and fovea. Further, these existing digital cameras treat each of the color channels in the same manner and do not consider the special, red-saturated characteristics of the retina. The approach builds on existing fundus imaging technology developed by Kestrel for the National Eye Institute. The proposed Optimized Retinal Camera will be shown to offer significant improvement over existing digital color cameras by addressing each of the deficiencies mentioned above.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6633609,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2003,618638,0.03000274041464299

"Actuarial Generation of Diagnostic Possibilities in Ment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary goal of this Phase I project is to test the feasibility of a computerized diagnostic tool for collaborative assessment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.  Such a system is sorely needed in both clinical and research settings because (a) structured clinical interviews, although the gold standard in diagnosis, are time consuming and underutilized, and (b) the clinical judgment that is often substituted is of Limited accuracy and subject to several significant biases.  Using the diagnostic rules from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), the proposed product will provide clinicians with automated actuarial symptom and diagnostic data thereby circumventing these limitations while assisting the collaborative diagnostic process.  These goals will be accomplished by integrating a reliable and valid symptom checklist filled out by patient informants with an advanced rule-based documentation system that employs an established logic-processing engine and which utilizes the complete DSM-IV rule set.  Based on the presence and severity of discrete symptoms, clinicians will be provided with actuarially derived probability values that indicate the likelihood of specific DSM-IV criteria or disorders.  Additionally, it will facilitate rapid and complete documentation DSM-IV criterion necessary to formally validate or refute diagnoses.  The improved integration of client and clinician information will provide increased diagnostic precision and facilitate collaboration between providers and clients.  In Phase II, the system will be extended to support repeated assessment, direct access via the World Wide Web, and larger sampling to collect further psychometric information.  Phase I objectives include: 1. To produce a highly usable collaborative diagnostic assessment tool that will be used by individual practitioners, small group practices and their clients.  2. To automate the determination of the positive and negative predictive power of informant symptom data for corresponding DSM-IV criterion and diagnoses, and to collect an initial data set to evaluate usability and psychometric properties of the system.  Phase II objectives include: (1) creation of a user interfaces and program logic to support repeated assessment (2) scaling to provide direct access via the World Wide Web and (3) larger sampling to extend the known psychometric properties of the system.

"Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System A cancer genetics-tracking database will be redesigned using usability engineering techniques to improve the functionality and usability of the current system. This is important because it will lead to a system that is easier to use and learn, will decrease the chance of errors, and will increase productivity, and user satisfaction. The current state of informatics offers the potential for the creation of tools to assist in the reduction of medical errors. The redesign of this tracking database will be completed through a three-phase process. The first phase will use the results of a usability analysis to redesign and prototype the cancer genetics-tracking database. In the second phase, usability studies will then be conducted to ensure that the system is functional, easy to use, easy to learn, and meets the goals of the users. The usability studies will include heuristic evaluations, keystroke level models, talk-aloud methods, and cognitive walkthrough techniques. The system will be modified based upon the results of these studies. Research will be compiled on the advantages and disadvantages of ICD coding Vs. SNOMED followed by the selection of the most useful system for coding medical information. In the third phase the final redesign will be compared to the old system using a within-subject design to determine if the redesign decreases the error rate, increases productivity, and user satisfaction. This will be followed-up with a survey to determine the perceived usability of the redesigned application. Throughout the redesign process, specific usability guidelines will be developed for designing healthcare software that is computational and knowledge- based in nature.  n/a",Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System,6538226,F38LM007188,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer information system', ' cancer registry /resource', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' family genetics', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,F38,2002,66954,0.0031902438166822003
"COMMUNICATION AID UTILIZING WORD LEVEL DISAMBIGUATION There are approximately 2.5 million people in the US who are speech impaired to the extent that it is considered a functional limitation.  Today, many people with severe communication disabilities lack access to electronic and even printed material, have a lack of opportunity for interaction and opportunity for self-advocacy, and experience isolation.  Providing accessibility to wireless voice, data and Internet communications directly from the device is of tremendous importance to people with severe communication disabilities. The primary objective under the Phase I grant was to investigate the potential of word-level disambiguation technology for text generation on a communication aid to meet the needs of many individuals requiring augmentative and alternative communication (AAC).  Phase I findings validated T9 technology as a viable method for text generation and also AAC device users want to access wireless voice, data and Internet communications directly from the device.  The specific aims of Phase II are to: investigate hardware platforms for AAC device host candidates, develop Windows software modules for T9 and AAC, develop portable AAC resources, integrate wireless voice and data communications, and conduct usability testing of the product as it develops. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION The outcome of Phase II will be a communication aid device for production in Phase III that is based on commercially available hardware with minimal custom AAC hardware support.  The goal is that the software platform developed in Phase II will be ported to existing low-cost hardware as much as possible to: make use of newly developed platforms, provide more choice to AAC device users, provide more flexibility in user interface, and reduce overall device costs to the end user when commercially manufactured.  n/a",COMMUNICATION AID UTILIZING WORD LEVEL DISAMBIGUATION,6569890,R44RR013191,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical biomedical equipment', ' clinical research', ' communication disorder aid', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' computer system hardware', ' human subject', ' online computer', ' vocabulary', ' voice']",NCRR,"MADENTEC (USA), INC.",R44,2002,139082,0.0450391126645315
"Diagnostic Logic and Adaptive Assessment for Psychiatry  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This SBIR Phase I application proposes to extend an existing multi-tier Internet client-server system (""CliniMetricar"") by integrating active diagnostic logic.  CliniMetrica currently provides systematic psychiatric assessment using the World Health Organization (WHO) Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, version 2.1). CliniMetrica automatically indexes digital audio recording of assessment interviews, and was developed with SBIR support from NIMH Digital video functions are currently being implemented and tested with additional NIMH support, as are functions to support remote psychometrics for the training and monitoring of interviewers.  The CliniMetrica system is increasing in sophistication and functionality, and has applications for clinical research (e.g., clinical trials) as well as for more routine clinical practice.  The current lack of fully developed and tested diagnostic functionality is a major gap.  A number of potential customers have requested integrated DSM-IV and/or lCD-10 diagnostic results to be automatically linked to assessments.  In order to meet this market need, we propose to implement the DSM-IV and ICD-10 nosologic systems as two classification knowledge bases that a logic engine will process to generate diagnostic results.  These logical functions are difficult to implement and manipulate with procedural languages (e. g. C + +). so the use of a logic engine provides significant technical benefits.  This diagnostic logic version of CliniMetrica is referred to as ""CliniMetrica-Dx.""  To assist raters in thorough examination and to support adaptive assessment, a user interface coupled to logic processing modules will allow tracking the diagnostic status of a subject (the sets of true, false, partially true, or partially false DSM-IV and lCD-10 diagnoses during assessment.  The logic engine will dynamically generate assessment item subsets (currently from the SCAN) needed to rule-in or rule-out DSM-IV and lCD-10 diagnoses. During the assessment, presentation of these symptom sets to the assessor can further guide the interview. By narrowing the ""search space,"" the efficiency of assessments will be increased. By formalizing the search, reliability and validity can be enhanced In addition, to provide support for nosologic research and development, in Phase II the system will include mappings between DSM-IV and lCD-10, and between current and future versions of the DSM and lCD.  The CliniMetrica-Dx system as an application framework will generalize to other clinical psychiatric assessment instruments such as the SCID, to adaptive self-report systems, and to other medical specialties.  It also will have applications for education and training.   n/a",Diagnostic Logic and Adaptive Assessment for Psychiatry,6549963,R43MH066434,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' human subject', ' indexing', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' psychometrics']",NIMH,"MEDICAL DECISION LOGIC, INC.",R43,2002,94169,0.011668312757464916
"Genomic application of suspension array technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The principle of the proposed project is the application of fluorescent microsphere based suspension array technology (SAT) to the cytometry based simultaneous detection of multi analytes. The proposal consists of four overlapping subprojects: (a) Technological development of biological microbead procedures using cells or microorganisms as substitutes for polymeric microspheres to lower the cost of SAT compared to the cost of methods using microbeads manufactured by polymer chemistry. (b) Development of a test to detect gene translocations and rearragements frequently responsible for malignant transformations. A method based on measuring bead-based hybridization of specific 5' and 3' nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of chromosomal translocation breakpoints would allow large scale screening of leukemias and various types of cancers by the measurement of 5'/3' sequence ratio. (c) Development of a DNA binding protein profiling assay providing easy, reproducible and high throughput technology to determine the expression pattern of transcription factors (TFs) binding to single stranded hexamere oligonucleotide sequences anchored to the solid phase surface of microspheres. This subproject is at the R&D level and needs to be thoroughly tested. (d) Development of artificial neural network software applications to analyze and classify the ""fingerprint patterns"" produced by the SAT measurements in subprojects (b) and (c).

"A Personal Status Monitor for the Home The purpose of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a portable and completely wireless system that detects, processes, and analyzes muscle activity for remotely monitoring the functional status of an individual. The Personal Status Monitor (PSM) will remotely monitor the use of muscles during the exertion of motor tasks in a continuous and unobstructed fashion. Through pattern recognition of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals, the PSM will provide the caregiver with an objective parametric measure of how physically active their patient has been, such as walling, sitting, personal care, and feeding. The PSM will consist of three components: 1) four wireless EMG sensors, 2) a body worn transceiver (Repeater), and 3) the Base Station, which processes the signals for pattern recognition and feature extraction. The information can be sent to a remote location via telephone lines or the Internet. The specific aims of this program for Phase II are: Aim 1: To continue with Phase I development of the pattern recognition algorithms in patients with stroke; Aim 2: Design and build a working prototype of the hardware and software for the PSM; and Aim 3: Field test the prototype wireless system among stroke patients in the home environment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The MA will primarily augment clinical service by making the line an effective place for rehabilitation. In addition, the PSM will have direct applicability to the field of ergonomics for work-site assessment, or in sports or recreational activities as a feedback device to facilitate training of skilled movements. Numerous other applications in the field of rehabilitation could include monitoring of drug therapies for tremor or other neuromuscular conditions, or home-exercise compliance.

For individuals with visual impairments that are unable to walk with a long cane or walker, the SPAM will provide safe travel by assisting the user to avoid obstacles.

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6529026,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2002,193637,-0.0025546218025277686
"Automated Quantitation of 3D Echocardiograms In Phase I we developed a method for automated border detection (ABD) of echocardiographic scans that is feasible for clinical application. The accuracy of our processes provides exceeds Phase I goals and is comparable to interobserver variability in measuring volume and ejection fraction, and in border location. For a diverse set of patients, we have achieved an accuracy of 10 ml for endocardial volume, 4% for ejection fraction, and ,2.0 mm for border position. Our processes operates in 4 min. In Phase II we propose to continue research and development to move our ABD technology closer to clinical user. Our first specific aim is to reduce the amount of manual input required even further. Our second aim is to develop a prototype system suitable for clinical evaluation. Our third aim is to perform a pilot trial to evaluate the performance of our ABD process, as a preparation for a more formal, multi-center clinical trial planned for Phase III. The proposed research is important because quantitative 3D echo provides greater accuracy and reproducibility and more comprehensive information on cardiac status than currently available imaging techniques. The significant advantages of 3D echo are not currently available for clinical practice because it is impractical without automation. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Automation of echocardiogram border detection enables physicians to obtain accurate, reproducible and comprehensive measurements of the heart's size, shape and function.

"Digital Elevation Models for Population Estimates Research exploring the feasibility of deriving population estimates from remotely sensed data demonstrates that objects in the urban landscape can be identified and incorporated into a population estimates system based on the housing unit method. Nonetheless, this research also reveals shortcomings in the technology producing the input files used in the automatic detection of objects. The problem involves the assumption and techniques used when converting high resolution images into digital elevation models (DEM). DEM files serve as input to the programs used in the detection of housing units. Efforts to correctly identify housing units are time-consuming and error-prone without clear and distinct DEMs. The objectives of this Phase I SBIR application are to further refine strengthen and test the software employed in transforming satellite and aerial imagery into digital elevation model (DEMs).

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6514339,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2002,582434,0.03000274041464299
"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system. All have expressed a keen interest in becoming corporate partners for Phase III. Two are currently using our prototype system in their production environments today. We are submitting this grant request to partially cover the cost of constructing and testing the system.

This workshop brings together 60-80           members of academia, industry, and other federal agencies, with a particular         history of involvement with the broader intelligence community in image              processing and analysis.  The workshop format for the last decade has                generally involved three days of high-quality presentations and investigator         interaction, both formally and informally at evening meeting receptions held         at the Cosmos Club.  The 30th meeting will be held from October 10-12, 2001,         and focus on Time-Varying Imagery.  This has particular relevance to medical         imaging, as it is increasingly being used to describe intrinsically-varying          physiologic phenomena (e.g., blood flow, intra-operative conditions).

"ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR Imaging detectors for 10 to 150 keV photons have many uses in medical technology, including tumor imaging, SPECT, and radiography. Digital output is particularly useful since it allows image enhancement, analysis, transmission and storage. In Phase I we proposed a new technology that could capture images with 100 microm spatial resolution and 1 keV energy resolution or better. This capability would facilitate entirely new classes of medical diagnostic procedures, particularly for transgenic small animal imaging. Our Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In this Phase II effort, collaborating with Paul Luke at LBNL, we will construct 1 cm thick crossed-strip HPGe detectors having 10 x 10 strips, each 2 mm x 20 mm. We will develop cooled FET preamplifiers having low noise and large bandwidth properties specifically required by this approach. We will also develop analog filtering electronics to condition the detector's novel signals and employ digital pulse processing electronics to acquire these signals at rates up to 10/6 cps. Finally, we will devise procedures to test the detector's linearity and develop processing algorithms to perfect this quality. Phase II will conclude with a working and tested prototype. Phase III will entail primarily production engineering efforts. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: As an energy resolved digital detector with 100 microm spatial resolution, the proposed detector technology could find many medical applications, including SPECT, energy resolved angiography for small mammals, bone densitometry on rodent bones, and small, hand-held gamma cameras.

"PHYSIOLOGICAL CONTROLLER FOR ROTARY BLOOD PUMPS   DESCRIPTION (Verbatim From Applicant's Abstract): As the prospects of a              mechanical replacement for a failing human heart are fast becoming a reality,        and patients are indeed returning home to regain a ""normal"" lifestyle, the           limitations of this technology upon quality of life are becoming more apparent.      To address many of these limitations, investigators are developing                   next-generation ventricular assist devices. Based on turbopump technology,           these new devices offer smaller size, greater efficiency (hence smaller              batteries), high reliability, and are more cost effective as compared to their       pulsatile predecessessors. For all the virtues of these new turbopumps, they         bring with additional challenges. Arguably the most urgent is the need for           added intelligence."" These, relatively stupid, devices are highly dependent on       feedback-control to provide physiological response. Unfortunately, developers        have yet to wage a systematic assault on this problem. Preoccupied with              apparently more urgent issues, such as biocompatibility etc., there has been         relatively little attention or resources directed at developing a physiological      controller.                                                                                                                                                               For the past eight years, the P.I. has had an interest in this problem, and has      conducted basic and applied research towards developing control algorithms.

"Shearography for Non-Invasive Dental Health Evaluation   DESCRIPTION: Optical holography has been applied to non-invasive clinical            diagnosis and monitoring of Dental and oral/facial pathology, but has been           sharply limited in its usefulness by its requirements of high laser coherence.       absolute stability of setup. and wet processing of holograms. Physical Optics        Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a shearographic micro-optic camera as a        novel means of non-invasive Dental evaluation and characterization based on          shearing speckle interferometry, miniature camera imaging, and proprietary           neural network image processing. The innovation in this concept is the use of        shearography to avoid the need for high stability, high temporal coherence, and      wet processing. Nearfield shearography will have high spatial resolution, and        the neural network will perform real-time data processing and display.                                                                                                    The unique high resolution. real-time operation. low cost. and miniaturization       will make this device attractive to a large commercial market in Dental and          clinical applications.                                                                                                                                                    In Phase 1. POC will develop a miniature shearographic micro-optic camera            (SMOC) with fiber light delivery. a micro-CCD imaging component. and neural          network. It will be capable of distinguishing among tooth enamel, cementum,           dentine, pulp, and soft tissue.

Because of its high resolution, real-time operation, and immunity to vibration, it will  also have wide applications beyond the medical field, particularly for industrial diagnostics.  High-strength aerospace composite material evaluation and testing as well as weld and pipe  defect inspection are areas where it will be particularly welcome.                                                                                     n/a",Shearography for Non-Invasive Dental Health Evaluation,6404393,R43DE014307,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' dental disorder diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fiber optics', ' image processing', ' interferometry', ' lasers', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' oral health', ' video recording system']",NIDCR,PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION,R43,2001,100000,-0.011012908546311526
"Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System A cancer genetics-tracking database will be redesigned using usability engineering techniques to improve the functionality and usability of the current system. This is important because it will lead to a system that is easier to use and learn, will decrease the chance of errors, and will increase productivity, and user satisfaction. The current state of informatics offers the potential for the creation of tools to assist in the reduction of medical errors. The redesign of this tracking database will be completed through a three-phase process. The first phase will use the results of a usability analysis to redesign and prototype the cancer genetics-tracking database. In the second phase, usability studies will then be conducted to ensure that the system is functional, easy to use, easy to learn, and meets the goals of the users. The usability studies will include heuristic evaluations, keystroke level models, talk-aloud methods, and cognitive walkthrough techniques. The system will be modified based upon the results of these studies. Research will be compiled on the advantages and disadvantages of ICD coding Vs. SNOMED followed by the selection of the most useful system for coding medical information. In the third phase the final redesign will be compared to the old system using a within-subject design to determine if the redesign decreases the error rate, increases productivity, and user satisfaction. This will be followed-up with a survey to determine the perceived usability of the redesigned application. Throughout the redesign process, specific usability guidelines will be developed for designing healthcare software that is computational and knowledge- based in nature.  n/a",Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System,6340157,F38LM007188,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer information system', ' cancer registry /resource', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' family genetics', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,F38,2001,68753,0.0031902438166822003
"Neural Network System for Detection of EEG Microsleeps   DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): A software system based        on Artificial Neuro-fuzzy hybrid technology will be developed for automatic          detection of microsleep events from EEG data. The software system will be            designed for used as a model-free and rule-free classification tool that             achieves generalization power through learning from examples.   The development of the software system will require a Graphical User Interface       for data example selection, frequency-analytic preprocessing of EEG raw data,        feature extraction for microsleep characterization, design and training of           neural networks for single EEG channels, and a fuzzy system for contextual           combination of network response for multiple EEG channels to a single system         response.                                                                                                                       The training and testing of the neural networks will be based on a database of       visually scored examples of microsleep and non-microsleep events from                electrophysiological data, which will be randomly divided into training,             validation and test sets.                                                                                 The performnance of the software system will be evaluated based on the               false-positive and false-negative rate for the microsleep detection using data       examples unknown to the system. The agreement rate between the combined network      response and results from visual and conventional automatic scoring will be          used as additional evaluation parameter.        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The software system will be an attractive tool for researchers, medical and technical  personal, industrial engineers. It enables the user to quantify alertness/sleepiness  in studies on sleep disorders, shiftwork, drug effects and fatigue countermeasures.  It will help reduce time-consuming visual scoring by human experts. In addition, it  will widen our knowledge about the rapid transition events (microsleeps) between  wake and sleep and can contribute to the development of alertness monitor systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      n/a",Neural Network System for Detection of EEG Microsleeps,6338195,R43NS039711,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' electroencephalography', ' electrophysiology', ' human data', ' neural information processing', ' sleep']",NINDS,"CIRCADIAN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2001,93457,-0.022980095026310744
"MAX-ENTROPY CONTROL FOR HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL IMAGING   A low-cost, high-resolution, high-contrast color digital camera optimized        for ophthalmology will be demonstrated. The maximum entropy camera         will be tested for its effectiveness in meeting the image quality requirements       for telemedicine and for remote screening of pre-proliferative and                   proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The proposed device exploits recent              technological advances in high sensitivity CCD cameras and digital signal            processing electronics. Today's low cost 8-bit CCD cameras do not have the           dynamic range to image the human retina, which is characterized by regions of        high reflectivity (20-40 percent), such as the optic disc, and very low              reflectivity (<2 percent), such as the macula and fovea. Existing digital            cameras used in ophthalmology are not designed to deal with the high dynamic         range and do not consider the special re-saturated characteristics of the            retina. The proposed device will be shown to offer significant improvement over      existing digital color cameras by addressing each of the deficiencies                mentioned.

"COMMUNICATION AID UTILIZING WORD LEVEL DISAMBIGUATION There are approximately 2.5 million people in the US who are speech impaired to the extent that it is considered a functional limitation.  Today, many people with severe communication disabilities lack access to electronic and even printed material, have a lack of opportunity for interaction and opportunity for self-advocacy, and experience isolation.  Providing accessibility to wireless voice, data and Internet communications directly from the device is of tremendous importance to people with severe communication disabilities. The primary objective under the Phase I grant was to investigate the potential of word-level disambiguation technology for text generation on a communication aid to meet the needs of many individuals requiring augmentative and alternative communication (AAC).  Phase I findings validated T9 technology as a viable method for text generation and also AAC device users want to access wireless voice, data and Internet communications directly from the device.  The specific aims of Phase II are to: investigate hardware platforms for AAC device host candidates, develop Windows software modules for T9 and AAC, develop portable AAC resources, integrate wireless voice and data communications, and conduct usability testing of the product as it develops. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION The outcome of Phase II will be a communication aid device for production in Phase III that is based on commercially available hardware with minimal custom AAC hardware support.  The goal is that the software platform developed in Phase II will be ported to existing low-cost hardware as much as possible to: make use of newly developed platforms, provide more choice to AAC device users, provide more flexibility in user interface, and reduce overall device costs to the end user when commercially manufactured.  n/a",COMMUNICATION AID UTILIZING WORD LEVEL DISAMBIGUATION,6188611,R44RR013191,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical biomedical equipment', ' clinical research', ' communication disorder aid', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' computer system hardware', ' human subject', ' online computer', ' vocabulary', ' voice']",NCRR,"MADENTEC (USA), INC.",R44,2001,316991,0.0450391126645315
"A Personal Status Monitor for the Home The purpose of this Phase II SBIR is to develop a portable and completely wireless system that detects, processes, and analyzes muscle activity for remotely monitoring the functional status of an individual. The Personal Status Monitor (PSM) will remotely monitor the use of muscles during the exertion of motor tasks in a continuous and unobstructed fashion. Through pattern recognition of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals, the PSM will provide the caregiver with an objective parametric measure of how physically active their patient has been, such as walling, sitting, personal care, and feeding. The PSM will consist of three components: 1) four wireless EMG sensors, 2) a body worn transceiver (Repeater), and 3) the Base Station, which processes the signals for pattern recognition and feature extraction. The information can be sent to a remote location via telephone lines or the Internet. The specific aims of this program for Phase II are: Aim 1: To continue with Phase I development of the pattern recognition algorithms in patients with stroke; Aim 2: Design and build a working prototype of the hardware and software for the PSM; and Aim 3: Field test the prototype wireless system among stroke patients in the home environment. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The MA will primarily augment clinical service by making the line an effective place for rehabilitation. In addition, the PSM will have direct applicability to the field of ergonomics for work-site assessment, or in sports or recreational activities as a feedback device to facilitate training of skilled movements. Numerous other applications in the field of rehabilitation could include monitoring of drug therapies for tremor or other neuromuscular conditions, or home-exercise compliance.

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6383999,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2001,200999,-0.0025546218025277686
"NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Atrial arrhythmias are extremely common and are often associated with            significant morbidity and mortality. The ability to develop and                  prescribe new treatments for atrial arrhythmias depends on the                   availability of better diagnostic tools that are simple, inexpensive,            and effective enough to support their use for screening large numbers            of patients.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6467733,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2001,607570,0.03000274041464299
"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system.

"ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC LOGIC FOR PSYCHIATRY   DESCRIPTION: (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): This Phase I project          proposes to assess the feasibility of an advanced diagnostic logic system            (Diagnostica) to support the clinical assessment process for diagnosis in            psychiatry. A working prototype of the diagnostic rules in the American              Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) uses and          artificial intelligence engine (""XSB"") to implement the logic of DSM-IV along        with and an interactive graphical user interface to allow a user to add              information and understand conclusions reached by the system. The Phase I            programming objectives are to make Diagnostica ready for commercial use by           improving its graphical user interface, and finalizing implementation of its         logical rules. The resulting system will be a practical tool in clinical             settings, and relies on computer science innovations that have preciously            neither been explored nor applied in the domain of medical reasoning. With the       emergence of decision support systems, the need for better quality diagnostic        information is becoming increasingly apparent. This has been due, in part, to        the complexity of diagnostic processes and the emphasis on support of financial      processes. Within mental health, the DSM-IV provides both a model and a              standard for making diagnoses. A software component that provides flexible,          complete, and efficient application of this standard is of great value. The          innovation of Diagnostica relies on the sophistication of its modeling of            DSM-IV rules, and it's flexibility in applying those rules. Diagnostica will         automatically track the status of the information entered and allow users to         tie up 'loose ends' in documenting the proof of diagnoses formally. AS example,      the user may indicate that a set of diagnoses in 'believed true' without             specifying the symptoms needed to make the diagnoses formally ( a procedure          used routinely in clinical practice). the application will track whatever            'residual' data this is necessary in order to complete formal diagnoses, while       leaving the option of when, or if, to complete the process up to the user.                                                                                                Phase II objectives include: (1) extending Diagnostica to provide other              software applications needing diagnostic decision support services, and              specifically to link Diagnostica to the World Health Organization Schedules for      Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN); (2) addressing logical modeling       of time and creating an effective user interface for repeated assessment; (3)        incorporating probabilistic information about sets of symptoms based on              empirical information initially obtained in Phase I; and (4) developing and          testing ""belief revision"" functions to changes in knowledge stemming from            repeated clinical assessment.

"IMPROVED COLLIMATION FOR PIXELATED RADIATION DETECTORS   DESCRIPTION: The investigators propose to test the feasibility of developing         improved collimators for use with higher performance pixelated detectors under       development for use in gamma cameras now under development, as further               described by their abstract:                                                                                                                                              ""In nuclear medicine, the collimator plays a critical role in the formation of       a projection image of the radiopharmaceutical distribution within a patient.         The current state-of-the-art of collimator design for Nuclear Medicine has           matured, under the assumption that gamma-ray detectors have an intrinsic             position dependant Gaussian response function. A fundamental rethinking of           collimator design is necessary to optimize collimation for solid state               detectors that have a fixed intrinsic rect function response. We will construct      design tools by first developing a mathematical model of collimation for             detectors with intrinsic pixels and then implement it by computer algorithms.        We will conduct experiments to measure performance and validate the simulation       tools. Using the validated simulator we will then explore novel collimator           designs and hole patterns. We will examine all proposed designs for                  sensitivity, resolution, cost and manufacture. To advance clinical                   applications, collimator design will need to keep pace with the anticipated          improvements in detector technology.

"ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR Imaging detectors for 10 to 150 keV photons have many uses in medical technology, including tumor imaging, SPECT, and radiography. Digital output is particularly useful since it allows image enhancement, analysis, transmission and storage. In Phase I we proposed a new technology that could capture images with 100 microm spatial resolution and 1 keV energy resolution or better. This capability would facilitate entirely new classes of medical diagnostic procedures, particularly for transgenic small animal imaging. Our Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In this Phase II effort, collaborating with Paul Luke at LBNL, we will construct 1 cm thick crossed-strip HPGe detectors having 10 x 10 strips, each 2 mm x 20 mm. We will develop cooled FET preamplifiers having low noise and large bandwidth properties specifically required by this approach. We will also develop analog filtering electronics to condition the detector's novel signals and employ digital pulse processing electronics to acquire these signals at rates up to 10/6 cps. Finally, we will devise procedures to test the detector's linearity and develop processing algorithms to perfect this quality. Phase II will conclude with a working and tested prototype. Phase III will entail primarily production engineering efforts. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: As an energy resolved digital detector with 100 microm spatial resolution, the proposed detector technology could find many medical applications, including SPECT, energy resolved angiography for small mammals, bone densitometry on rodent bones, and small, hand-held gamma cameras. Non-medical applications would include non-destructive testing, astrophysical gamma imaging, nuclear cleanup uses, and x-ray diffraction detectors.  n/a",ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR,6211037,R44CA075844,"['X ray', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' cadmium', ' clinical biomedical equipment', ' digital imaging', ' gamma radiation', ' tellurium', ' zinc']",NCI,X-RAY INSTRUMENTATION ASSOCIATES,R44,2000,416478,0.00693493441393803
"CLUSTERING AND HYPER-LINKING OF LONG-TERM EEGS The proposed work offers enhancements to the MagicMarker software developed in Phase I.  This software offers a new methodology for the display and analysis of long-term EEG records.  Epochs of similar activity are grouped into segments and then states via two-pass hierarchial clustering.  This results in clearly differentiated background, paroxysmal activity and patient state transitions.  The underlying EEG  is always available via hyper- links so that artifacts can be distinguished from ""real EEG."" The Phase II work adds classification abilities (intelligence) to the Phase I software.  Proposed are an expert-level seizure detector, an ICU abnormality detector and a user-defined activity detector.  The effort includes the development of a large library of carefully analyzed and annotated prolonged EEG studies. Newborns, older children and adults will be included ensuring robust algorithms for all age groups. The proposed software greatly reduces staff requirements for long-term monitoring through intelligent notification (visual, audible and dial-up pager) of interesting events.  This, in addition to the ability to monitor patients ""away from the lab,"" provides more frequent patient checks and improved clinical outcomes. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION The proposed software would be a valuable addition to any digital EEG because of the great timesavings it provides for both neurologists and EEG technicians.

"WAVELET-BASED AUTOMATED CHROMOSOME IDENTIFICATION Commercial automated karyotyping instruments have improved to the point where the major factor limiting throughput is the time required for operator correction of chromosome classification errors. An improvement in chromosome classification accuracy would significantly increase the value of these instruments in cytogenetics labs. The goal of this project is to develop and commercialize significantly improved chromosome measurement and classification techniques for automated karyotyping. Currently the best-performing chromosome classification approach uses Weighted Density Distribution (WDD) features [11] to quantify the banding pattern of the chromosomes. These are computed as inner products between the banding profile and a set of WDD basis functions. The particular set of 1unctions originally proposed by Granum [11,38] has come into widespread use. In Phase I we showed that better function sets exist and that our new approach can find better WDD features than the best currently used. We have an innovative wavelet-based method for generating WDD functions and a chromosome classification testbed which supports large scale classification experiments. We propose to conduct a thorough, methodical search for better performing basis functions in Phase II. Phase III will incorporate the technology into PSI's PowerGene automated karyotyping instruments.

"MICRO-OPTICS-BASED DIGITAL ALLERGEN COUNTER The current pollen identification and counting method based on microscopic visual examination is very time consuming and labor intensive. More importantly, it is very ""subjective"" and not truly scientific. Intelligent Optical Systems, Inc. proposes to develop a portable digital allergen counter (DAC) to accurately and reliably count and identify airborne pollen grains and fungal spores. The proposed DAC combines a micro-image scanner, a high-speed video chip, an allergen morphology data bank, and a built-in image processor into an integrated and automated pollen counter. The DAC will rapidly identify and quantify pollen, grains and spores. By making it much easier to collect allergen information in multiple locations, the proposed device will reduce morbidity by providing improved warnings on days with high pollen counts. The specific aims of the Phase I project are to design and construct optical image scanner suitable for allergen detection, identify the morphology of several types of pollen, grains, and spores, integrate the DAC system and test and evaluate the system feasibility. In Phase II, an engineering prototype of a portable instrument will be built and field-validated with real-world samples. We will also expand its capability to increase the pollen types of interest. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: A compact, simple, and easy-to-use digital allergen counting system that can monitor indoor or outdoor air quality that will minimize people's overexposure to allergens.

"DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED IMAGE REPORTING SYSTEM We have constructed a prototype structured reporting system that replaces conventional dictation and transcription for medical image reporting. Key design features include reporting speed, generation of graphical reports, structured storage of imaging findings, and the use of existing lexicons. Pilot timing data suggest that a radiologist using our system can generate a report more rapidly than with conventional reporting methods or speech recognition systems. Support is sought to refine the prototype, and to conduct feasibility testing. The specific aims are (1) to augment and refine a hierarchical test lexicon of imaging terms (2) to develop methods for the representation and reporting of imaging findings and their logical relationships, (3) to evaluate the system's performance on clinical imaging reports, and (4) to assess the completeness of existing lexicons for imaging. The project is supported by a Technical Advisory Committee comprised of experts in key methodological areas. A successful Phase I will lead (in Phase II) to testing of the approach for cross-sectional imaging, to adoption, augmentation, and use of an existing lexicon, to construction of real-time decision support techniques based on the knowledge base of imaging findings generated by the system, and to system evaluation in a clinical setting. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Our structured reporting system is appealing to radiologists because it speeds up the reporting process compared to conventional dictation/transcription or speech recognition. In addition, the system eliminates the costs, delays, inaccuracies, and other organizational problems associated with transcription services, thereby improving patient care.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine.

"INTERACTIVE MEDIA FOR WOMEN CONSIDERING HORMONE THERAPY The long-term goal of Phase I and Phase II is to create a series of bilingual (Spanish/English), bicultural, interactive CD-ROMs dealing with issues related to menopause and aging, with specific emphasis on Hispanic women. This proposal will result in a CD-ROM about Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) that takes 15-3O minutes to use and will test its value in a controlled study. Through an interactive decision-tree that specifies individual risk factors and lifestyle preferences, the CD-ROM will help users identify their options, including HRT, lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet, and other alternatives. Besides providing information, the CD-ROM will be designed to improve decision-making and increase women's confidence in their ability to make informed choices. Although it may increase the risk of cancer, HRT relieves short-term menopausal symptoms, and appears to offer long-term benefits of reduced risk for heart disease, stroke and osteoporosis. Over 40 million women will pass through menopause in the next two decades. Studies have shown that Hispanic women are less familiar with HRT and less likely to use it than non-Hispanic white women. In addition, Hispanas approach medical care with their own set of cultural values. Interactive media offer personalization, enhanced learning through multiple sensory input, and a cost-effective method of providing information in a managed care environment or busy individual practice. This is an innovative application of existing technology to provide patient education. Possible topics for Phase II include osteoporosis, heart disease, depression, and stroke.

"SBIR Phase I - Topic 402 -  Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Retinoblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer affecting the retina, optic nerve, and brain. Accounting for 6% of all cancers in children under the age of five, it is the world's most common primary intraocular childhood malignancy. While survival rates in the U.S. are high, early detection is pivotal to preserving vision: by the time symptoms present, enucleation is often the only option.

"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10140938,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Boston', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Information Systems', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Patients&apos', ' Rooms', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Sum', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vendor', 'Ventilator', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'design', 'encryption', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'point of care', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2020,210642,-0.01550013652452749
"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control ABSTRACT Approximately 41,000 individuals live with upper-limb loss (loss of at least one hand) in the US. Fortunately, prosthetic devices have advanced considerably in the past decades with the development of dexterous, anthropomorphic hands. However, potentially the most promising used control strategy, myoelectric control, lacks a correspondingly high-level of performance and hence the use of dexterous hands remains highly limited. The need for a complete overhaul in upper limb prosthesis control is well highlighted by the abandonment rates of myoelectric devices, which can reach up to 40% in the case of trans-humeral amputees. The area of research that has received the most focus over the past decade has been “pattern recognition,” which is a signal processing based control method that uses multi-channel surface electromyography as the control input. While pattern recognition provides intuitive operation of multiple prosthetic degrees of freedom, it lacks robustness and requires frequent, often daily calibration. Thus, it has not yet achieved the desired clinical acceptance. Our team proposes clinical translation of a novel highly adaptive upper limb prosthesis control system that incorporates two major advances: 1) machine learning (robust classification by implementing a non-boundary based algorithm), and 2) training by retrospectively incorporating user data from activities of daily living (ADL). The proposed system will enable machine intelligence with user input for prosthesis control. Our work is organized as follows: Phase I: (a) First, we will implement a fundamentally new machine intelligence technique, Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Sparse Representation Classification (EASRC), that is more resilient to untrained noisy conditions that users may encounter in the real-world and requires less data than traditional myoelectric signal processing. (b) In parallel, we will implement an adaptive learning algorithm, Nessa, which allows users to relabel misclassified data recorded during use and then update the EASRC classifier to adapt to any major extrinsic or intrinsic changes in the signals. Taken together, EASRC and Nessa comprise the Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system. Once, the RESCU implementation is complete, we will optimize the system through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University, and complete an iterative benchtop RESCU evaluation with a focus group of 3 amputee subjects and their prosthetists. Phase II: Verification and validation of RESCU will be completed, culminating in third-party validation testing and certification. Finally, we will complete a clinical assessment including self-reporting subjective measures, and real-world usage metrics in a long-term clinical study. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project, we aim to empower the user by bringing them into the control loop of their prosthesis and improve the stability of their control strategy over time. Specifically, we implement to a robust classifier, an adaptive learning algorithm, and a smartwatch interface, which allows the user to teach their device when it misunderstands the commands that the user is sending to control the prosthesis. This will result in improved control without cumbersome or time-consuming effort on the part of the user and, more importantly, we hope that it will give the user a greater sense of empowerment and ownership over their prosthesis.",User-driven Retrospectively Supervised Classification Updating (RESCU) system for robust upper limb prosthesis control,10078697,U44NS108894,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Calibration', 'Certification', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prosthesis', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Upper Extremity', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'empowerment', 'functional improvement', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning algorithm', 'myoelectric control', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prosthesis control', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,"INFINITE BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",U44,2020,64079,0.0011930354439059247
"Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things Project Summary The objective of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Heart failure (HF) has become a challenge of epidemic proportions to the healthcare system in the United States with poor prognosis for patients and elevated healthcare costs. LVADs are standard surgical therapy for advanced HF patients refractory to medical management. Despite extensive training and daily care, LVAD recipients still experience driveline infections (14-28%) at an annual cost of $20,000 and represents a clinically- significant adverse event and one of the primary causes of death. Transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) are being developed to eliminate the LVAD’s driveline. Currently, TETS technology is limited by (1) low energy transfer efficiency, (2) power loss due to coil misalignment, (3) reduced data transmission rates with increasing depth of penetration, and (4) heating of tissue. Bionet Sonar’s software-defined ultrasonic wide band (UsWB) proprietary technology is capable of transmitting energy and data via ultrasonic waves through tissue, bone, and fluids at penetration depths significantly greater than RF waves and with greater reliability. Since increasing energy efficiency results in reduced energy storage requirements UsWB also enables reduction in size of implantable technologies. Bionet’s UsWB TETS (UTET) system includes: (1) energy transfer portal with internal and external intelligent piezo array-surfaces, (2) implantable controller with energy storage capacity, (3) external controller with IoMT portal, and (4) wearable power supply. These elements will enable wireless LVAD operation over wide range of clinical conditions with real-time data acquisition and diagnostics. Proof-of-concept for Bionet’s core technology was tested in vitro, demonstrating superior data transmission compared to RF (700kHz, 180kbit/s, 20cm tissue depth) and ultrasonic wireless recharging. In this Phase I study, feasibility of the fully-integrated wireless, UTET system for LVAD support will be demonstrated by completing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Design and fabricate fully-integrated UTET system and demonstrate feasibility with clinical- grade LVAD in an in vitro model that mimics clinically-relevant implantable tissue depths and geometries. Specific Aim 2: Demonstrate feasibility of the fully-integrated UTET system with clinical-grade LVAD in an acute bovine model (n=2) at flow rates of 1-5 L/min for up to 8 hours. This proposal leverages the strengths of Bionet and the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute. Our long-term goal is to successfully translate the Bionet’s UTET system into clinical practice. The core platform technology may also be applied to other networked systems for the treatment of diverse etiologies opening a new frontier in multimodal patient treatment and use of Artificial Intelligence for patient care. Project Narrative Through this proposal a novel platform technology using ultrasonic waves for wireless powering and bidirectional real-time communication of a ventricular assist device will be developed. Ultrasound wideband technology will be used to create a system that doesn’t require a trans-cutaneous driveline to control and energize the pump of a ventricular assist device, thus, eliminating drive-line infections and improving quality of life of heart failure patients. This technology will not only improve patient outcomes and healthcare economics of this patient population, but may also enable other innovative therapies in other populations.",Wireless ultrasonic powering and monitoring of Left Ventricular Assist Devices through the Internet of Medical Things,10007683,R43HL152767,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Bluetooth', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cattle', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Energy Transfer', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Heating', 'Hour', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Power Sources', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Wireless Technology', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'frontier', 'health care economics', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vitro testing', 'innovation', 'left ventricular assist device', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'pre-clinical', 'pressure', 'product development', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'software development', 'sonar', 'subcutaneous', 'transmission process', 'ventricular assist device', 'verification and validation', 'wireless communication']",NHLBI,BIONET SONAR,R43,2020,468992,-0.0027161661221579993
"A Novel Cryopreservation Technology for Large Skin Grafts to Facilitate Tissue Banking and Allograft Transplantations SUMMARY As a result of recent and rapid advances of immunogenetical, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies, the accuracy and efficiency of donor-recipient immunogenetical matching are expected to be significantly improved. As such, traditional tissue banking practices are being severely challenged due to low cryopreservation throughput. Skin allograft transplantations are currently utilized for numerous clinical applications. In such applications, donor tissues are now typically utilized as “expensive bandages”, i.e. for temporary coverage, thereby requiring painful and damaging follow-on autotransplantation procedures. With tremendously improved skin graft cryopreservation methods coupled with use of HLA matching based on AI network, future tissue banking platforms can potentially provide grafts to be used as permanent and definitive treatment for patients, thereby bringing high impact to clinical applications and the healthcare industry. Based on CryoCrate’s novel ultra-fast (106 K/min on a sample surface) cooling technology platform (PCT/US2019/26162), this project aims to develop a highly efficient (approaching 100% post-thaw viability) tissue graft cryopreservation prototype system that requires no cryoprotectant. The post-thaw viability and functionality will be assessed by standard in vitro assays using porcine and human skin (research exempt) grafts and in vivo assays using a mouse model. After achieving these aims, in future phase II and III stages, CryoCrate and its academic collaborator will collaborate with a local Organ Procurement Organization (Mid-America Transplant) and a wound healing clinic (University of Missouri Hospital) for porcine and human skin transplantation studies and clinical trials. Narrative A novel skin graft cryopreservation technology that requires no cryoprotectant will be developed to significantly improve efficiencies for tissue banking and allograft transplantation practices. This project initiates collaboration between CryoCrate LLC and local stakeholders, and thereby paves a path to commercialization of a new generation of ultra‐fast tissue cryopreservation devices.",A Novel Cryopreservation Technology for Large Skin Grafts to Facilitate Tissue Banking and Allograft Transplantations,10011745,R43AI155070,"['Allografting', 'Americas', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autologous Transplantation', 'Bandage', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cryopreserved Tissue', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Freeze Drying', 'Freezing', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunogenetics', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'In Vitro', 'Liquid substance', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Organ Procurements', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Skin graft', 'Stains', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical application', 'commercialization', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'scale up', 'skin allograft', 'success', 'transplant model', 'two-dimensional', 'wound healing']",NIAID,"CRYOCRATE, LLC",R43,2020,160371,-0.011564431793617776
"Healthcare Impact of Consumer-Driven Atrial Fibrillation Detection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Companies are increasingly marketing mobile technologies as FDA-cleared medical devices, yet we do not know the consequences of these devices on healthcare utilization, cost, and outcomes. Recently, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4 as an FDA-cleared medical device. The device includes an alert for the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and allows anyone to monitor their heart rhythm for the presence of AF. Apple has an enormous global audience, and the number of people who will use this (and other similar devices) to self-diagnose or monitor AF will be substantial. On one hand, the device may allow new diagnoses that result in treatment, improved quality of life, fewer AF related complications. On the other hand, the device may result in false positives in otherwise healthy people, resulting in more testing and treatments with associated harms. In fact, the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommends against routine surveillance for AF in the general population, citing lack of evidence and possible harm. We have an urgent need for a population-based infrastructure to ensure that technologies entering the market as medical devices are beneficial and safe.  The overall goal of this project is to measure the uptake and effect of the Apple Watch 4 release on healthcare utilization among first-time and known AF patients. Dr. Shah is an early stage investigator with a K08 Career Development Award from the NHLBI. As part of the K08, she has developed a detailed cohort of contemporary AF patients, including clinical notes. Along with a team, she will use real world data, as proposed by the FDA, to generate evidence about risks and benefits of consumer-driven AF detection. She will use natural language processing to leverage the notes and identify AF patients who seek care due to the medical device, and evaluate downstream healthcare utilization, such as additional clinic visits, cardioversions, additional remote monitoring, and cost. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aims: 1) Estimate the proportion of first-time AF patient visits attributable to a mobile device before and after FDA clearance of the Apple Watch 4, and characterize device accuracy and downstream healthcare utilization in this population; and 2) Evaluate healthcare utilization patterns among prevalent AF patients who use mobile devices with AF alerts.  In 2017, Apple sold 17.7 million smart watches, in a device market that continues to grow. Extrapolating from prior annual sales and conservatively assuming a 5% increase in users each year, almost 60 million people will have an Apple Watch by the end of 2020 (not accounting for non-Apple devices with similar functionality). Thus, even in this short period of time, uptake will be substantial and warrant immediate feedback. The results of this project will provide preliminary data for a long-term, multicenter study that evaluates the benefits (improved quality of life, fewer strokes) and harms (increased treatment complications, increased cost) of consumer-driven AF detection. PROJECT NARRATIVE The consequence of mobile technologies marketed as medical devices are unknown, including devices that provide alerts for the presence of atrial fibrillation.

"Development of a Wheelchair Maintenance Alert Application for Elderly Wheelchair Users Project Summary Elderly wheelchair users experience wheelchair breakdowns every 2-3 months in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and rural areas of high-income countries. One in three breakdowns leads to adverse physical, social, psychosocial and economic consequences to wheelchair users which increases the public health and personal burden. Preventative wheelchair maintenance has been found to reduce the frequency of wheelchair breakdowns by ten-fold, but compliance with maintenance recommendations is extremely low because they are generic and not reflective of how and where the wheelchair is being used. To address this issue, we are developing a low-cost, scalable maintenance application that leverages artificial intelligence tools to provide maintenance recommendations tailored to how a wheelchair is used. The availability of low-cost technology and widespread use of smartphones by the elderly and people with disabilities in LMICs has led us to develop a smartphone application called WheelTrak that measures wheelchair wear as a function of usage in community. Based on the wear factors, the application produces a Wheelchair Wear Index (WWI) that is representative of wear of critical wheelchair parts that are prone to breakdown. Once a WWI threshold is reached, maintenance is required, and the application notifies the user and/or caregiver who can conduct maintenance to avoid breakdowns and related health consequences. We will conduct a data collection study in collaboration with our wheelchair industry partner – UCP Wheels in El Salvador – and characterize the WWI for the elderly by tracking wear factors which include user’s travel distance, ground shocks and surface vibrations using WheelTrak and a wheel sensor. Based on the trained WWI algorithm, a preventative maintenance schedule will be developed for older adults that can be employed through WheelTrak for maintenance reminders. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to evaluate the usability of the application and gather barriers to maintenance. User feedback will assist us in improving WheelTrak for greater user satisfaction and compliance with maintenance, and addressing any personal or logistical challenges that elderly users and their caregivers or family members may face with conducting maintenance activities in LMICs. Findings from the proposed studies in this application will assist us in planning future studies to investigate the WWI-enabled WheelTrak tool as an intervention to prevent or reduce breakdowns and health consequences with the elderly in LMICs. Preventative maintenance of wheelchairs is necessary to reduce frequent wheelchair breakdowns and corresponding health consequences experienced by the elderly in adverse environments which are commonly present in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). WheelTrak is a smartphone application that measures real-time wheelchair wear in the community during use and triggers preventative maintenance reminders. In this study, we are modelling the application algorithm and collecting user and caregiver feedback to transform WheelTrak into a maintenance intervention tool for elderly wheelchair users in LMICs.",Development of a Wheelchair Maintenance Alert Application for Elderly Wheelchair Users,10095020,R03AG069836,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Economics', 'El Salvador', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Income', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care', 'Maintenance', 'Manual wheelchair', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Notification', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'User Compliance', 'Wheelchairs', 'aged', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'industry partner', 'low and middle-income countries', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'rural area', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'vibration']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2020,75877,-0.019580957754395376
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,10241562,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2020,2500,0.01122768962722258
"BlueBox: A Complete Code Blue Data Recorder, Phase II “Code blue” is the signal used in hospitals to call for an immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following a cardiac or respiratory arrest. Reviewing the performance of the “code blue team” is a cornerstone for improving outcomes. The current standard of using handwritten records on a paper “code sheet” does not allow measurement of key quality indicators and is subject to human error. In the Phase I STTR project, we developed an electronic device for complete recording of code blue events, called BlueBox. The BlueBox is a small electronic recorder on an adhesive patch to be placed on the left chest next to the mid-sternum. The prototype we developed in Phase I was successfully tested on high fidelity mannequins and on pigs. In Phase II, our goal is to complete the product development and testing and prepare the BlueBox for regulatory clearance and market launch. To achieve this goal, we propose 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to complete the product development of the BlueBox device and the software user interface (UI) for the “electronic code sheet.” We will turn the engineering prototype we developed in Phase I into a product ready for commercialization through rigorous product development processes. We will develop a mobile app for iPads with a software UI for the “electronic code sheet.” Aim 2 is to conduct human factors and usability engineering (HF/UE) testing and prepare for regulatory submission. The alpha prototype will undergo HF/UE testing in the Simulation Center. We will establish and maintain quality management records and conduct a pilot production run of 200 units of BlueBox. Aim 3 is to validate the BlueBox system in clinical studies. The objectives of the clinical study are: 1) to establish equivalence of the electronic code sheet to the current standard of paper code sheet; 2) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electronic code sheet in identifying key CPR quality indicators. We will conduct a code blue simulation study of 50 sessions on high fidelity mannequins with hospital code blue teams to compare BlueBox recording with paper code sheets. We will conduct a study of 30 healthy volunteers for BlueBox sensor validation. The criteria for successful development of the product will be that it passes all required regulatory testing and is validated in the clinical study for its equivalence and effectiveness in code blue recording. There will be two major milestones in this project: (1) finalizing product development with successful test production of 200 units; and (2) completing the clinical study and preparing for a 510(k) submission. Achieving the aims will result in a validated BlueBox system ready for submission to the FDA and commercialization. We intend to first introduce the BlueBox system to hospitals as a tool for staff training and quality improvement. We will continue the technology development with machine learning to provide instant feedback in the second generation BlueBox. Our ultimate goal is to minimize human error and improve patient outcomes through the BlueBox system’s better documentation and continuous feedback mechanism. Modified Specific Aims  “Code blue” is the alert used in hospitals to initiate immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following a cardiac or respiratory arrest.1 These situations are dire emergencies. Medical errors are likely to occur, and lives can be lost. Reviewing the performance quality of the “code blue team” is a cornerstone for improving outcomes of in-hospital arrests.2-4 Thorough and accurate recording of code blue events facilitates the detailed analyses needed for quality improvement.5-7 However, the current standard of using handwritten records on a paper “code sheet” does not allow measurement of key quality indicators and is subject to human errors. In our Phase I STTR project, we developed an electronic device for complete recording of code blue events, called BlueBox. The BlueBox is a small electronic recorder on an adhesive patch to be placed on the left chest next to the mid-sternum. It captures and records all code blue events -- vital signs, cardiac rhythm, verbal orders and their execution, chest compressions, cardioversion/defibrillation, procedures, medications, and labs. The prototype we developed in Phase I was successfully tested on high fidelity mannequins in the Simulation Center, and on pigs in the Animal Lab. The purpose of the BlueBox is to support medical training and quality improvement in code blue situations, and to enhance safety for patients undergoing CPR. In Phase II, our goal is to complete the product development and testing to prepare the BlueBox for regulatory clearance and market launch. To achieve this goal, we propose 3 Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Completing the product development of the BlueBox recorder and the software user interface (UI) for the “electronic code sheet” In Phase I, after developing the BlueBox technology and completing its proof-of-concept, the engineering prototype was tested successfully. The firmware drives all sensors and enables simultaneous recordings of all parameters with time stamps. The circuit can withstand 5kV, which is what is used in cardioversion and defibrillation. In Phase II, we will turn the prototype into a product ready for commercialization through rigorous product development processes. The product development processes include: miniaturization, mechanical design, industrial design, and usability engineering, as well as development of a mobile app for an iPad with an “electronic code sheet” user interface (UI) displaying the code blue events. To provide instant feedback during CPR, we will develop model-based and machine learning data analytics during and beyond the Phase II project. Specific Aim 2. Conducting human factors and usability testing, quality management and regulatory support and preparation We will conduct human factors and usability engineering (HF/UE) testing on the alpha prototype in the Simulation Center. The first HF/UE study aims to test the use of the BlueBox recorder by members and captains of the hospital code team in a code blue scenario. The second HF/UE study aims to test the software and UI of the electronic code sheet on iPads, as used by members of the hospital code blue team, hospital administrators, and EMR and IT specialists. We will establish and maintain quality management records and conduct a pilot production run of 200 units of BlueBox. The pilot run units will be tested for reliability and validity in the Simulation Center. We will request a pre-submission meeting (Qsub) with the FDA. In the Qsub meeting, we will discuss specific regulatory submission requirements and obtain feedback on the clinical validation study. Specific Aim 3. Validating the BlueBox system in clinical studies We will first conduct a prospective study of 50 sessions of simulated code blue resuscitations. Each session will be attended by a team of 4 clinicians-- a captain (physician), a nurse, an ancillary staff, and a code sheet recording staff (typically a nurse). We will also conduct a study of BlueBox sensor validation in 30 healthy volunteers. We will conduct a code blue simulation study on high fidelity mannequins with a hospital code blue team to compare BlueBox recording with paper code sheets. The objectives of the clinical studies are: 1) to establish equivalence of the electronic code sheet to the current standard of paper code sheet; 2) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electronic code sheet in identifying key CPR quality indicators specified in the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. Feasibility Criteria: The criteria for successful development of the BlueBox are:1) it passes all required regulatory testing; 2) it is validated in the clinical study for its equivalence and effectiveness in code blue recording and quality review and improvement. Expected Outcomes and Impact: Two major milestones are (1) finalizing product development in Year 1, and (2) completing the clinical study in Year 2. Achieving the aims will result in a validated BlueBox system ready for regulatory submission to the FDA and commercialization. We intend to first market the BlueBox system to hospitals as a tool for staff training and quality improvement. We will continue the development of BlueBox technology with machine learning algorithms to provide instant feedback. Our ultimate goal is to minimize human error and improve patient outcomes through the BlueBox system’s continuous feedback mechanism. Debriefings and detailed reviews of the performance of the “code blue team” in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can improve quality of care and patient outcomes. In Phase I, we developed and successfully tested an electronic device, the BlueBox, for recording all CPR events and enabling full displays of code blue resuscitations in an “electronic code sheet.” We will turn the engineering prototype into a product ready for regulatory submission and commercialization in the proposed Phase II project.","BlueBox: A Complete Code Blue Data Recorder, Phase II",9857035,R42GM113463,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adhesives', 'American Heart Association', 'Animals', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Code Blue', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Countershock', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Situation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Administrators', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Industrialization', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality Indicator', 'Quality of Care', 'Records', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sternum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validity and Reliability', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'commercialization', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'heart rhythm', 'human error', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile application', 'patient safety', 'product development', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'technology development', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"NEOVATIVE, INC.",R42,2020,821493,0.019474497417017303
"Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years, and rotator cuff repair is a standard surgical procedure with nearly 500,000 procedures performed annually. In the United States alone the direct costs are over $7 billion per year. There is a relatively high rate of retears: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a protracted process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloaded by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. There is an inherent conflict in immobilizing the shoulder to protect the repair and mobilizing the shoulder to prevent stiffness. Teaching the patient passive exercises that do not activate contraction of the supraspinatus muscle is challenging and very difficult to monitor. To address this unmet need, we have developed a wearable sensor that provides direct real-time continuous biofeedback of muscle activity, joint angle, skin temperature, and swelling to enable passive shoulder exercises while minimizing muscle contraction. To test and validate this device we propose to the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Design, manufacture, and test a wearable device with surface EMG (sEMG), inertial measurement unit (IMU), temperature, and bioimpedance sensors. Aim 2: Measure accuracy of Active4D sEMG and IMUs relative to standard clinical measurements. Active4D is a surgeon-driven company devoted to enhancing patient recovery from surgery by leveraging new technology. Active4D’s unique wearable sensor provides continuous long-term sensor augmented biofeedback to patients and enables remote patient monitoring for surgeons. The device measures seven physiologic metrics in real time – muscle activation, joint range of motion, skin temperature, swelling, activity, gait, and fall risk. Real time physiologic data will increase safety, improve outcomes, and enhance patient experience while lowering the cost of rehabilitation and complications. Unique artificial intelligence driven algorithms can decrease complications through predictive analytics which enable early detection and intervention for high risk patients.  The specific innovation to the application of rotator cuff repair, is the instantaneous feedback of muscle activity and motion which can accelerate recovery while reducing the risk of retears. At the successful completion of Phase I, we plan to launch a clinical trial comparing the outcomes of rotator cuff repair in patients guided by the A4D device in comparison to the current standard of postoperative rehabilitation.  Active4D is a small business with the objective of developing smart wearables, which integrate multiple biological and environmental sensors, wireless communication, computer models, and data analysis for providing feedback and remote monitoring, to enhance surgical rehabilitation and improved patient outcomes in orthopaedics. Co-founders Drs. Hoenecke and D’Lima have extensive experience in shoulder surgery and rehabilitation, multi-center clinical trials, and biomechanics research; and have successfully executed challenging projects such as implantation of innovative electronic knee designs and development of new shoulder implants. Dr. Hoenecke has over 30 years of experience in the practice of sports medicine with an emphasis on shoulder repair and reconstruction. He provides care for elite athletes and is design surgeon for two shoulder implants. Active4D has partnered with expert physical therapists and orthopedists to develop and test our innovative technology. Rotator cuff tears are a common condition affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years. Despite the popularity of surgical repair, the rate of retears is high: ranging from 10% to 78%. Healing of the repair cuff is a lengthy process during which the repaired tendon has to be unloading by carefully restricting active muscle contraction. This Phase I SBIR will develop an innovative wearable device with the potential to facilitate safe exercises, alert the patient during activities at risk for retears, and accelerate recovery while reducing the risk for retears. The device can also remotely monitor progress of the patient over the postoperative period and can modulate the feedback appropriate to the phase of recovery.",Wearable Sensors for Biofeedback & Remote Monitoring,10156598,R43AR078082,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biofeedback', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Immobilization', 'Implant', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Older Population', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Shoulder', 'Skin Temperature', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sports Medicine', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Swelling', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'healing', 'high risk', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'miniaturize', 'new technology', 'physical therapist', 'post-operative rehabilitation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'rotator cuff tear', 'sensor', 'success', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'trial comparing', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'wireless communication']",NIAMS,"ACTIVE4D, INC.",R43,2020,250998,-0.028264142494302775
"BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time. Project Summary/Abstract Health-risk behaviors, such as overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, and not adhering to medication, are responsible for increases in morbidity and mortality. To track and intervene during these health-risk behaviors, clinicians traditionally rely on self-reports. However, self-reports are inaccurate and biased. Therefore, we cannot use self-reports to validate health-risk behaviors in free-living conditions. Thus, an automated technique for validating health-risk behaviors is extremely necessary. With the growth and popularity of wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches), automatic monitoring of physical activity is possible. However, the devices often do not provide any visual confirmation, making it challenging to verify activities performed in free-living conditions. Cameras can capture point-of-view videos and can thus be used as a wearable device to capture videos for visual confirmation of activities, including health-risk behaviors. Such recordings can help us better understand health-risk behaviors. Additionally, video information can be automatically processed to confirm and validate health-risk behaviors. Recording videos of sensitive content and bystanders is associated with privacy and ethical concerns. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that can automatically detect health-risk behaviors, and most people are unwilling to wear cameras without raising privacy concerns. In addition to privacy concerns, people prefer wearables that are unobtrusive and small and that do not require frequent charging. Thus, a privacy-preserving, unobtrusive wearable camera would increase wearability. Infrared (IR) sensor arrays have the potential to provide independent temperature readings, which allows determining whether an object is near or far. The IR sensor array can help record only the wearer and objects near the wearer, while filtering out distant objects. IR sensor arrays have a small power footprint, thus providing longer battery life. Our project aims to develop a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection platform that will make it possible to detect and intervene upon health-risk behaviors in real time. In this project, we will (1) develop the wearable behavior-detection device that allows visual confirmation without burdening the wearer. The device will augment RGB camera data with IR sensor array data for privacy-conscious recording and automatic behavior detection. (2) We will test various designs to determine a user's acceptability to wear the device. Then, we will test various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the best algorithm for detecting health-risk behaviors. (3) We will incorporate the best-performing behavior-detection algorithm so that it can run on the developed wearable device. With a behavior-detection algorithm running on an acceptable wearable device, the ability to detect health-risk behaviors in real time will become a reality. Ultimately, our wearable device will allow researchers to test and apply appropriate behavioral interventions in real time, rather than relying on self-reports, whenever health-risk behaviors occur. Project Narrative Several activities involving hand-to-mouth gestures (e.g., overeating, smoking, consuming alcohol, or non- adherence to medication) are associated with health-risk behaviors that are a leading cause of preventable deaths. Being able to automatically monitor health-risk behaviors using wearable video cameras will improve our understanding of these behaviors and will ultimately enable us to design effective methods to intervene when they occur. We will develop BehaviorSight, a privacy-conscious, unobtrusive, wearable, behavior-detection device that will allow future researchers and behavioral scientists to use the device for monitoring numerous everyday health-risk behaviors in free-living settings.",BehaviorSight: Privacy enhancing wearable system to detect health risk behaviors in real-time.,10043674,R21EB030305,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dietitian', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hyperphagia', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'cost', 'data privacy', 'design', 'drinking', 'image processing', 'improved', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication nonadherence', 'miniaturize', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'privacy preservation', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,606713,-0.0003640453311647789
"Continuous Monitoring of COVID-19 Symptomatology for Elderly Patients in Long Term Care Facilities Using Advanced, Soft, and Flexible Sensors Mounted on the Suprasternal Notch PROJECT SUMMARY: COVID-19 is significantly more lethal in the elderly1 with the greatest risk in those cared for in long-term care facilities (LTCs) where mortality rates range from 19% to 72% worldwide. Monitoring COVID-19 infections in LTCs remains a particular challenging. The existing and a continued expected shortage of sufficient molecular COVID-19 testing coupled to false negative rates as high as 15% necessitates a critical need for new and complementary technologies that can surveil, alert, and track COVID-19 infections in this population. Our group are pioneers in the development of novel soft electronics. Our recent publication, supported by our active Phase I STTR, was published in Nature Biomedical Engineering detailing a next generation ultra-low profile, soft, and flexible sensor (ADAM) that continuously measures subtle acousto- mechanic signals generated by the body via an embedded high-frequency, 3-axis accelerometer in direct mechanical communication with the skin. The ADAM sensor communicates via Bluetooth with our custom mobile application for real time streaming as well as on sensor data storage enabling stand-alone operation. All data streams are cloud synchronized (HIPAA compliant). The highly novel soft, flexible nature allows for the ADAM sensor to be mountable on unusual locations of high information density. Specifically, we exploit the SN—the only location on the body where there is no dampening effect at the skin level with the intrathoracic cavity. This enables a SN- mounted ADAM sensor to capture heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature, physical activity (PA), swallow count, and talk time, along with additional novel respiratory biomarkers relevant to COVID-19. In this proposal, we propose to develop a new COVID-19 software package, machine learning enhancements to our cough algorithm, and validation in LTCs with both elderly patients and staff to evaluate usability, feasibility, and adherence. The high level of technology readiness with partner LTCs allows us to deploy efficiently to generate essential data for a future FDA Emergency Use Authorization. Our team of experts in engineering, dermatology, gerontology, and machine learning are highly qualified to develop this COVID-19 surveillance system that offers both commercial and clinical value with broad applicability to a wide range of other respiratory and chronic medical conditions after the pandemic subsides. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19 is significantly more lethal in the elderly resident in long-term care facilities.

"Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the proposed research and technology transfer effort is to develop a low-cost, point-of-care, mobile device-based technology for automated identification of Still's murmur, the most common innocent (benign and harmless) heart murmur of childhood. This novel technology could reduce the current rate of over half a million children unnecessarily referred to pediatric cardiologists by primary care providers each year in the United States. In Phase I, AusculTech Dx and Children's National Medical Center developed a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying Still's murmur with high accuracy (90% sensitivity, 99% specificity). To enable digital recording, essential for computerized murmur analysis, we also developed a digital stethoscope that connects to a smartphone and is equivalent in performance to a commercial stethoscope. Our envisioned product, called StethAid, is a combination of this novel digital stethoscope and a smartphone application (app). Having successfully met the Phase I performance milestones, we now propose to fully develop StethAid and conduct a multicenter trial through the following three specific aims: (1) develop and test a clinical-grade digital stethoscope, (2) develop fully feature software app, (3) conduct a multicenter trial of automated Still's murmur identification. For the multicenter trial, we have expanded our collaboration to include Boston Children's Hospital and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Our deliverable for Phase II is a technology platform validated by leading pediatric cardiologists that is ready for seeking regulatory approvals, deployment at PCP offices, and commercialization. As a decision support system, StethAid could empower PCPs to identify Still's murmur accurately and thus reduce the huge number of unnecessary specialist referrals. This should save the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars annually, allow pediatric cardiologists to focus on patients with serious conditions, and protect healthy children and their families from the unnecessary anxiety, inconvenience, and expense of seeing a pediatric cardiologist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over half a million children are referred unnecessarily to pediatric cardiologists by general physicians for the evaluation of Still's murmur, a normal and harmless heart murmur. This project will develop and clinically validate a novel mobile technology for automated recognition of this murmur in order to reduce the current rate of such unnecessary referrals and associated costs and inconvenience.",Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children,9903425,R42HL131081,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Apple', 'Benign', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart murmur', 'Incidence', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical center', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'sound', 'tool', 'wasting', 'web interface']",NHLBI,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R42,2020,708937,0.005757201204584053
"Reducing the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy with PointCheck: a portable non-invasive neutropenia analyzer Every year in the US, 650,000 cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy. As a side effect,  their neutrophil counts (number of white blood cells that aid in fighting infections) become low  (referred to as neutropenia) and expose them to febrile neutropenia (FN) which are episodes  of serious infection that entail costly hospitalization and sometimes death. If  neutropenia is detected early, FN can be avoided through timely delivery of  prophylactic antibiotics or growth stimulating factors. Currently, neutrophil measurements require  visits to healthcare centers. This increases infection risk (as measurements are taken infrequently  and low counts may not be detected before infections ensue) and reduces chemotherapy efficacy (as  chemotherapy levels are kept at the lower end of frequency and dose for safety). We aim to overcome  this limitation with PointCheck, a noninvasive neutrophil test that can be used frequently in  local health centers or at home, enabling physicians to minimize infections and  personalize chemotherapy planning. The basis for our technology is noninvasive optical imaging of  microcirculation in nailfold capillaries. We conducted a pilot clinical study where trained   nurses used PointCheck to acquire data from 46 chemotherapy patients. By manually analyzing  a training dataset (N=38 measurements from 16 patients), we built a labeled dataset of flow gaps in  the microcirculation that can be considered proxies of neutrophils and demonstrated their number  can be used to distinguish baseline patients (>500 neutrophils/mm3) from grade IV neutropenic ones  (<500/mm3). However, the need for manual analysis makes the technology inaccessible to patients on  its current status. With support from SBIR Phase I, we will (a) develop algorithms that automatize  the manual data processing workflow employed on our training set, (b) test those algorithms on our  acquired and unanalyzed testing database (N=103 measurements from 30 patients) and (c) generate  additional performance data including further intermediate neutrophil ranges (>500 and <1,500  neutrophils/mm3), thus fulfilling the requirements for a minimum viable product. The consecution of  these milestones will enable, in Phase II, using PointCheck in a multi-site diagnostic validation  trial to confirm, under clinical conditions, that the management of FN can be improved with this  new paradigm.

"Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water PROJECT SUMMARY Detrimental health impacts of lead are largely attributed to long-term exposures to undetected lead, which are particularly troublesome and problematic because of the neurological damage to children, a situation that should not be tolerated by an advanced society like the U.S. The Flint Water Crisis and many other water catastrophes could have been avoided if early warning can be made possible through timely detection of lead in drinking water at the point of use. Our extensive customer interviews unambiguously suggest that current options for lead detection are unsatisfactory for on-site testing, as they represent two extremes: one being accurate but expensive, slow, and hard to use; and the other being low-cost, fast, and easy to use but inaccurate. NanoAffix Science LLC (NAFX) proposes to address the above unmet need and niche market product gap by empowering water users (particularly those in economically disadvantaged communities) and water service providers with a low-cost, easy-to-use, and accurate handheld tester for rapid detection of total lead in the tap water, right from the kitchen sink. The handheld lead tester combines a novel proprietary micro-sized sensor chip embedded in a proprietary test cell with a portable digital meter for direct readout of testing results. The Phase I project has successfully established the feasibility for detection of soluble lead in the tap water using an earlier version of the prototype handheld tester. The Phase II project will continue to develop the handheld tester toward total lead detection, better device uniformity, pilot scale-up manufacturing, and accurate calibration. At the end of the Phase II project, NAFX plans to produce 20 beta units of the handheld lead tester meeting all performance specifications for field validation by 10 initial customers (e.g., schools/daycares, end water users, and well water drillers). Major innovations of the proposed approach include accurate prediction of the particulate lead through partial digestion based on lead digestion kinetics, and strategic and synergistic improvement of the ultimate sensor prediction accuracy by (1) improving the physical sensor device uniformity (both intra-wafer and inter-wafer) through innovative device configuration and rigorous quality control; and (2) improving the calibration accuracy through innovative theoretical equilibrium chemistry modeling and machine learning data analytics. The NAFX handheld lead tester is the first of its kind to (1) offer all three features sought by customers: accurate, cheap, and fast; and (2) to simultaneously report all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead), which thus can not only alert customers to the lead hazard in their drinking water but also enable customers to identify possible causes and most effective solutions to mitigate the lead contamination. Therefore, the project will result in not only considerable economic impact but also immense societal impact. The regular use of NAFX handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NanoAffix Phase II project aims to continue the development of a handheld lead tester for accurate and low- cost onsite detection of total lead in tap water by untrained users, based on the success of the Phase I project. The project will contribute to enhancing the public health by offering an accessible tool for quantitative monitoring of all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead) in tap water. The regular use of NanoAffix handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk.","Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water",10024064,R44ES028656,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Calibration', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Disinfection', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'International', 'Interview', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lead Poisoning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'Wireless Technology', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'drinking water', 'economic impact', 'empowered', 'graphene', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lead concentration', 'lead contamination', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'meetings', 'meter', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'operation', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water quality', 'well water']",NIEHS,"NANOAFFIX SCIENCE, LLC",R44,2020,719088,0.021675687272268925
"Clinical Evaluation of Burns using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Durkin, Anthony J. Abstract The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and apply a new, compact, clinic- friendly Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) device to objectively and non-invasively classify burn severity (burn grade) over a large areas of skin. Delays in determining burn severity directly impacts patient treatment plans (including decisions whether to graft), rates of infection and scarring, duration of hospitalization and ultimately cost of care. Currently, the primary method of determining burn severity continues to be clinical assessment, which is highly subjective. While both superficial thickness and full-thickness burns are typically readily diagnosed based on visual clinical impression, partial thickness burns are difficult to classify and carry with them considerable potential for complications. Burn severity classification accuracy, even by experts, is only 60–80%. Our research in animal models demonstrates that SFDI data can successfully be used to classify different regions of burn severities. Typically, these differences are not apparent to the unaided eye and a great deal of training and experience is required in order for clinicians to accurately differentiate them Our work using a research grade, hybrid-SFDI device suggests that objective parameters provided by SFDI can be used within 24 hours after injury, to accurately classify burn severity. Specifically, we have demonstrated in a porcine burn model that the research grade SFDI outperforms laser speckle imaging and thermal imaging at 24 hours post-burn, in terms of predicting whether a burn will require a graft or not. However, translating these results to the clinic has been difficult due to several device limitations. The research grade SFDI device has slow acquisition times that can result in motion artifacts. It is also sensitive to ambient light which is often an issue in a clinical setting. Additionally, the SFDI device generates so much diverse data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water fraction, reduced scattering coefficients at multiple wavelengths), there is no obvious way to present it to a clinical user to make a quick decision. To this end, we propose to methodically investigate an improved next generation SFDI device that addresses these issues by using brighter LEDs and fewer wavelengths to rapidly collect data in a way that reduces motion artifacts and is independent of clinical lighting conditions. In addition, we will develop a machine learning based classification framework that will provide the clinical with actionalble diagnostic information. The central aim of this 3 year competing R01 renewal is to characterize and then modify a new clinic-friendly SFDI device (Clarifi) to objectively classify in- vivo regions of different burn severity over large areas. The proposed research seeks to investigate this via the following Specific Aims: 1) Test & Validate Clinical SFDI Instrument, 2) Compare Clinical SFDI Instrument to other Modalities on a Long Term Swine Model of Graded Burns, 3) Develop Spatially Resolved Classification Maps of Burn Severity based on SFDI Data, 4) Conduct Clinical Measurements of Burn Severity using the new SFDI device and Spatially Resolved Burn Severity Classification Maps based on SFDI data. Program Director (Last, first, middle): Durkin, Anthony J. PROJECT NARRATIVE Burn injuries rank in the top 15 causes of global burden of disease. Burn severity assessment, which is a critical step in treatment planning, is subjective, depending on the experience of the treating physician. This leads to misdiagnosis and increased days of hospitalization and cost. In order to address this, we propose to test, validate and apply a novel optical imaging device in order to provide noninvasive objective assessment of burn wound severity.

"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,9998433,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2020,766675,-0.0022667416642942148
"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10153499,R43NS119015,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Blinking', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Epilepsy', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Shark', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tonic - clonic seizures', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'commercialization', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'premature', 'prospective', 'software systems', 'statistical and machine learning', 'visual tracking', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2020,511154,-0.01933432895539612
"An unobtrusive monitoring device used for tracking asthma symptoms and lungfunction variability Executive Summary of Predicate (One Page) Summary of Specific Aims of Phase I Specific Aim 1: Train and evaluate an algorithm to detect pediatric asthma symptoms (cough and wheeze) on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: 90% sensitivity; false alarm rate: 1 cough episode/day or 1 wheeze episode/day. Evaluate algorithm against medical expert (physician) scoring using the two best available asthma scoring tools (AS: asthma score; PRAM: Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure). Specific Aim 2: Design and evaluate algorithm to detect lung function variability on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: Using respiratory signals from sensor patch, detect variations ≥ 10% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). Evaluate algorithm against spirometry gold standard. Progress towards Specific Aims As of today, January 21, 2020, the work on the predicate NIH STTR award has not yet begun. The work related to this NIH STTR is anticipated to begin April 2020. Prior to submitting our NIH STTR application, significant work was completed to test the viability of collecting lung function using our wearable technology. We tested on over 20 patients in the hospital, and in this study we found a positive correlation between our measurements and those of spirometry. Our NIH STTR work will build upon this. Technical, administrative, or commercial challenges and how they’ve been addressed During our customer discovery so far, we have learned about the complexities of achieving reimbursement, even if we have identified applicable CPT codes. Realizing this challenge, we selected an initial customer that will not require reimbursement. Our initial customer will be respiratory clinical trials. From our interviews, we have learned that they have a strong unmet need, they are willing to pay a large amount, and we will be able to serve them earlier than other customer types.

"Automating and Obtaining FDA Approval for a Digital Intervention for Depression Phase IIB Abstract -FINAL A large body of evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of mood symptoms and full-blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely, that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to enhance our capacity to monitor and treat such conditions, with a particular emphasis on mood disorders. Our product vision capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to automatically and continuously sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of depressive symptomatology captured on a 24/7 basis in the user’s natural environment. It also capitalizes on the capacity of smartphones to deliver interventions that are easily accessible, can be delivered with optimal timing and, perhaps most important, are enormously scalable. Finally, smartphone technology gives us the capacity to bring empirically validated psychosocial interventions to the hundreds of thousands of depressed patients who otherwise would not be able to access such interventions and, thus, speed their recovery and prevent relapse. Under the auspices of our Phase II SBIR funding (R44MH113520-01-02), we have developed both such a monitoring product (Measure) and have developed and tested such a digital intervention platform (Cue). Analyses conducted to date indicate that Cue leads to significantly greater decreases in depressive symptomatology than monitoring alone via Measure. We now propose to: 1) upgrade to Cue and its accompanying clinician dashboard to be commercially marketable and 2) carry out the clinical trial necessary for FDA licensing of Cue 2.0 as a mobile device. Cue 2.0 will include enhanced designs, more in-depth psychoeducational material, and a fully automated engine for delivering behavior change suggestions to improve the regularity of users’ social and behavioral routines. Building on the accomplishments of our Phase II funding, this SBIR Phase IIB proposal is focused on bringing Cue to market as a scientifically validated and profitable digital intervention for individuals with depression with or without co-occurring anxiety disorder. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Develop and validate Cue 2.0 a fully automated digital intervention platform. Aim 2: Carry out all necessary steps to apply for FDA licensing of Cue 2.0.  PROJECT NARRATIVE HealthRhythms, Inc. is on a mission to become the world leader in tracking clinically meaningful behavioral rhythms in order to provide automated behavior change suggestions to patients around the globe. The work we propose in this SBIR Phase IIB application will enable HealthRhythms to further develop Cue, our smartphone-based intervention platform for depression, and carry out the work necessary to obtain FDA clearance for Cue as a medical device. This will enable us to bring a tested psychosocial treatment to the hundreds of thousands of depressed patients who otherwise would not be able to access such treatment and, thus, speed their recovery and prevent relapse.",Automating and Obtaining FDA Approval for a Digital Intervention for Depression,10081882,R44MH113520,"['Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consultations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'convict', 'dashboard', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'intimate behavior', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mood symptom', 'prevent', 'psychoeducational', 'psychosocial', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'usability']",NIMH,"HEALTH RHYTHMS, INC.",R44,2020,974672,-0.0064550984668140235
"Malarial Retinopathy Screening System for Improved Diagnosis of Cerebral Malaria Summary Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection. Annually, malaria affects more than 200 million people and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. As a consequence of the high incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading to a high false positive rate for CM and incorrect treatment. An accurate means to confirm the presence of CM or to investigate for a non-malarial illness is critically needed to improve outcomes. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 90% specific and sensitive to the presence of CM once clinically diagnosed, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. VisionQuest Biomedical and its collaborators have assembled a team of inter-disciplinary scientists with considerable experience in automated retinal image analysis, clinical ophthalmology with specialized research in malarial retinopathy (MR), and cerebral malaria diagnosis (CM). This team will develop and test ASPIRE, a system for detection of MR consisting of automated MR detection software integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera. Our proposed ASPIRE system will augment, not replace, the current CM diagnostic standard; increasing the accuracy of CM diagnoses, leading to a smaller number of false positive outcomes. In Phases I and II, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical developed the automated MR detection software and interfaced it with a handheld retinal camera. The resulting clinical prototype of ASPIRE was tested onsite in a health-clinic in Africa, which demonstrated excellent performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In Phase II-B, the MR detection system will be refined, productized, and the resulting commercial prototype will be validated on prospective datasets. We will accomplish this through three specific aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be adapted and improved to work with low-cost and portable iNview camera. In the second aim, we will refine iNview’s driver-software and integrate the camera with MR detection software to produce the first commercial prototype. The third aim will focus on collecting the retinal image data for algorithm testing as well as for validating the commercial prototype in an observational clinical study to be conducted at nine clinical sites in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia in Africa. Narrative Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection, which affects about 200 million people annually and claims the lives of over 440,000 people worldwide, mostly African children. The presence of malarial retinopathy can provide additional insight and improve the diagnostic accuracy of CM.

"New Photo-Acoustic Imaging Process in Fetal Monitoring to Dramatically Reduce Brain Injuries in Newborns PROJECT SUMMARY Summary The Brimrose Technology Corporation and Johns Hopkins University are forming a powerful new team to make a new instrument that has the potential to dramatically reduce a major global health problem–perinatal hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)–by enabling early detection during labor. HIE caused by asphyxia is a leading cause of infant fatalities as well as a source of cerebral palsy and other long-term severe neurologic impairments. The medical community has been limited in early diagnosis of HIE because current fetal heart rate monitoring has poor specificity. If identified early, HIE can be treated effectively with therapeutic hypothermia. We are proposing a fetal photoacoustic monitoring system that measures oxyhemoglobin saturation of the sagittal sinus vein draining the fetal cerebral cortex during labor. Sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation decreases to very low levels when placental gas exchange is impaired (hypoxia) and/or when fetal cerebral perfusion pressure falls (ischemia). The photoacoustic instrument transmits light through the open fontanelle or bone and into cerebral veins and tissue where ultrasound waves are generated. Using near- infrared incident light at discrete wavelengths that are absorbed preferentially by oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, ultrasound detected on the fetal scalp at each wavelength can estimate oxyhemoglobin saturation. Brimrose has constructed a novel ultrasound detection technology with sensitivity orders of magnitude greater than the current best-use piezo-electric sensors. This will permit the use of low-power LED light sources rather than cumbersome laser lights now employed, thereby avoiding safety goggle use and promoting greater deployment. The Hopkins team has already validated the ability of a standard photoacoustic system to accurately estimate sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation through the skull of newborn piglets. The purpose of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of using safe, low power LED light sources with the new ultrasensitive ultrasound sensor to detect critically low sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation when oxygenation is manipulated. The platform will be based on in-silico simulation to optimize the acoustic and optical pathways for the skull and brain. Real-time measurements on a time scale of seconds will inform the obstetric caregiver of dynamic fluctuations of brain oxygenation during contractions. The Phase II goal is to make a miniaturized photoacoustic device prototype that can report on fetal brain oxygenation. We believe the resulting instrument will provide early detection brain HI with greater specificity and sensitivity, enabling early intervention and treatment and is potentially transferrable to a commercial model for manufacture. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Brimrose Technology Corporation and the Johns Hopkins University propose making a new instrument to potentially dramatically reduce the incidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), which can result in mortality or lifelong disabilities. Our goal is to develop an intrapartum fetal brain monitor using photoacoustics with inexpensive, safe and clinically convenient light emitting diodes (LEDs) to noninvasively and instantaneously identify the fetus at risk for brain injury. Phase I is intended to provide a proof-of-concept using low power LED light sources and a novel ultrasensitive ultrasound detector rather than standard laser light sources and piezo-electric detectors.",New Photo-Acoustic Imaging Process in Fetal Monitoring to Dramatically Reduce Brain Injuries in Newborns,10010328,R43HD102260,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Aluminum', 'Animals', 'Asphyxia', 'Auscultation', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebral perfusion pressure', 'Cerebrum', 'Cesarean section', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electricity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoxia', 'Imaging Device', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neodymium', 'Neonatal', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Oxyhemoglobin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perinatal anoxic ischemic brain injury', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sagittal Sinus', 'Scalp structure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure of fontanel of skull', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Yttrium', 'absorption', 'base', 'bone', 'cerebral oxygenation', 'cerebral vein', 'chromophore', 'commercialization', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'cranium', 'detector', 'disability', 'energy density', 'falls', 'fetal', 'fetal brain injury', 'fetus at risk', 'global health', 'hazard', 'heart rate monitor', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intrapartum', 'light scattering', 'machine learning method', 'microphone', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'natural hypothermia', 'neonatal brain', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'novel', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'sound', 'temporal measurement', 'virtual']",NICHD,BRIMROSE TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION,R43,2020,74989,-0.008438698903290827
"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources.

"Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries Project Summary: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. Advancing a tool such as an electrode, injection pipette or optical fiber through a small hole in the cranium, sometimes over long distances, and placing it precisely in a particular brain area, often much less than one millimeter in diameter, is a significant experimental challenge. Any time an investigator misses the target brain area and the experiment fails as a result, a significant amount of work is lost, additional animals get sacrificed, materials are wasted, and the pace of scientific discovery has been slowed. Even in cases when experiments succeed, they can be difficult to reproduce because many research groups rely on their most experienced lab members and their “special touch” to perform these procedures – thereby adding an element of non- quantitativeness to the procedures, effectively making the experiment less reproducible. We propose to develop a novel stereotaxic apparatus which will overcome many of these shortcomings. Our device features a radically different mechanical design which is natively compatible with both traditional and novel in-vivo techniques. We propose to combine computer 3D vision and robotics for automatic and software guided adjustments of the animal's skull. Landmarks are measured with 3D vision, based on structured illumination at a level of accuracy that has not been accomplished by any of the existing devices. This information will guide a robotic platform to position the animal for the experiment. Finally, we propose to develop an open software platform for neuronavigation that will allow investigators to use the platform with any small animal species they desire to use. Brain atlas systems for neuronavigation can either be downloaded from a cloud based site, or produced de-novo by the investigator by preparing a single set of MRI and CT scans from one sample animal. Our device will help make stereotaxic procedures more accurate and less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Narrative: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. These devices will help make stereotaxic procedures less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Most importantly, they will help reduce or eliminate failed experiments due to mistargeted interventions, thereby accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.",Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries,10080673,R41NS119079,"['3-Dimensional', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Monitor', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age group', 'base', 'bone', 'bone imaging', 'brain tissue', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cranium', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic strain', 'hexapod', 'in vivo', 'laboratory experience', 'member', 'millimeter', 'novel', 'operation', 'optical fiber', 'programs', 'prototype', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'wasting']",NINDS,POPNEURON LTD.,R41,2020,251960,-0.01510963879859246
"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9858205,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'emotional functioning', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2020,2217090,-0.0066404990115939274
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,9863048,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,828534,0.012945040797660873
"Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates Summary/Abstract Each year, about 5-18% of babies are born preterm, accounting for over 0.5M births in the US and 15M globally. Many of these babies are admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) where the medical staff generally have the option of using either invasive arterial lines (IALs) or inflatable-cuff non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring. The former introduces the risk of infection, tissue and nerve damage, and the latter is less accurate, especially for hypotensive infants, and may add the risk of ischemic and nerve damage upon repeated measurement. There is a clear need for a safer, continuous, and cost effective form of NIBP measurement to meet the challenge of managing unhealthy blood pressures for neonates. PyrAmes Inc. has developed a novel capacitive sensor technology that is paper thin and flexible and can accurately detect blood pressure (BP). This sensor technology is part of a unique continuous BP monitoring platform that provides accurate, lightweight and comfortable BP monitoring in a wireless, wrist-worn package that is easy to use. The system uses lightweight neural networks to analyze pulse waveform data to provide continuous determination of systolic, diastolic, and mean BP, heart rate, and their variabilities. The sensor is easy to apply non-invasively and records pulsatile data similar to an arterial line, while avoiding the difficulties of placing and maintaining an arterial line. This device can provide gold standard BP monitoring without perturbing the patients for more accurate and relevant measurements. The objective of this project is to extend the platform for use with term and pre-term neonates. This goal will be accomplished through redesign of the sensor hardware and optimization of the data analytics software. We will validate these modifications with clinical data from the NICU at Stanford University Medical Center. In Phase I, we will miniaturize the electronics and modify the sensor array of a wrist-worn pulse wave monitor to be sized more appropriately for neonates. We will validate the new device design by collecting NICU clinical data from patients who have IALs in place in an IRB-approved study. From IAL and sensor data taken simultaneously, we will determine ground truth values on a pulse-by-pulse basis and use these data in conjunction with additional IAL data from historical databases to improve our sensor quality and predictive BP models. Our success metric will be to equal or exceed the quality and accuracy of our data for adults. Phase II will be a follow-up IRB-approved pivotal study using the device from Phase 1 to position our device for FDA submission and clearance and scale up to pilot production of this device. Project Narrative The goal of this Phase 1 project is to confirm that machine learning can be used to extract blood pressure values for critically ill neonates from pulse waveform data collected with a wearable, non-invasive device that is comfortable, low-cost and easy to use. The proposed device will significantly reduce the need for frequent cuff-based measurements and/or invasive arterial lines, thereby decreasing morbidity, risk of complications, patient discomfort, and overall cost of care. This project is based on the pioneering efforts of Prof. Zhenan Bao’s lab at Stanford on thin film sensors for electronic skin and includes the design and use of a miniaturized device to collect clinical data from neonates that will be used to validate a model which derives blood pressure values from the pulse waveform without external calibration.",Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Neonates,9910153,R43HD101175,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Area', 'Arterial Lines', 'Birth', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood pressure determination', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Coin', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronics', 'Female', 'Film', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Infant', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Staff', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Nerve', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Pain', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'encryption', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'light weight', 'male', 'miniaturize', 'neonate', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pressure', 'preterm newborn', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'success', 'tonometry']",NICHD,"PYRAMES, INC.",R43,2020,224556,0.03338333037173859
"A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions Abstract. Melanoma is the third most common form of skin cancer with estimated 87,110 new cases diagnosed in the United States in the year 2017. Current routine diagnostic approaches utilize microscopic evaluation of thinly sectioned patient biopsies, but in certain cases diagnosis can be contentious even among experts. The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize MelanoMap™, Frontier Diagnostics' patented assay for the diagnosis of melanoma using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) platform—and to have this assay available to pathologists in the U.S. as a laboratory developed test. MALDI IMS is a state-of-the-art technology that generates molecular images of tens to thousands of biomolecules from tissue sections in a single analysis. The assay uses formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies used in routine histopathological diagnosis. The proposed assay has pathologists select regions of skin biopsies for analysis via a remote web interface. The acquired IMS data from those regions unambiguously identifies malignant melanoma or benign nevus.  Phase I of this proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of this technology platform to achieve cost-effective diagnosis of melanoma from patient skin biopsies at sample volumes acceptable for a clinical laboratory. Specific Aim 1 focuses on the development of a scalable and robust analytical protocol in both sample preparation and informatics to accurately diagnose melanoma with MALDI IMS. In specific aim 2, we will test the methodology developed in Specific Aim 1 on a cohort of melanocytic lesions with known clinical outcome and subsequently validate the classification accuracy of the proposed test  In Phase II, the protocols developed in Phase I will be integrated into a diagnostic service workflow. This phase will focus on quality control measures, client facing cloud software, clinical diagnostic reporting, and completing the analysis of a 500-patient sample set for final assay validation. Specific Aim 3 of this proposal (initial aim of Phase II) will establish and implement test tissues into standard workflows that will provide performance metrics for standard operation of a test meeting Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards. Protocols will be developed to monitor reagents, the reproducibility of sample preparation, and mass spectrometer performance on daily basis. Specific Aim 4 will expand software capabilities to include a secure web interface for clients ordering the test and the laboratory performing the test. The software will meet regulatory compliance, perform statistical analysis, and generate and communicate reports of the MALDI IMS analysis. Specific Aim 5 proposes to expand the sample set used in the initial assay from Specific Aim 2 to include a set of 300 patient samples from our clinical collaborators with 5 or more years follow-up data. The test will be independently validated by an additional 200 patient samples with definitive diagnoses. n/a",A Molecular Diagnostic Assay for Accurately Differentiating Melanoma from Benign Lesions,9926849,R44CA228897,"['Antigens', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Digestion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Microscopic', 'Microtomy', 'Monitor', 'Nevus', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physical shape', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Side', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States', 'Validation', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cloud software', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease classification', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'histopathological examination', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mass spectrometer', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality risk', 'operation', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'skin lesion', 'tissue preparation', 'web interface']",NCI,"FRONTIER DIAGNOSTICS, LLC",R44,2020,944492,0.007734011546767869
"Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD) PROJECT SUMMARY Medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that can leach and cause acute contact dermatitis (ACD) after repeated exposure or prolonged contact of the skin to these toxins. ACD is credited for 10-15% of all occupational illnesses and is also the second highest reported occupational hazard. Given its prevalence, ACD is also a great public health burden with combined yearly costs of up to $1 billion, which spans including medical costs, worker’s compensation and lost working time due to workplace absence. To this end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has mandated that all medical devices must be evaluated for possible skin sensitization using in vivo animal assays, which includes the Guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Although GPMT tests provide valuable data on the skin sensitization effects of potential toxins, these assays are time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) recently published a Strategic Roadmap, calling for the development of alternative approaches to reduce animal testing of chemical and medical agents. Thus, there is a stated need to modernize safety evaluation of medical devices to reduce animal testing and shorten the regulatory review time, which would ultimately bring safer devices to the market faster. To address this unmet need, the key objectives of our FDA Phase I SBIR project are to (i) produce rigorously validated computational models for the GPMT assay integrating data obtained in human, mouse, and in vitro assays; and (ii) integrate these models into a software product termed PreSS/MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices). Our specific aims for this study include: 1) collecting, curating, and integrating the largest publicly available dataset for GMPT; 2) creating and validating novel computational models for GMPT data; 3) developing the PreSS/MD web server to allow users to make predictions of skin sensitization potential in medical devices. We will also develop a model for mixtures, including compounds tested jointly in different concentrations, using an approach that we developed previously. Finally, we will implement novel approaches to help users of our PreSS/MD platform interpret the developed models in terms of key chemical features responsible for skin sensitization. In addition, we will employ biomedical knowledge graphs to elucidate Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) for skin sensitizers. Successful execution of this Phase I project will yield in the development of PreSS/MD as a centralized resource to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices. We expect this software-as-a-service web server platform will be of great value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that may lead to allergic contact dermatitis, the US Food and Drug Administration requires that all devices be evaluated for possible skin sensitization effects using in vivo assays such as the Guinea pig maximization test. In the effort to modernize skin sensitization safety evaluation methods to reduce in vivo animal testing, herein we propose to develop a software product, PreSS/-MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization caused by Medical Devices), as an innovative and unique in silico alternative with the potential to better predict human response compared to the existing approaches for skin sensitization assessment. Successful execution of the objectives described in this project will result in a centralized web server platform to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices, which will be of significant value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices.",Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD),10079701,R43ES032371,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Allergic Contact Dermatitis', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Assay', 'Cavia', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Contact Dermatitis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Instruction', 'Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Occupational', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Prevalence', 'Prostheses and Implants', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxin', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Workers&apos', ' Compensation', 'Workplace', 'adverse outcome', 'chemical release', 'cost', 'experience', 'in silico', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'knowledge graph', 'lymph nodes', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'occupational hazard', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'response', 'skin patch', 'software as a service', 'success', 'systemic toxicity', 'tool', 'web portal', 'web server']",NIEHS,"PREDICTIVE, LLC",R43,2020,167910,0.006635830555265806
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer.

"A portable photoacoustic imager for diagnosing vascular diseases Project Summary/Abstract Vascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Some common vascular diseases include: cardio vascular disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Many of these vascular diseases need point-of- care (POC) diagnosis and monitoring using non-ionizing, non-invasive and cost-effective approaches. Although Doppler ultrasound meets all these requirements, it only maps blood flow, which is operator dependent and influenced by motion artifacts, resulting in limited sensitivity and specificity to detect the disease in its early stage. A POC technique that provides direct label-free molecular and functional information of vasculature is needed to reliably detect and monitor vascular diseases.  A mobile photoacoustic imager (mPAI) is proposed for diagnosing various vascular diseases in resource poor settings of the world. Leveraging on strong multispectral optical absorption of oxy- and de-oxy hemoglobins, the mPAI is capable of providing multi-parametric information of deep vasculature, such as blood oxygen saturation, plaque lipids, blood flow and blood clot. The mPAI is non-invasive, real time and uses non-ionizing optical and ultrasound radiation. This will be the first and perhaps the only portable technology capable of deriving such multiparametric functional information of deep vasculature without the use of contrast agents. Competing technologies cannot provide such a direct information of vascular health, and certainly not in a compact portable device form. Health care providers can use the mPAI to instantly diagnose several vascular diseases affecting humans of all ages, including infants.  In the R21 phase, Aim1 will design and develop the mPAI, integrating the low-cost optical illumination and piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) arrays. Dr. Rundra Pratap team from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, will design and fabricate the PMUT arrays. Dr. Kothapalli team will develop the mPAI and validate its performance on tissue mimicking vascular phantoms in Aim 1, and rat models of PAD in Aim 2. The ultimate goal of the two-year R21 phase is to achieve a clinical grade mPAI device with reliable vascular imaging metrics.  In the R33 phase, to test the clinical performance of the mPAI, the following multicenter pilot clinical studies on PAD patients will be conducted in 1) Penn State Hershey medical center, 2) Vikram Hospital in India through collaborations with the IISc team, and 3) in Ghana in Year 5 with the help of Dr. Colette Pameijer of Penn State who conducts medical camps in Ghana every year through Penn State Global Health Program. Clinical studies in R33 phase will be undertaken only if well-defined milestones are achieved in the R21 phase.  The overall goal of these studies is to carefully validate the clinical potential of emerging label-free photoacoustic imaging technology to screen for vascular diseases, in a portable form, in resource poor settings of the world. Project Narrative Vascular diseases are becoming epidemic with increase in aging population, obesity and type II diabetes. They affect humans of all age groups, including neonates.

"Feelix @ Home: Testing and optimization of a smart stethoscope for home use to monitor changes in lung status of individuals with chronic conditions Project Summary  The goal of this project is to further develop an existing smart stethoscope in order to be capable of monitoring pediatric patients at home who suffer from asthma as well as adults with COPD. Lung diseases impose a serious burden on healthcare systems, individuals and governments. The World Health Organization (WHO) found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lower respiratory infections (LRIs) ranked third and fourth as the leading causes of death in 2016, each claiming 3 million lives annually. LRIs accounted for 14.9% of pediatric deaths, making it the leading cause of infant mortality after pre-term birth. Asthma—a condition for which, like COPD, there is no cure—is also the leading chronic disease in children and an estimated 235 million people suffer from the disease worldwide, with over 380,000 deaths from the disease in 2015. Asthma and COPD costed the United States approximately $56 billion and $72 billion last year, respectively. The burden of these diseases and the health disparities across populations is only slated to get worse in the coming decade, as respiratory diseases are expected to increase by 155% due to an aging population and increased pollution, while there is expected to a large shortage of pulmonary specialists, with an expect 7% decline by 2030.  We reasoned that a long-term monitoring solution that can be used in the home by untrained patients, or family members of patients, that could detect and monitor severity of airway inflammation in patients, provide insight into reasons for worsening or improved symptoms, push tailored educational content, and direct patients to medical follow before the situation becomes acute, would empower patients with chronic conditions while also reducing trips to emergency departments and readmission rates to hospitals. We find that several challenges exist when considering long term auscultatory monitoring solutions in non-traditional clinical settings: (1) unpredictable ambient noise, (2) the need for medical expertise to interpret lung sounds, (3) subjectivity in the analysis, and (4) difficulty using and placing the stethoscope. The research team developed a smart stethoscope that was originally intended for use in low-resource countries by community health workers to differentiate between pediatric patients with crackles and wheezes that overcomes many of these challenges. This smart stethoscope address all the challenges above by including (1) adaptive noise suppression that has been objectively and subjectively proven to be superior in all types of noise environments than traditional or other electronic stethoscopes, (2) on-board analysis algorithms that can detect crackles and wheezes in pediatric patients with an accuracy that matches that of a specialist, and (3) a uniform pickup surface that removes the requirement for exact placement of the device to get an accurate recording. In this project, we will validate that the device can be correctly used by parents of children with asthma and accurate recordings can be taken that are similar in quality to those that would be taken by a medical professional. Simultaneously, we will be using patient feedback to iterate on the device and mobile app design to create a version that patients are comfortable using in their home. Once the device and app have been validated in Phase I, we plan to move into directly into Phase II where the device will enter in a second phase of investigation that will include a first-time longitudinal study from parents of pediatric patients taking daily recordings in their home. This data will then be used for the development of algorithms to determine lung sound severities with metrics that can be tracked and predicted over time. In parallel to the this clinical study and algorithm development, recordings will be taken of adult patients with COPD to expand the usability of the device beyond pediatrics. Project Narrative This proposal aims to validate a smart auscultation device for home use and develop algorithms that can track changes in, and severity of, lung sounds in order to monitor patients over long periods of time, improve the clinical relevance of home monitoring for timely interventions, and decrease hospital admissions. Current state of the art technology available to patients suffering from asthma and COPD is unable to intelligently monitor patients at home and no long-term monitoring solutions exist for these conditions, resulting in increases in emergency department visits. The academic partner has developed a smart stethoscope that offers greatly improved audio fidelity in any type of noise environment, automated on-board analysis and detection algorithms of lung sounds, and increased ease of use. The small business partner is in the process of commercializing the device for clinical use by trained, professional personnel. Together, we are aiming to test whether the device can be reliably used by non-trained personnel for home use, develop algorithms that would provide metrics for monitoring trends and severities of lung sounds and predict future severity, expand the current abilities of the stethoscope from pediatrics to all patients, and transfer this technology to the small business partner for further clinical testing and commercial development such that it can improve the long-term outcome for patients with chronic lung conditions.",Feelix @ Home: Testing and optimization of a smart stethoscope for home use to monitor changes in lung status of individuals with chronic conditions,9909859,R42HL147728,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Auditory', 'Auscultation', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Community Health Aides', 'Cost of Illness', 'Country', 'Crackles', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Respiratory Tract Infection', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Stethoscopes', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untrained Personnel', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'aging population', 'airway inflammation', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'computer aided detection', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy trial', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mobile application', 'monitoring device', 'pediatric patients', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatic improvement', 'trend', 'usability']",NHLBI,"SONAVI LABS, INC.",R42,2020,236489,-0.07112189071097065
