"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,9835005,F32GM134595,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fellowship', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Freedom', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'base', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human data', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical sciences', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61610,-0.006144649180925568
"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,9896942,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,362352,0.007608848229948408
"Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms Project Summary The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven valuable as a model for many high-impact medical conditions. The strength of C. elegans derives from the extensive homologies between human and nematode genes (60-80%) and the many powerful tools available to manipulate genes in C. elegans, including expressing human genes. Researchers utilizing medical models based on C. elegans have converged on two main quantifiable measures of health and disease: locomotion and feeding; the latter is the focus of this proposal. C. elegans feeds on bacteria ingested through the pharynx, a rhythmic muscular pump in the worm’s throat. Alterations in pharyngeal activity are a sensitive indicator of dysfunction in muscles and neurons, as well as the animal’s overall health and metabolic state. C. elegans neurobiologists have long recognized the utility of the elec- tropharyngeogram (EPG), a non-invasive, whole-body electrical recording analogous to an electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides a quantitative readout of feeding. However, technical barriers associated with whole- animal electrophysiology have limited its adoption to fewer than fifteen laboratories world-wide. NemaMetrix Inc. surmounted these barriers by developing a turn-key, microfluidic system for EPG acquisition and analysis called the the ScreenChip platform. The proposed research and commercialization activities significantly expand the capabilities of the ScreenChip platform in two key respects. First, they enlarge the phenotyping capabilities of the platform by incorporating high-speed video of whole animal and pharyngeal movements. Second they develop a cloud database compatible with Gene Ontology, Open Biomedical Ontologies and Worm Ontology standards, allowing data-mining of combined electrophysiological, imaging and other data modalities. The machine-readable database will be compatible with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. It will be accessible to all researchers to enable discovery of relationships between genotypes, phenotypes and treatments using large-scale analysis of multidimensional phenotypic profiles. The research and commercialization efforts culminate in an unprecedented integration of genetic, cellular, and organismal levels of analysis, with minimal training and effort required by users. Going forward, we envision the PheNom platform as a gold standard for medical research using C. elegans. n/a",Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms,9671422,R44GM119906,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Amplifiers', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Feeds', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ingestion', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Locomotion', 'Market Research', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Pump', 'Readability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Microscopy', 'addiction', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'commercialization', 'data mining', 'design', 'feeding', 'human disease', 'human model', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'phenotypic data', 'prevent', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'web app']",NIGMS,"NEMAMETRIX, INC.",R44,2019,475637,0.004939150261200695
"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns,9886424,K23NS110927,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Archives', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Physiology', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lobar', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'arteriole', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain parenchyma', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypertension control', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'risk variant', 'serial imaging', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,179997,-0.018966101457554868
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,9661406,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Community Medicine', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,404309,-0.010615092019225277
"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed understanding of admixture is essential for effective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on phenotype are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simplified models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This proposal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to leverage this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate powerful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as effectively as homogeneous populations. The first step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statistical framework to infer fine-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop effective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major impact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to efficiently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human phenotypes, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on fine-scale genomic structure and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can benefit from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,9774249,R35GM125055,"['Admixture', 'Alleles', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic evolution', 'insight', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'structural genomics', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2019,332952,0.009290447042075184
"Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks The goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods that will identify genes driving epistasis between quantitative trait loci. Genetic association studies in both humans and model organisms have been increasingly able to detect interactions among genetic variants that influence disease risk and pathogenesis. However, identifying which genes are represented by individual variants is a major challenge. Many variants influencing disease are situated between genes, and even those that are in genes may be representing an effect from a neighboring gene. In model organism studies the situation is even more problematic. In breeding experiments, genetic associations with phenotypes typically encompass large regions of DNA with many genes, and experimental follow-up to identify the genes responsible for the association is resource-intensive. To address this problem, we are developing computational tools to prioritize putative gene interactions in interacting genomic regions for biological follow-up. We use machine learning classifiers trained on functional gene-gene interaction networks and combinatorial optimization to identify likely candidate gene-gene interactions responsible for epistatic interactions between genomic regions. Our methods sift through enormous spaces of candidate interactions, retaining only those whose functional interactions identify as plausible for supporting the epistatic interaction. These tools hold promise to dramatically limit the resource-intensity of biological follow up of putative epistasis and to clarify the genetic architecture of complex disease. Genetic studies in humans and model organisms are critical to understanding how genes interact to influence disease. Standard association studies, however, do not identify individual genes, but rather large genetic regions containing many genes, and determining individual genes responsible for phenotypic effects requires resource-intensive biological follow-up experiments. We are developing computational methods to prioritize genes in these regions for biological follow-up, with the ultimate goal of speeding the discovery of novel roles of genes in disease.",Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks,9712956,R21LM012615,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Breeding', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Letters', 'Lower Organism', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'mutant', 'novel', 'supervised learning', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2019,223200,-0.03299758868706389
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9672510,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2019,336445,-0.00806619603052847
"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",9801992,R01GM134056,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Complement', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Homeostasis', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Model', 'Plants', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Toxin', 'Transgenes', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biophysical properties', 'bisulfite', 'density', 'epigenetic memory', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'trait', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2019,319720,-0.01575989019147493
"Identification of gene-gene interactions in relation to risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is an often lethal cancer and a significant public health concern in the U.S. Several risk factors have been identified for EA and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE), including symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), central adiposity, smoking, male sex, and European ancestry, but our understanding of the molecular/genetic determinants that govern why most people with reflux never develop BE, and most with BE never progress to EA, remains limited. Inherited genetics represents another likely contributor to disease susceptibility, and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) within the Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON) have identified multiple novel germline genetic variants associated with altered risk of BE/EA. As observed for other cancers and complex diseases, however, the majority of estimated heritability for BE and EA appears unexplained. One plausible source for this “missing heritability” lies in the joint effects of multiple loci acting in combination. We seek to identify novel gene-gene interactions (G×G) in relation to risk of BE/EA, using a novel fusion of advanced analytical approaches aimed at overcoming technical limitations often encountered in the conduct of large-scale G×G (e.g. computational complexity and low statistical power). In a discovery scan (Aim 1), we initially will use two complementary knowledge-guided filtering methods to reduce the dimensionality of the G×G search space: first, we select ~500 genes with known or hypothesized relationships to BE/EA etiology and pathogenesis based on findings from GWAS, TCGA, and related studies; second, we select ~50,000 gene-gene pairs with highest-likelihood annotated biological relationships based on an integrated knowledge resource of pathways, processes, and interactions (Biofiler). Using existing germline genetic data on 2515 EA patients, 3295 BE patients, and 3207 controls from BEACON, we next will adopt a recently-described `hierarchical group-lasso' machine learning framework to select, in a joint model, ~1000 candidate pairwise SNP-SNP interactions most predictive of case status. These interactions are then evaluated using an independent validation dataset of 1609 EA cases, 1037 BE cases, and 3537 controls (Aim 2), using standard logistic regression models. In exploratory work, we will perform stratified analyses by sex or smoking history. The proposed studies are anticipated to expand our basic understanding of key biological pathways and mechanisms underlying the emergence of BE/EA; generate new leads and possible candidate targets for interventional strategies; and expand the foundation for future collaborative initiatives to integrate genetic, epidemiologic, and clinical data into robust disease models and novel predictive tools for BE/EA risk assessment and precision prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is an often lethal cancer that represents a significant public health burden in the U.S. In this proposal, we capitalize on the availability of large-scale existing datasets derived from expensive multi-year international collaborations, and perform new analyses to improve our understanding of how inherited gene variants interact to influence susceptibility to EA and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE). Findings from this study will expand our basic understanding of key biological pathways underlying this cancer and ultimately help advance the development of better strategies for prevention and treatment.",Identification of gene-gene interactions in relation to risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus,9746654,R03CA223731,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Inherited', 'Intercept', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lesion', 'Life Style', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metaplastic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Target', 'Obesity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reflux', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically actionable', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R03,2019,93591,-0.02402951865327186
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9694279,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2019,341691,-0.03785684534417035
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets. We will address these major problems with current genetic toxicity assays by developing new methods and associated commercial assay kits.",Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity,9807074,R44ES029014,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aneugens', 'Antioxidants', 'Appearance', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Bleomycin', 'Caspase', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Colcemid', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-PKcs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Epitopes', 'Etoposide', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'GADD45A gene', 'Gamma-H2AX', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'NF-kappa B', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Stains', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'clastogen', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genotoxicity', 'hazard', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'next generation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'targeted agent', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2019,482291,0.002747911012300485
"Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Title: Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Project Summary  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. Risk assessment of influenza viruses is a key component in pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP), and it can help optimize resources for influenza surveillance, vaccine development and other control measurements to help minimize losses due to an emerging influenza virus. Risk assessment of influenza viruses includes emergence risk and public health impact of novel influenza viruses. Emergence risk assesses the probability for a novel influenza virus to infect and easily spread among humans; it is the first risk to be evaluated in risk assessment.  Although a number of individual mutations or structural/functional motifs have been reported to be associated with influenza infection and transmission, their effects on emergence risk are difficult to predict a priori. Thus, conventional methods for assessment of the emergence risk of a novel IAV often require laboratory generation of reassortants and subsequent measurement of their infectivity, pathogenesis, and transmission, which is often done in a mammalian system. However, this strategy can lead to laboratory mutants with gain of function (i.e., mutants with new or enhanced activity on pathogenesis and/or transmissibility in mammals). Thus, an ideal system for influenza risk assessment should be able to quantify emergence risk for a novel IAV solely by using genomic sequences.  Avian influenza A viruses facilitated the emergence of all four known pandemic human influenza A viruses: the hemagglutinin genes of 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic viruses are all of avian origin, and the polymerase PB2 and PA genes of the 2009 pandemic virus are of avian origin. Risk assessment of potential reassortants from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses has been a key component of the pandemic influenza preparedness process.  The objectives of this study are to develop and validate a machine learning method to assess the emergence risk for a novel IAV using genomic sequences. The study will focus on emergence risk from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses. We expect to identify genetic features within and across gene segments and ascertain their synergistic effects as emergence risk determinants. We also expect to develop a computational model for estimating the probability of a possible reassortant to emerge, given the genomic sequences of one human influenza virus and one avian influenza virus. The study results should help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and with assessing emergence risk of influenza virus; thus, the results should facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness. Project Narrative This project will develop a computational model for influenza risk assessment, and it will help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and for assessing the emergence risk of influenza viruses, and thus the project will facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness.",Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses,9693661,R21AI135820,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Birds', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Funding', 'Gene Combinations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Reassortant Viruses', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'cost', 'enzootic', 'flu transmission', 'gain of function', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic influenza', 'transmission process', 'vaccine development', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,5173,-0.024152209737662873
"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,9684263,R01AR073882,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cadaver', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Harvest', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of shoulder region', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'design', 'epigenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preclinical study', 'progenitor', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'rotator cuff tear', 'scaffold', 'spatial relationship', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'tendon development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'translation to humans']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,485405,-0.013059422377110733
"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. To address our aims we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of approximately 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans.",Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race,9626929,K01HL127278,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Biometry', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Competence', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Inflammation', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Modification', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Parents', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'caucasian American', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'gene interaction', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'lifestyle factors', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nutrition', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'response']",NHLBI,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2019,139144,0.0005958086367741514
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9746755,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,400001,-0.018884100189377643
"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9666459,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,191250,0.009553045052530098
"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,9739114,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Cell Death', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Deacetylation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HDAC7 histone deacetylase', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous body substance', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic platform', 'healthspan', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel strategies', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'programs', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,483750,-0.01806813538460994
"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community. The proposed work will advance the ﬁeld of statistical genomics and facilitate trans-omics precision medicine studies of chronic diseases.

"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9757833,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2019,4129117,-0.00915549599098751
"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared. Finally, an exploratory aim will use the PRS scores from the PGC data to generate risk scores in the lab sample to examine if there is a genetic association with conditioning deficits.  To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals. These goals will incorporate training in the epidemiology and genetics of AUD and PTSD, molecular and statistical genetics techniques, and conduct of clinical laboratory paradigms using genetic and psychophysiological measures. This training and resultant findings will capitalize on existing expertise and provide additional, focused training to allow for the development of a multimodal research program that uses large-scale genetic association findings to develop mechanism-focused laboratory studies that inform upon the development and maintenance of this complex presentation. The proposed research represents an important contribution towards advancing our understanding of the complicated and frequently comorbid phenotypes of AUD and PTSD. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing an independent research line that ultimately aims to decrease the burden of alcohol-related problems, consistent with NIAAA research priority. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur, and some of the genetic risk for these conditions is shared. This project aims to elucidate the shared molecular genetic risk and examine potential learning-based mechanisms common to both disorders, by linking large-scale genome-wide data with a clinical laboratory study. This K01 award will provide the candidate with the training necessary to pursue a multimodal program of research that aims to synthesize genetically informed research with laboratory studies of mechanism to inform upon the shared underpinnings of AUD and PTSD and advance work aimed at improving prevention and treatment efforts.",Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder,9689882,K01AA025692,"['Address', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Twin Studies', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular scale', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'psychogenetics', 'responsible alcohol use', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'trait', 'trauma exposure']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,172364,-0.04570604630240357
"PiNDA - Fully integrated software platform for Preimplantation Genetic Testing - Aneuploidy (PGT-A) PROJECT SUMMARY  Since its inception 40 years ago, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of more than 1 million babies in the United States, and has revolutionized the field of reproductive medicine. Unfortunately, the success rate of IVF is still exceedingly low, especially for women >40 years old, with only 15.5% of implanted embryos resulting in pregnancy. This is partly due to the cytological method used for pre-implantation screening, which cannot detect the most common genetic defect during IVF, aneuploidy (i.e. chromosomal copy-number variation). Aneuploidy is linked to higher rates of miscarriage, and occurs more often in women >40 years of age; thus, aneuploidy has been a frequent target for genetic screening to improve IVF outcomes.  Pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) refers to a variety of techniques aimed at detecting changes in chromosomal copy number, with the goal of identifying high-quality euploid embryos for implantation. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it possible to screen embryos at higher levels of precision, and across a wider range of genetic defects, including mosaicism, triploidy and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite these remarkable advances, there are still significant challenges with PGT-A sequencing. Indeed, the most commonly implemented software for PGT-A (i.e. BlueFuse® ) are bundled with specific sequencing platforms (i.e. VeriSeq®), and are only designed to test for aneuploidy. Furthermore, existing pipelines are not user-friendly or customizable, which is a serious obstacle prohibiting the use of NGS by clinicians / embryologists. A more accessible bioinformatics platform is desperately needed that will bridge the gap between PGT-A sequencing and IVF outcomes.  Basepair™ is an innovator in efficient, user-friendly, web-based NGS analysis systems, with fully automated ChIP-, RNA-, ATAC-, and DNA-Seq bioinformatics pipelines available online. Here, Basepair will deliver PiNDA™, the first fully integrated software solution for comprehensive PGT-A analysis. In Aim 1, we will develop modules to test for specific chromosomal abnormalities, including mosaicism and triploidy, and validate each model with training data derived from somatic cell lines with known chromosomal aberrations. In Aim 2, we will integrate our modules into the PiNDA software system, creating a user-friendly, web-based interface that will perform full data analysis (raw data to full summary report) in <15 minutes, with no manual input required. Final data will be accessible via Basepair’s online portal, facilitating rapid data transfer from embryologists to physicians, and supporting the integration of NGS tests in IVF. Our innovative bioinformatics platform will accelerate NGS analysis for IVF, improving rates of pregnancy and advancing research in the success of IVF procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In vitro fertilization (IVF) methods have begun to leverage next-generation sequencing technologies for pre-implantation genetic testing of aneuploidy (PGT-A), expanding the array of chromosomal abnormalities that can be accurately detected. However, the vast majority of software can only distinguish one type of genetic defect (i.e. aneuploidy), are difficult to use, and are tied to distinct sequencing platforms, limiting the clinical utility of resulting analyses. Basepair™ Inc. is a pioneer in user-friendly, web-based bioinformatics pipelines, providing comprehensive services for a wide range of sequencing projects.

"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9752227,F30CA224687,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Relapse', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor Promoters', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States', 'Variant', 'X Inactivation', 'anticancer research', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'simulation', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,30926,-0.0007927279268122781
"Flexible multivariate models for linking multi-scale connectome and genome data in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders Project Summary/Abstract  In the field of Alzheimer’s and related disorder, there has been very little work focusing on imaging genomics biomarker approaches, despite considerable promise. In part this is due to the fact that most studies have fo- cused on candidate gene approaches or those that do not capitalize on capturing (and amplifying) small effects spread across many sites. Even for genome wide studies, the vast majority of imaging genomic studies still rely on massive univariate analyses. The use of multivariate approaches provides a powerful tool for analyzing the data in the context of genomic and connectomic networks (i.e. weighted combinations of voxels and genetic variables). It is clear that imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. Multivariate data fusion models that have been proposed to date typically suffer from two key limitations: 1) they require the data dimensionality to match (i.e. 4D fMRI data has to be reduced to 1D to match with the 1D genomic data, and 2) models typically assume linear relationships despite evidence of non- linearity in brain imaging and genomic data. New methods are needed that can handle data that has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. Secondly, methods that can handle complex relationships, such as groups of networks that are tightly coupled or nonlinear relationships in the data. To ad- dress these challenges, we introduce a new framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can auto- matically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large longitudinal dataset of individuals at various stages of cognitive impair- ment and dementia. Using follow-up outcomes data we will evaluate the predictive accuracy of a joint analysis compared to a unimodal analysis, as well as its ability to characterize various clinical subtypes including those driven by vascular effects including subcortical ischemic vascular dementia versus those that are more neuro- degenerative. We will evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to max- imize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data promises to advance our understanding of Alzheimer’s and related disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. 3 Project Narrative  It is clear that multimodal data fusion provides benefits over unimodal analysis, however existing approaches typically require the data to have matched dimensionality, leading to a loss of information. In addition, most models assume linear relationships, despite strong evidence of nonlinear relationships in the data. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture multi-scale brain imaging and genomics data which we will use to study a large data set of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related disorders. 2",Flexible multivariate models for linking multi-scale connectome and genome data in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders,9826772,RF1AG063153,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical subtypes', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'longitudinal dataset', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'statistics', 'structural genomics', 'subcortical ischemic vascular disease', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'white matter damage']",NIA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,RF1,2019,3319889,-0.052891933637058304
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.

"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9751202,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer transplantation', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2019,545099,-0.017567352440436532
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome,9773075,RC2DK118619,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bile duct carcinoma', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'High Performance Computing', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Disease', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Network-based', 'Norway', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical database', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'pollutant', 'primary outcome', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,RC2,2019,1566059,-0.005859980471746896
"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk. Insights gained from this research will inform prediction, prevention, intervention, and treatment efforts by clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying SZ symptoms.",Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia,9644559,K01MH109765,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alleles', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'classification trees', 'clinical risk', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'density', 'differential expression', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'gene function', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'marijuana use', 'mind control', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'population stratification', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'regression trees', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'severe mental illness', 'sex', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trait', 'translational research program', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2019,176985,-0.007396338569935074
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9788096,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,528837,-0.0025453620595034137
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults. The relevance of the project to public health is reflected in the long-term goal, which is to construct a genetic risk profile which can be used by health-care providers and educators to identify individuals genetically at risk for chronic tinnitus.",Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,9655203,R21DC016704,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Audiology', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Hyperacusis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrial Arts', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Otitis Media', 'PTGS1 gene', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Tinnitus', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'college', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hearing impairment', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'relating to nervous system', 'serotonin receptor', 'serotonin transporter', 'sound', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'voltage gated channel', 'young adult']",NIDCD,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,151994,-0.011975850716111949
"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9618151,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction model', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,628904,-0.016977622824497714
"Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, damage and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies visual field loss. However, a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous and it represents a family of age-related disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic networks. We propose to continue to use the BXD (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J) family of recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice as a genetic reference panel (GRP) and to combine our work with human genome wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover and clarify the genetic heterogeneity that underlies optic nerve (ON) damage. We have had recent success using this combined approach in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). We are very well positioned to take the next step and apply this approach to define cellular targets of RGC damage and death. We propose to uncover phenotypic diversities of glaucoma-related ON damage and uncover common underlying mechanisms that are shared with IOP modulation. Our long-term research goal is to identify disease mechanisms and develop neuroprotective therapies to preserve retinal health in patients at risk for glaucoma. Our overall objective is to identify novel gene products and related mechanisms that lead to glaucomatous endophenotypes using multi-dimensional genetic analyses, cross-species comparisons (mouse, rat and human) and validation using novel murine glaucoma models. Our central hypothesis is that molecular processes leading to glaucoma associated-endophenotypes, such as elevated IOP and ON damage, are shared across species, and that species comparisons can uncover common underlying mechanisms, and efficient testing of targeted glaucoma therapeutics. In the current investigation, we perform a systematic analysis of ON damage, and an additional species—rat. We will mine the extensive databases of IOP and ON damage that we are generating for more than 70 BXD strains across five age cohorts with the goal of defining new models of glaucoma. An overall strength of this proposal is the combination of cutting-edge systems genetics methods, species comparisons of glaucoma phenotypes, and a strong interdisciplinary team that includes investigators with extensive experience in systems genetics, glaucoma, GWAS in human and rats, and advanced computational methods. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following thress studies: 1) Identify the candidate gene on chromosome 12 that modulates ON damage; 2) Determine if modulation of IOP and/or ON damage is shared across rodent species; and 3) Identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models through a comprehensive analysis of our enlarged BXD GRP of 100 or more BXD strains. The outcomes of these studies will define novel genes and molecular networks that underlie glaucoma-associated phenotypes and also provide unique glaucoma models for future analysis. These results are expected to fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous, and it likely represents a family of disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic pathways.

"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9752596,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,323659,-0.017293260777339236
"Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease Ray PA-16-162 Project Summary Eczema is a chronic skin inflammatory disease infecting 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults and increasing. Researchers have struggled to understand the genetic and environmental factors that appear to play a role in eczema's increasing prevalence. The majority of current studies focus on one or two specific types of Genome-wide data in association with eczema such as SNPS, DNA methylation levels, or gene expression levels. Current statistical methods have forced this limitation as none exist, to our knowledge that allow clustering of subjects across multi-dimensional and multi-faceted variables. Therefore, in this project we aim to introduce a novel clustering approach that will cluster subjects across genes which contain SNP information, DNA methylation levels, and gene expression levels. Summarized clusters will then tested for associated risk of eczema or any allergic disease. Genetic patterns associated with eczema will then be further explored to better identify the behavior genetic data and it's uniqueness. The method will be built in R Gui as a free downloadable package making it accessible and easy to use. We will apply the proposed method to the third generation Isle of Wight cohort data. The third generation cohort data consist of children born (2010-current time) from the original cohort of children born between 1989 and 1990 on the Isle of Wight in the UK and contains Genome-wide datasets, disease and exposure status, and allergy information across multiple follow-ups. The implications of this study not only impact the statistical field with a new clustering approach but the eczema and allergy field as well as no other studies have been able to analyze three Genome-wide datasets in concert associated with the risk of allergic diseases. Ray PA-16-162 Project Narrative The prevalence of eczema is increasing world-wide and infecting between 10-30% of children. The complete underlying cause of eczema is unknown but thought to be mixture of genetic and environmental factors. This project aims to incorporate genetic and epigenetic data in concert using a novel statistical approach in hopes of identifying patterns associated with eczema risk, allowing researchers to better understand the biological mechanisms.",Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease,9629655,R03AI128227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allergic Disease', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eczema', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic inflammatory skin', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infancy', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'screening', 'unsupervised learning', 'user-friendly', 'vector']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R03,2019,69485,0.01337233242806605
"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9894990,U01HG008657,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'education resources', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'online resource', 'outreach', 'patient portal', 'polyposis', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2019,707923,0.003991731947155501
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9649188,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'exercise intervention', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual response', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2019,2593647,-0.008047331960925752
"lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data PROJECT SUMMARY The onset of most human disease involves numerous molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway, and treatment contexts. This system is probed by thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, and integrative analysis of these data can generate testable hypotheses identifying causal genetic variants and linking them to network level changes in cells to disease phenotypes. This can enable deeper molecular-level understanding of pathophysiology, paving the way to genome-based precision medicine.  The long term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through integrative analysis of high- throughput biological data in a disease context. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration methods, created algorithms for the prediction of disease genes through context-specific and mechanistic network models and analysis of quantitative genetics data, and made novel insights into important biological processes and diseases. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by building public interactive systems capable of real-time user-driven integration that are popular among experimental biologists.  We now propose to connect these gene-level functional network approaches with the underlying genomic variation by deciphering how genomic variants lead to specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. We propose to develop ab initio sequence-level models capable of predicting biochemical effects of any genomic variant (including rare or never observed) on chromatin state and RNA regulation, then link these effects with gene-level regulatory consequences (including tissue-specific transcription and RNA splicing), and finally put genomic sequence directly into the network context via a statistical approach for detecting genes and network neighborhoods with a significantly elevated mutational burden in disease. Our key deliverable will be a user- friendly, interactive web-based framework enabling systems-level variant impact analysis in a network context and an open source library for computational scientists. In addition to systematic analysis across contexts and diseases, we will collaborate with experimentalists to apply our methods to Alzheimer’s, autism spectrum disorders, chronic kidney disease, immune diseases, and congenital heart defects as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to directly contribute to better understanding of these diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE To pave the way for mechanistic interpretation of disease in the genomic context and eventually, precision medicine, we will develop algorithms for de novo prediction of functional biochemical effects of noncoding variants at the DNA regulation and RNA processing levels and then build frameworks for sequence-based prediction of tissue-specific transcription and post-transcriptional RNA processes (starting with splicing). To facilitate discovery of disease mechanisms, we will develop approaches for analyzing these variant effects in a network context, including those developed in the previous grant period (mechanistic and functional networks) and novel network models that integrate exon usage information or enhancer-gene interactions. In addition to verifying top predictions experimentally in our group or by our collaborators in case study areas of neurodegenerative disease, chronic kidney disease, ASD, and congenital heart disease, we will make our methods available to the broader biomedical community through public, interactive user interfaces and open source libraries.",lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9740445,R01GM071966,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histones', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Imagery', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunology', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'congenital heart disorder', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,440312,-0.01903798249002152
"Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) – comprising the endocannabinoids, their G-protein coupled re- ceptors, and their metabolic enzymes – is one of the most important physiological systems involved in estab- lishing and maintaining human health. In some illnesses, ECS dysregulation is an element of disease pathol- ogy whereas in others it is believed to be protective. Thus, there is intense interest in developing pharma- cotherapies that target the ECS to blunt its pathologies or harness its protective effects. One of the main challenges in developing new drugs that target the ECS is the problem of side effects, con- sistent with the nearly ubiquitous expression of this signaling system. Current efforts to increase the functional specificity of ECS drugs include preventing them from crossing the blood brain barrier, and targeting ancillary ECS proteins which modulate principal ECS components without being direct effectors themselves. Until now, discovery of ancillary proteins has proceeded mainly by inference from prior knowledge obtained from isolated cells. This approach can be limiting because knowledge of the underlying genetic and biochemical networks is usually incomplete. Here we propose to develop new high-throughput methodologies to enable the first unbi- ased genetic screens to identify new ECS molecules in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is an omnivorous bacterivore but it learns to prefer some species of bacteria more than others. We recently discovered that one of the worm's endocannabinoids increases the worm’s appetite for favored foods over less favored foods, a phenomenon called hedonic amplification. We propose this system as a genetically tractable model of cannabinoid effects on appetitive behavior, providing an easily screenable phenotype that directly corresponds to a well-known human behavior. The research develops two high-throughput microfluidic systems for quantifying hedonic amplification in C. ele- gans. The systems are then utilized to perform two small-scale genetic screens as a prelude to future large- scale screens. In the first, hedonic amplification will be quantified in strains in which homologs of known mam- malian ECS components have been knocked out; this screen further validates the C. elegans ECS as a mam- malian model. In the second screen, hedonic amplification will be assessed in a select set of wild isolate strains of C. elegans to estimate the heritability of this phenotype. The research is significant because it could ultimately lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to mitigate disease and promote health. Cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms involving endocannabinoids are involved in numerous physiological and psy- chological conditions including nausea, obesity, pain, anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and neu- rodegenerative disease where they can be part of the disease or the body's protective response to it. However, most attempts to harness the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid signaling have been stymied by prob- lematic side effects. The proposed research develops and applies innovative methods to screen for genes en- coding new members of the endocannabinoid signaling system as potential drug targets for treatment of endo- cannabinoid-related diseases, with fewer and milder side effects.",Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans,9650393,R21DA047645,"['Action Potentials', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cells', 'Chemotaxis', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzymes', 'Fire - disasters', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'Mutagenesis', 'Names', 'Nausea', 'Nematoda', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obesity', 'Operating System', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Organ', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'anandamide', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'endocannabinoid signaling', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'feeding', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic strain', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hedonic', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function mutation', 'marijuana use disorder', 'member', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2019,220842,-0.013598651320382753
"Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats Project Summary (Overall)  The purpose of this renewal application is to continue the successful activities of our center, which uses quantitative genetic techniques to study the genetic basis of drug abuse-related behaviors in outbred rats. When our center was initially funded in June 2014, our goal was to develop outbred N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as a platform for genetic studies of behaviors that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. The first four years of funding have allowed us to establish a vibrant community of investigators using HS rats to study drug abuse and other traits, which we refer to as an ecosystem. This ecosystem includes both the investigators who are directly involved in this renewal application and many others who have obtained separate funding, some from NIDA, and some from other sources. The growth of this ecosystem reflects one of the ways that our center has served as national resource. We are proposing three projects that involved phenotyping HS rats for a variety of traits, including intravenous cocaine and nicotine self-administration, response to novelty, social behavior, reaction time, and delay discounting. Two of those projects are continuations from the prior funding period and are designed to increase our sample size from 1,600 to 3,200 rats per phenotype. We present data showing that such an increase produces an exponential increase in the number of significant findings. This approach parallels human genetics studies of SUD, which have also benefited tremendously from larger sample sizes. We will use these data to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a suite of related techniques. In addition, we will measure gene expression in behaviorally naïve rats using RNASeq and use those data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate GWAS and eQTL data in an effort to identify specific genes that influence the behavioral phenotypes. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also study genetic correlations, perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) and explore a novel strategy called polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS), that is intended to allow translation of polygenic signals across species. Project 4 will use a network-based approach to extend our GWAS to account for known biological networks. This proposed renewal also includes a pilot project core to support new directions and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. Finally we propose an administrative core that supports many activities of the center, including educational, career development and public outreach. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genes in a range of psychologically complex behaviors and will provide novel biological insights that may support future efforts at preventing or treating drug abuse. Project Narrative (Overall)  Using powerful genetic, molecular and statistical techniques, we will study the genetic basis of traits that have well-established relevance to drug abuse. We expect that these studies will enhance our understanding of drug abuse and lead to the identification of specific genes and pathways. These discoveries will improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to drug abuse in humans and may identify new opportunities to treat psychiatric disorders including but not limited to addiction.",Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats,9793600,P50DA037844,"['Adolescent', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crime', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Esthesia', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Individual', 'Intravenous', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Network-based', 'Nicotine', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Self Administration', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Reinforcement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'discount', 'discounting', 'drug abuse related behavior', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'premature', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P50,2019,2949105,-0.013757731554242446
"Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rare monogenic forms of common diseases have provided key fundamental insights about common disease. However, genetic, environmental, and stochastic elements influence risk for disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder afflicting 1 in 250 linked to severe increases in LDL cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, is an ideal model to characterize modifiers of disease. Despite the presence of a strong genetic driver of hypercholesterolemia from FH mutations, we recently observed that half do not have the expected severe hypercholesterolemia. In this proposal, we outline several methods to discover and dissect the genetic and non-genetic factors influencing CHD risk conferred by FH mutations in humans and determine whether knowledge of these factors can improve risk discrimination among those with FH mutations. Our approach harnesses several multi-dimensional datasets: whole genome sequences, metabolomics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will aggregate and curate 75,000 deep (30X) whole genome sequences and cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will discover genetic and non-genetic modifiers of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk in FH and evaluate their metabolomic consequences. In Aim 3, we will develop a method incorporating genetics and longitudinal non- genetic exposures for CHD risk stratification among ~4,000 with FH mutations in the Million Veteran Program. In addition to the proposed Aims, this five-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's (PI's) scientific and professional development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The research strategy builds upon the PI's prior research experience and clinical training. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and master's degree in Biomedical Informatics, he completed post- graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Medicine. He recently developed a new preventive/genetic cardiology clinic focusing on the evaluation and management of those with or a family history of premature CHD, including those with FH, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills in human genetics and genomics into new domains: integrative genomics, statistical genetics, clinical informatics, and risk modeling. The career development goals will be at achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentorship, collaboration, didactic coursework, conferences, and scientific investigation. This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of MGH and the Broad Institute. Successful completion of this career development award will result in improved fundamental understanding of the determinants of CHD, result in the PI's transition to an independent physician-scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for R01-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cardiovascular disease, largely due to coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death in the United States and now worldwide despite current advances. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a relative common genetic disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and premature CHD but many carrying these mutations do not develop these consequences.

"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. The computational tools stemming from this research will enable efficient and accurate inference under complex population genetic models, thereby broadly facilitating research efforts to understand the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk.",Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics,9552183,R01GM094402,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'STEM research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic selection', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'open source', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,297725,0.0001475827582525271
"Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms Project Summary The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven valuable as a model for many high-impact medical conditions. The strength of C. elegans derives from the extensive homologies between human and nematode genes (60-80%) and the many powerful tools available to manipulate genes in C. elegans, including expressing human genes. Researchers utilizing medical models based on C. elegans have converged on two main quantifiable measures of health and disease: locomotion and feeding; the latter is the focus of this proposal. C. elegans feeds on bacteria ingested through the pharynx, a rhythmic muscular pump in the worm’s throat. Alterations in pharyngeal activity are a sensitive indicator of dysfunction in muscles and neurons, as well as the animal’s overall health and metabolic state. C. elegans neurobiologists have long recognized the utility of the elec- tropharyngeogram (EPG), a non-invasive, whole-body electrical recording analogous to an electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides a quantitative readout of feeding. However, technical barriers associated with whole- animal electrophysiology have limited its adoption to fewer than fifteen laboratories world-wide. NemaMetrix Inc. surmounted these barriers by developing a turn-key, microfluidic system for EPG acquisition and analysis called the the ScreenChip platform. The proposed research and commercialization activities significantly expand the capabilities of the ScreenChip platform in two key respects. First, they enlarge the phenotyping capabilities of the platform by incorporating high-speed video of whole animal and pharyngeal movements. Second they develop a cloud database compatible with Gene Ontology, Open Biomedical Ontologies and Worm Ontology standards, allowing data-mining of combined electrophysiological, imaging and other data modalities. The machine-readable database will be compatible with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. It will be accessible to all researchers to enable discovery of relationships between genotypes, phenotypes and treatments using large-scale analysis of multidimensional phenotypic profiles. The research and commercialization efforts culminate in an unprecedented integration of genetic, cellular, and organismal levels of analysis, with minimal training and effort required by users. Going forward, we envision the PheNom platform as a gold standard for medical research using C. elegans. n/a",Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms,9467327,R44GM119906,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Feeds', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Pump', 'Readability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Microscopy', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'commercialization', 'data mining', 'design', 'feeding', 'human disease', 'human model', 'member', 'phenotypic data', 'prevent', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'web app']",NIGMS,"NEMAMETRIX, INC.",R44,2018,510448,0.004939150261200695
"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed un- derstanding of admixture is essential for e ective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on pheno- type are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simpli ed models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This pro- posal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to lever- age this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate power- ful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as e ectively as homogeneous populations. The rst step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statis- tical framework to infer ne-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop e ective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major im- pact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to eciently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human pheno- types, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on ne-scale genomic struc- ture and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can bene t from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,9547454,R35GM125055,"['Admixture', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic evolution', 'insight', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2018,332952,0.006555270957350507
"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9458167,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'clinical biomarkers', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-doctoral', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2018,21727,0.029967395992051494
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efﬁciently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be inﬁnitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic refer- ence population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, ﬂies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions consid- ered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and ﬁnd variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and ex- pansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered in- clude: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only ﬁll signiﬁcant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientiﬁc output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9485688,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2018,336445,-0.00862045791473389
"Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks The goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods that will identify genes driving epistasis between quantitative trait loci. Genetic association studies in both humans and model organisms have been increasingly able to detect interactions among genetic variants that influence disease risk and pathogenesis. However, identifying which genes are represented by individual variants is a major challenge. Many variants influencing disease are situated between genes, and even those that are in genes may be representing an effect from a neighboring gene. In model organism studies the situation is even more problematic. In breeding experiments, genetic associations with phenotypes typically encompass large regions of DNA with many genes, and experimental follow-up to identify the genes responsible for the association is resource-intensive. To address this problem, we are developing computational tools to prioritize putative gene interactions in interacting genomic regions for biological follow-up. We use machine learning classifiers trained on functional gene-gene interaction networks and combinatorial optimization to identify likely candidate gene-gene interactions responsible for epistatic interactions between genomic regions. Our methods sift through enormous spaces of candidate interactions, retaining only those whose functional interactions identify as plausible for supporting the epistatic interaction. These tools hold promise to dramatically limit the resource-intensity of biological follow up of putative epistasis and to clarify the genetic architecture of complex disease. Genetic studies in humans and model organisms are critical to understanding how genes interact to influence disease. Standard association studies, however, do not identify individual genes, but rather large genetic regions containing many genes, and determining individual genes responsible for phenotypic effects requires resource-intensive biological follow-up experiments. We are developing computational methods to prioritize genes in these regions for biological follow-up, with the ultimate goal of speeding the discovery of novel roles of genes in disease.",Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks,9528022,R21LM012615,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Breeding', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic study', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lower Organism', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2018,200175,-0.03299758868706389
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9515964,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2018,341899,-0.03785684534417035
"Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Title: Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Project Summary  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. Risk assessment of influenza viruses is a key component in pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP), and it can help optimize resources for influenza surveillance, vaccine development and other control measurements to help minimize losses due to an emerging influenza virus. Risk assessment of influenza viruses includes emergence risk and public health impact of novel influenza viruses. Emergence risk assesses the probability for a novel influenza virus to infect and easily spread among humans; it is the first risk to be evaluated in risk assessment.  Although a number of individual mutations or structural/functional motifs have been reported to be associated with influenza infection and transmission, their effects on emergence risk are difficult to predict a priori. Thus, conventional methods for assessment of the emergence risk of a novel IAV often require laboratory generation of reassortants and subsequent measurement of their infectivity, pathogenesis, and transmission, which is often done in a mammalian system. However, this strategy can lead to laboratory mutants with gain of function (i.e., mutants with new or enhanced activity on pathogenesis and/or transmissibility in mammals). Thus, an ideal system for influenza risk assessment should be able to quantify emergence risk for a novel IAV solely by using genomic sequences.  Avian influenza A viruses facilitated the emergence of all four known pandemic human influenza A viruses: the hemagglutinin genes of 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic viruses are all of avian origin, and the polymerase PB2 and PA genes of the 2009 pandemic virus are of avian origin. Risk assessment of potential reassortants from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses has been a key component of the pandemic influenza preparedness process.  The objectives of this study are to develop and validate a machine learning method to assess the emergence risk for a novel IAV using genomic sequences. The study will focus on emergence risk from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses. We expect to identify genetic features within and across gene segments and ascertain their synergistic effects as emergence risk determinants. We also expect to develop a computational model for estimating the probability of a possible reassortant to emerge, given the genomic sequences of one human influenza virus and one avian influenza virus. The study results should help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and with assessing emergence risk of influenza virus; thus, the results should facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness. Project Narrative This project will develop a computational model for influenza risk assessment, and it will help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and for assessing the emergence risk of influenza viruses, and thus the project will facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness.",Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses,9599007,R21AI135820,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Birds', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Funding', 'Gene Combinations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Reassortant Viruses', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'cost', 'enzootic', 'flu transmission', 'gain of function', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic influenza', 'transmission process', 'vaccine development', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,181875,-0.024152209737662873
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9543532,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,400001,-0.018884100189377643
"Identification of gene-gene interactions in relation to risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is an often lethal cancer and a significant public health concern in the U.S. Several risk factors have been identified for EA and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE), including symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), central adiposity, smoking, male sex, and European ancestry, but our understanding of the molecular/genetic determinants that govern why most people with reflux never develop BE, and most with BE never progress to EA, remains limited. Inherited genetics represents another likely contributor to disease susceptibility, and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) within the Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON) have identified multiple novel germline genetic variants associated with altered risk of BE/EA. As observed for other cancers and complex diseases, however, the majority of estimated heritability for BE and EA appears unexplained. One plausible source for this “missing heritability” lies in the joint effects of multiple loci acting in combination. We seek to identify novel gene-gene interactions (G×G) in relation to risk of BE/EA, using a novel fusion of advanced analytical approaches aimed at overcoming technical limitations often encountered in the conduct of large-scale G×G (e.g. computational complexity and low statistical power). In a discovery scan (Aim 1), we initially will use two complementary knowledge-guided filtering methods to reduce the dimensionality of the G×G search space: first, we select ~500 genes with known or hypothesized relationships to BE/EA etiology and pathogenesis based on findings from GWAS, TCGA, and related studies; second, we select ~50,000 gene-gene pairs with highest-likelihood annotated biological relationships based on an integrated knowledge resource of pathways, processes, and interactions (Biofiler). Using existing germline genetic data on 2515 EA patients, 3295 BE patients, and 3207 controls from BEACON, we next will adopt a recently-described `hierarchical group-lasso' machine learning framework to select, in a joint model, ~1000 candidate pairwise SNP-SNP interactions most predictive of case status. These interactions are then evaluated using an independent validation dataset of 1609 EA cases, 1037 BE cases, and 3537 controls (Aim 2), using standard logistic regression models. In exploratory work, we will perform stratified analyses by sex or smoking history. The proposed studies are anticipated to expand our basic understanding of key biological pathways and mechanisms underlying the emergence of BE/EA; generate new leads and possible candidate targets for interventional strategies; and expand the foundation for future collaborative initiatives to integrate genetic, epidemiologic, and clinical data into robust disease models and novel predictive tools for BE/EA risk assessment and precision prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is an often lethal cancer that represents a significant public health burden in the U.S. In this proposal, we capitalize on the availability of large-scale existing datasets derived from expensive multi-year international collaborations, and perform new analyses to improve our understanding of how inherited gene variants interact to influence susceptibility to EA and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE). Findings from this study will expand our basic understanding of key biological pathways underlying this cancer and ultimately help advance the development of better strategies for prevention and treatment.",Identification of gene-gene interactions in relation to risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus,9590939,R03CA223731,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Inherited', 'Intercept', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Life Style', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metaplastic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Target', 'Obesity', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reflux', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically actionable', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R03,2018,93591,-0.02402951865327186
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9547382,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiota', 'human microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolomics', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota transplantation', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'stool sample', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,634157,-0.009794706519300943
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician. As applied to the three case study areas, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders, our system has the potential to identify novel disease genes and pathways and to enable development of better diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and, in the longer term, treatments.",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9415436,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Imagery', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Update', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,445349,0.011546919416021283
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community.

"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear. This project focuses on building new flexible, data-adaptive tools to translate this wealth of low level information into actionable discoveries, and actual biological understanding.",Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics,9559432,DP5OD019820,"['Address', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polynomial Models', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'convict', 'data to knowledge', 'flexibility', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP5,2018,325325,0.02079375863025908
"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared. Finally, an exploratory aim will use the PRS scores from the PGC data to generate risk scores in the lab sample to examine if there is a genetic association with conditioning deficits.  To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals. These goals will incorporate training in the epidemiology and genetics of AUD and PTSD, molecular and statistical genetics techniques, and conduct of clinical laboratory paradigms using genetic and psychophysiological measures. This training and resultant findings will capitalize on existing expertise and provide additional, focused training to allow for the development of a multimodal research program that uses large-scale genetic association findings to develop mechanism-focused laboratory studies that inform upon the development and maintenance of this complex presentation. The proposed research represents an important contribution towards advancing our understanding of the complicated and frequently comorbid phenotypes of AUD and PTSD. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing an independent research line that ultimately aims to decrease the burden of alcohol-related problems, consistent with NIAAA research priority. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur, and some of the genetic risk for these conditions is shared. This project aims to elucidate the shared molecular genetic risk and examine potential learning-based mechanisms common to both disorders, by linking large-scale genome-wide data with a clinical laboratory study. This K01 award will provide the candidate with the training necessary to pursue a multimodal program of research that aims to synthesize genetically informed research with laboratory studies of mechanism to inform upon the shared underpinnings of AUD and PTSD and advance work aimed at improving prevention and treatment efforts.",Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder,9445540,K01AA025692,"['Address', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Twin Studies', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular scale', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'psychogenetics', 'responsible alcohol use', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'trait', 'trauma exposure']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,177833,-0.04570604630240357
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9568024,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2018,4132864,-0.00915549599098751
"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9611428,F30CA224687,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Relapse', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor Promoters', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States', 'Variant', 'X Inactivation', 'anticancer research', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'simulation', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,30434,-0.0007927279268122781
"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide.

"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets. We will address these major problems with current genetic toxicity assays by developing new methods and associated commercial assay kits.",Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity,9465735,R44ES029014,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aneugens', 'Antioxidants', 'Appearance', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Bleomycin', 'Caspase', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Colcemid', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-PKcs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Epitopes', 'Etoposide', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'GADD45A gene', 'Gamma-H2AX', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'NF-kappa B', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Stains', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'clastogen', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genotoxicity', 'hazard', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'next generation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'repaired', 'response', 'targeted agent', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2018,178854,0.002747911012300485
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA.

"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through this application GHS seeks to continue its participation in the eMERGE Network for Phase III - Study Investigators U01 (RFA-HG-14-025) funding opportunity. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery and validation of gene-phenotype associations; 2) develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice; develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results",EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics,9515974,U01HG008679,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'County', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Economic Models', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Familial disease', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'Safety', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'case finding', 'chronic rhinosinusitis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genotyped patients', 'implementation research', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized health care', 'phase 3 study', 'phenome', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational genomics', 'treatment response']",NHGRI,GEISINGER CLINIC,U01,2018,871212,0.003534311497919786
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9536694,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'combat', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2018,570554,-0.017567352440436532
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome,9592939,RC2DK118619,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bile duct carcinoma', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'High Performance Computing', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Network-based', 'Norway', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'pollutant', 'primary outcome', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'tool', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,RC2,2018,1622560,-0.005859980471746896
"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk. Insights gained from this research will inform prediction, prevention, intervention, and treatment efforts by clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying SZ symptoms.",Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia,9429123,K01MH109765,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alleles', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'density', 'differential expression', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'gene function', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'marijuana use', 'mind control', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'population stratification', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'severe mental illness', 'sex', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trait', 'translational research program', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2018,178674,-0.007396338569935074
"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern.

"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9407289,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'routine care', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,674450,-0.016977622824497714
"Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rare monogenic forms of common diseases have provided key fundamental insights about common disease. However, genetic, environmental, and stochastic elements influence risk for disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder afflicting 1 in 250 linked to severe increases in LDL cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, is an ideal model to characterize modifiers of disease. Despite the presence of a strong genetic driver of hypercholesterolemia from FH mutations, we recently observed that half do not have the expected severe hypercholesterolemia. In this proposal, we outline several methods to discover and dissect the genetic and non-genetic factors influencing CHD risk conferred by FH mutations in humans and determine whether knowledge of these factors can improve risk discrimination among those with FH mutations. Our approach harnesses several multi-dimensional datasets: whole genome sequences, metabolomics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will aggregate and curate 75,000 deep (30X) whole genome sequences and cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will discover genetic and non-genetic modifiers of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk in FH and evaluate their metabolomic consequences. In Aim 3, we will develop a method incorporating genetics and longitudinal non- genetic exposures for CHD risk stratification among ~4,000 with FH mutations in the Million Veteran Program. In addition to the proposed Aims, this five-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's (PI's) scientific and professional development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The research strategy builds upon the PI's prior research experience and clinical training. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and master's degree in Biomedical Informatics, he completed post- graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Medicine. He recently developed a new preventive/genetic cardiology clinic focusing on the evaluation and management of those with or a family history of premature CHD, including those with FH, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills in human genetics and genomics into new domains: integrative genomics, statistical genetics, clinical informatics, and risk modeling. The career development goals will be at achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentorship, collaboration, didactic coursework, conferences, and scientific investigation. This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of MGH and the Broad Institute. Successful completion of this career development award will result in improved fundamental understanding of the determinants of CHD, result in the PI's transition to an independent physician-scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for R01-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cardiovascular disease, largely due to coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death in the United States and now worldwide despite current advances. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a relative common genetic disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and premature CHD but many carrying these mutations do not develop these consequences. This proposal seeks to define and characterize the factors modifying CHD risk among those with FH mutations; success has the potential to broadly identify new mechanisms of CHD and novel strategies for prevention.",Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model,9431712,K08HL140203,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Amish', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Biochemical', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'heart disease risk', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'metabolomics', 'next generation', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2018,173296,-0.014817043711708128
"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9535429,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,315184,-0.017293260777339236
"Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease Ray PA-16-162 Project Summary Eczema is a chronic skin inflammatory disease infecting 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults and increasing. Researchers have struggled to understand the genetic and environmental factors that appear to play a role in eczema's increasing prevalence. The majority of current studies focus on one or two specific types of Genome-wide data in association with eczema such as SNPS, DNA methylation levels, or gene expression levels. Current statistical methods have forced this limitation as none exist, to our knowledge that allow clustering of subjects across multi-dimensional and multi-faceted variables. Therefore, in this project we aim to introduce a novel clustering approach that will cluster subjects across genes which contain SNP information, DNA methylation levels, and gene expression levels. Summarized clusters will then tested for associated risk of eczema or any allergic disease. Genetic patterns associated with eczema will then be further explored to better identify the behavior genetic data and it's uniqueness. The method will be built in R Gui as a free downloadable package making it accessible and easy to use. We will apply the proposed method to the third generation Isle of Wight cohort data. The third generation cohort data consist of children born (2010-current time) from the original cohort of children born between 1989 and 1990 on the Isle of Wight in the UK and contains Genome-wide datasets, disease and exposure status, and allergy information across multiple follow-ups. The implications of this study not only impact the statistical field with a new clustering approach but the eczema and allergy field as well as no other studies have been able to analyze three Genome-wide datasets in concert associated with the risk of allergic diseases. Ray PA-16-162 Project Narrative The prevalence of eczema is increasing world-wide and infecting between 10-30% of children. The complete underlying cause of eczema is unknown but thought to be mixture of genetic and environmental factors. This project aims to incorporate genetic and epigenetic data in concert using a novel statistical approach in hopes of identifying patterns associated with eczema risk, allowing researchers to better understand the biological mechanisms.",Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease,9456064,R03AI128227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allergic Disease', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eczema', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic inflammatory skin', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infancy', 'novel', 'screening', 'unsupervised learning', 'user-friendly', 'vector']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R03,2018,69617,0.01337233242806605
"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity.

"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system.

"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG.

"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. The computational tools stemming from this research will enable efficient and accurate inference under complex population genetic models, thereby broadly facilitating research efforts to understand the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk.",Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics,9328097,R01GM094402,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'STEM research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic selection', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'open source', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,298655,0.0001475827582525271
"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed un- derstanding of admixture is essential for e ective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on pheno- type are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simpli ed models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This pro- posal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to lever- age this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate power- ful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as e ectively as homogeneous populations. The rst step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statis- tical framework to infer ne-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop e ective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major im- pact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to eciently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human pheno- types, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on ne-scale genomic struc- ture and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can bene t from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,9382936,R35GM125055,"['Admixture', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'insight', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2017,225087,0.006555270957350507
"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9240483,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'clinical biomarkers', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-doctoral', 'public health relevance', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2017,39597,0.029967395992051494
"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1. Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,9306198,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2017,352350,-0.01046581845391277
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9287487,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2017,367055,-0.03785684534417035
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9353372,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota transplantation', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,650808,-0.009794706519300943
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data.

While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician. As applied to the three case study areas, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders, our system has the potential to identify novel disease genes and pathways and to enable development of better diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and, in the longer term, treatments.",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9266422,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Imagery', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Update', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,445349,0.011546919416021283
"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear. We propose a novel computational method that links mechanistically the genetic variability to disease risk and apply it to a range of mental disorder studies to provide more biological insights and enable discovery of potential targets for drug development.","Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect",9301667,R01MH107666,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Architecture', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'molecular phenotype', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phenotypic data', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'user friendly software', 'web app', 'whole genome']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2017,430578,-0.036398830279676934
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies. This PheWAS proposal will develop new methods to identify detailed phenotypes and diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations,9332465,R01LM010685,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Catalogs', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'rare variant', 'tool', 'trait']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,458957,-0.02182778900734035
"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study? (3) How to accurately capture possible interactions between multiple genetic factors and their joint contribution to phenotypic variation? In particular, we will develop data structures and efficient algorithms for accurate and robust significance assessment that account for local population structure and joint effect of multiple genetic factors.    The proposed computational tools will be integrated into software packages under common application framework adopted by the broad scientific community.

Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The PAGE study focuses on analysis of existing large samples of primarily non- European ancestry to broaden our understanding of the ethnic differences in the genetic basis of complex disease.

"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear. This project focuses on building new flexible, data-adaptive tools to translate this wealth of low level information into actionable discoveries, and actual biological understanding.",Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics,9349367,DP5OD019820,"['Address', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polynomial Models', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'convict', 'data to knowledge', 'flexibility', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP5,2017,326784,0.02079375863025908
"VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA This R21 application proposes to use a large cohort of schizophrenia and healthy control subjects (2415 subjects) from the GENUS Consortium to clarify morphometric and genetic aspects of the corpus callosum (CC) and the lateral ventricles (LV) in schizophrenia (SZ). Our preliminary data indicate that LV and CC volume abnormalities are correlated in SZ, and index global functioning. Although abnormalities of LV and CC are hallmark of SZ and appear together in neurodevelopmental syndromes, LV and CC have rarely been studied together in SZ. Genetically, LV and CC are highly correlated, nonetheless the specific genetic determinants of this relationship are currently unknown. Recently, the SZ associated genetic risk variant miR137 has been shown to associate with LV and whole brain diffusion abnormalities in SZ where the two measures correlate. MiR137 has also been associated with poor cognitive and high negative symptoms load SZ, characterized by poor global functioning. By employing the unprecedented power of the GENUS cohort we will be able to clarify what appears to be a convergence of neuroimaging, symptomatology, cognitive measures and genetics information of LV and CC, and their relationship in one single large population of SZ and HC. This study is expected to provide novel data on the junction between morphometric measures of the corpus callosum and the lateral ventricles, their genetic background and their relation with symptoms and cognition in SZ and to identify subgroups of SZ based on these variables. The long term ramification of this proposal is the identification of novel therapeutic targets, based on miR137. T herapeutics based on miRNA, like miR137, are already been used in phase I cancer clinical trials, a disease that like SZ is polygenic. Finally, our study will reveal new information on the genetics of SZ and its relationship to symptomatology and brain variables. The lateral ventricles and corpus callosum are genetically correlated, and are often abnormal in schizophrenia, nonetheless, the genetic determinants of their relationship in schizophrenia remains unknown. Accordingly, we will employ the largest known population of schizophrenia and healthy subjects available, which includes morphometric, functional, cognitive and genetic data (2514 subjects), where we will analyze abnormalities of the lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum, and their relationship in schizophrenia. Volumetric and diffusion data will be explored for association with one of the strongest SZ associated genetic risk variant, MIR137, and with other genes, also SZ associated and themselves regulated by MIR137 and the outcome will be the identification of schizophrenia subgroups for more targeted intervention.","VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA",9357709,R21MH109819,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caucasians', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Fiber', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Proxy', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'Variant', 'axonal degeneration', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'disability', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'lateral ventricle', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'symptomatology', 'tractography', 'trend']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R21,2017,190181,-0.010571975753317978
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9479556,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2017,4412707,-0.00915549599098751
"OMOP information model for eMERGE phenotyping ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data.

"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross and fine motor delay and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of `Ciliary localization' model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished work we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and genetic mapping on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 5] Developed methods to ultrastructurally interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion. The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining `discoverable' genes that when mutated lead to JSRD, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in any proven JSRD gene lead to collapse of the ciliary transition zone by correlating genetic mutations with ultrastructural ciliary defects. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations within a mechanistic framework, and a model that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development.

"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9213066,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'combat', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'killings', 'member', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2017,591721,-0.017567352440436532
"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk. Insights gained from this research will inform prediction, prevention, intervention, and treatment efforts by clarifying the biological mechanisms underlying SZ symptoms.        ",Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia,9243309,K01MH109765,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schizotypal Personality Disorder', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'density', 'differential expression', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'gene function', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'marijuana use', 'mind control', 'novel', 'population stratification', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'severe mental illness', 'sex', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trait', 'translational research program', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2017,158132,-0.007396338569935074
"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9237818,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'routine care', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,738377,-0.016977622824497714

Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9551116,U01HG008657,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Community of Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Libraries', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'online resource', 'outreach', 'polyposis', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2017,842722,0.003991731947155501
"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system. It has direct implications in many human diseases developmental and psychiatric diseases such as Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia.",Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening,9301591,R01GM088333,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Fill-It', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Inbreeding', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morphology', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'forward genetics', 'genetic approach', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'success', 'synaptogenesis', 'targeted treatment', 'technology development', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,305864,0.013414314685224893
"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9320861,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'insight', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phenomenological models', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2017,2548493,0.00159517969570159
"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. The computational tools stemming from this research will enable efficient and accurate inference under complex population genetic models, thereby broadly facilitating research efforts to understand the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk.",Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics,9145232,R01GM094402,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic selection', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'open source', 'pressure', 'stem', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2016,303092,0.0001475827582525271
"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis.

"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9038173,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'clinical biomarkers', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-doctoral', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2016,39129,0.029967395992051494
"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1. Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,9097781,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,352350,-0.01046581845391277
"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease. The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.",Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations,9126587,R01GM104125,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Inbreeding', 'Influentials', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'genetic resource', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'prospective', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,241086,-0.0017056383838743214
"Systems genetic and reverse phenotypic analysis of age and retirement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput genomic platforms have revealed a profound effect of age on gene expression and gene methylation levels. For example, our integromic analysis of multiple publicly available data sets have identified hundreds of age related genes that can be organized into network modules. These gene sets along with genes and pathways known from the vast literature on aging and longevity provide valuable candidates in allelic association studies of the health and well-being of older Americans. The rich longitudinal data set and the genome wide scans of DNA samples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provide a unique resource for evaluating the phenotypic effects of genetic variants underlying aging related genes, gene sets and for developing multivariable models that include behavioral, psychosocial, and genetic factors. This proposal aims to apply systems biologic and systems genetic methods for identifying gene sets based on existing gene expression, gene methylation, and multiple large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying these genes will then be related to health, cognitive, behavioral, and economic phenotypes using multivariable regression-, machine learning-, and weighted network analysis approaches. An iterative process between SNP and phenotype selection facilitates the definition of clinically and economically important phenotypes under genetic control (reverse phenotyping). The proposal will not only elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of retirement relevant phenotypes (cognitive functioning, psychosocial factors, and health related expenditures) but also lead to a phenotypic annotation of aging related genes and pathways. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: State of the art statistical, computational, and network approaches for integrating genomic data with the valuable phenotypic and genetic data provided by the Health and Retirement Study is expected to lead to the identification of genetic markers relevant for improving the lives of America's older adults.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9136115,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,662793,-0.009794706519300943
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician. As applied to the three case study areas, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders, our system has the potential to identify novel disease genes and pathways and to enable development of better diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and, in the longer term, treatments.",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9057057,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Imagery', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Update', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'research study', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,445349,0.011546919416021283
"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear. We propose a novel computational method that links mechanistically the genetic variability to disease risk and apply it to a range of mental disorder studies to provide more biological insights and enable discovery of potential targets for drug development.","Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect",9130902,R01MH107666,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Architecture', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'molecular phenotype', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'user friendly software', 'web app', 'whole genome']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2016,430578,-0.036398830279676934
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS).

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies.

"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study? (3) How to accurately capture possible interactions between multiple genetic factors and their joint contribution to phenotypic variation? In particular, we will develop data structures and efficient algorithms for accurate and robust significance assessment that account for local population structure and joint effect of multiple genetic factors.    The proposed computational tools will be integrated into software packages under common application framework adopted by the broad scientific community.

"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study? (3) How to accurately capture possible interactions between multiple genetic factors and their joint contribution to phenotypic variation? In particular, we will develop data structures and efficient algorithms for accurate and robust significance assessment that account for local population structure and joint effect of multiple genetic factors.    The proposed computational tools will be integrated into software packages under common application framework adopted by the broad scientific community.

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor � (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk.

"VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA This R21 application proposes to use a large cohort of schizophrenia and healthy control subjects (2415 subjects) from the GENUS Consortium to clarify morphometric and genetic aspects of the corpus callosum (CC) and the lateral ventricles (LV) in schizophrenia (SZ). Our preliminary data indicate that LV and CC volume abnormalities are correlated in SZ, and index global functioning. Although abnormalities of LV and CC are hallmark of SZ and appear together in neurodevelopmental syndromes, LV and CC have rarely been studied together in SZ. Genetically, LV and CC are highly correlated, nonetheless the specific genetic determinants of this relationship are currently unknown. Recently, the SZ associated genetic risk variant miR137 has been shown to associate with LV and whole brain diffusion abnormalities in SZ where the two measures correlate. MiR137 has also been associated with poor cognitive and high negative symptoms load SZ, characterized by poor global functioning. By employing the unprecedented power of the GENUS cohort we will be able to clarify what appears to be a convergence of neuroimaging, symptomatology, cognitive measures and genetics information of LV and CC, and their relationship in one single large population of SZ and HC. This study is expected to provide novel data on the junction between morphometric measures of the corpus callosum and the lateral ventricles, their genetic background and their relation with symptoms and cognition in SZ and to identify subgroups of SZ based on these variables. The long term ramification of this proposal is the identification of novel therapeutic targets, based on miR137. T herapeutics based on miRNA, like miR137, are already been used in phase I cancer clinical trials, a disease that like SZ is polygenic. Finally, our study will reveal new information on the genetics of SZ and its relationship to symptomatology and brain variables. The lateral ventricles and corpus callosum are genetically correlated, and are often abnormal in schizophrenia, nonetheless, the genetic determinants of their relationship in schizophrenia remains unknown. Accordingly, we will employ the largest known population of schizophrenia and healthy subjects available, which includes morphometric, functional, cognitive and genetic data (2514 subjects), where we will analyze abnormalities of the lateral ventricles and the corpus callosum, and their relationship in schizophrenia. Volumetric and diffusion data will be explored for association with one of the strongest SZ associated genetic risk variant, MIR137, and with other genes, also SZ associated and themselves regulated by MIR137 and the outcome will be the identification of schizophrenia subgroups for more targeted intervention.","VENTRICLES, CORPUS CALLOSUM, SYMPTOMS & MIR137 IN LARGE N STUDY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA",9245247,R21MH109819,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caucasians', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fiber', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Proxy', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'Variant', 'axonal degeneration', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'disability', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'lateral ventricle', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'symptomatology', 'trend']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R21,2016,240505,-0.010571975753317978
"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,9058561,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'differential expression', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome browser', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,343125,-0.0031968149954668844

The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality.

"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Modeling Dimensionality and Genetic Heterogeneity in Schizophrenia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SZ) represents a significant and costly public health burden. Recently, we have witnessed the emergence of the first molecular insights into the etiopathogenic mechanisms of SZ, via the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sufficient case-control sample sizes to detect allelic effects. Importantly, a polygenic signature, which includes genome-wide significant common genetic variants of small effect, has been clearly demonstrated to influence SZ risk. The availability of well-defined risk factors makes it possible, for the first time, to address several critical questions about the genetic architecture of SZ and its component phenotypes and endophenotypes. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are 1) to test polygenic risk score prediction of dimensional SZ and schizotypy phenotypes across large case, high-density SZ pedigree, and prodromal-aged GWAS samples, and 2) to develop and test, with leaders of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, innovative statistical methods to identify and characterize ""genetic subtypes"" of SZ.  This proposal delineates a series of training and research goals for the candidate that incorporates strengths from phenotypic assessment, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics and combines samples reflecting a broad range of genetic risk. The candidate will capitalize on previously established expertise in schizotypy and clinical risk assessment, as well as expertise in the familial transmission of dimensional traits, to establish a program of translational research wherein the application of statistical genetic/bioinformatic techniques to genetic subtyping analyses will be used to generate promising candidates for further exploration in human genomic data. Empirically-based genetic subtyping methods will be developed and tested in the largest SZ case sample to date, and subtypes will be characterized with respect to dimensional phenotypic traits. Top loci hits in subtype analyses of dimensional symptoms will be validated in secondary analyses of differential gene expression in post-mortem SZ brain. This will allow for a detailed analysis of function at both the SNP and gene levels, and will provide the candidate with substantive training in both statistical and molecular genetics methods. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing a comprehensive program in SZ research, and the proposed research represents an important contribution toward advancing the understanding of SZ through a combination of clinical, statistical, molecular, and translational methods, consistent with the mission of the NIMH.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia constitute 13% of the global burden of disease and schizophrenia, although relatively rare, is highly heritable (80%) and one of the most severe mental disorders. This project aims to elucidate the influence of genetic factors and gene function on dimensional schizophrenia and schizotypy symptoms with multiple measures, across multiple samples of varying genetic risk.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9114170,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Mood Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phenomenological models', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2016,2560433,0.00159517969570159
"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system. It has direct implications in many human diseases developmental and psychiatric diseases such as Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia.                ",Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening,9116662,R01GM088333,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Fill-It', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Inbreeding', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morphology', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'fly', 'forward genetics', 'genetic approach', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'synaptogenesis', 'targeted treatment', 'technology development', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,306503,0.013414314685224893
"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. The computational tools stemming from this research will enable efficient and accurate inference under complex population genetic models, thereby broadly facilitating research efforts to understand the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk.                ",Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics,8887722,R01GM094402,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computerized tools', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'fitness', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic selection', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'interest', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'open source', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'stem', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2015,303504,0.0001475827582525271
"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis.

"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,8910299,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2015,38673,0.029967395992051494
"Accelerating Curation of GWAS Catalog by Automatic Text Mining     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach to detecting genetic variations associated with particular diseases or traits by scanning markers across the genomes of a large-scale sample of subjects in a high-throughput manner. In less than a decade, GWAS studies have been successfully producing discovery and replication of many new disease loci. Discovered genetic associations have led to development of better strategies to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases. The number of GWAS is growing rapidly. There is a need for a database that allows researchers to easily query and search for previous results. A well-curated database also provides a resource for overview and summarization investigations of associated genetic sites and may help suggest pleiotropic genes. Such a database has been created and maintained by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), called ""A Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies"" (Catalog of GWAS). The catalog has led to interesting characterization of previous results in GWAS and NHGRI has continued to update and curate the catalog regularly. However, this is performed by manually extracting information from published GWAS articles. As a result, the coverage is low compared to the volume of all GWAS publications and would be impossible to catch up the pace of new publications. The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. Our proposal is to use the curated data currently available from NHGRI as the training examples and apply novel machine-learning algorithms to train an information extractor to allow accurate automatic extraction. Given our recent success in applying machine learning to biological text mining, we are confident that this will lead to a useful tool to improve the productivity of curators and solve the coverage problem. Our first specific aim is to develop an accurate information extractor. Our second specific aim is to develop an easy-to-use curation tool for curators to efficiently check and correct errors from automatic information extraction so that their curation productivity can be improved by 18 folds. Then we will adapt the tool to extraction and curation of research papers reporting association studies using data from next generation sequencing. Currently, study design and the reporting of GWAS results using NGS data are not standardized. These results have not been considered to be included in the catalog yet. However, we expect that the limitations will be overcome and the methodology will converge soon. We will closely monitor the progress and adapt the tool to allow for inclusion of the NGS data. Finally, we will distribute the software to the public domain so that volunteers or interested parties can create their own catalog locally. It is our goal to share the developed software with the research community to advance the field. The new algorithms developed in this project and the entire development cycle, from design to deployment, will also contribute to the state-of-the- arts of biological text mining.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. The catalog contains information about SNP-trait/disease associations that are extracted from published genome-wide association studies. A well-curated catalog of GWAS allows researchers to easily query and search for previous results and provides a useful resource for overview and summarization investigations of associated genetic sites and may help suggest pleiotropic genes.            ",Accelerating Curation of GWAS Catalog by Automatic Text Mining,9052542,U01HG006894,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Paper', 'Productivity', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'base', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2015,130994,-0.02391864658518207
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment. In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1.             Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,8962812,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,352350,-0.01046581845391277
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development. Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease.

"Systems genetic and reverse phenotypic analysis of age and retirement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput genomic platforms have revealed a profound effect of age on gene expression and gene methylation levels. For example, our integromic analysis of multiple publicly available data sets have identified hundreds of age related genes that can be organized into network modules. These gene sets along with genes and pathways known from the vast literature on aging and longevity provide valuable candidates in allelic association studies of the health and well-being of older Americans. The rich longitudinal data set and the genome wide scans of DNA samples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provide a unique resource for evaluating the phenotypic effects of genetic variants underlying aging related genes, gene sets and for developing multivariable models that include behavioral, psychosocial, and genetic factors. This proposal aims to apply systems biologic and systems genetic methods for identifying gene sets based on existing gene expression, gene methylation, and multiple large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying these genes will then be related to health, cognitive, behavioral, and economic phenotypes using multivariable regression-, machine learning-, and weighted network analysis approaches. An iterative process between SNP and phenotype selection facilitates the definition of clinically and economically important phenotypes under genetic control (reverse phenotyping). The proposal will not only elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of retirement relevant phenotypes (cognitive functioning, psychosocial factors, and health related expenditures) but also lead to a phenotypic annotation of aging related genes and pathways. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: State of the art statistical, computational, and network approaches for integrating genomic data with the valuable phenotypic and genetic data provided by the Health and Retirement Study is expected to lead to the identification of genetic markers relevant for improving the lives of America's older adults.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,8928177,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'Cresols', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,673919,-0.009794706519300943
"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease. The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.",Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations,8919917,R01GM104125,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Inbreeding', 'Influentials', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Recombinants', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'genetic resource', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'prospective', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,241086,-0.0017056383838743214
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of most human disease involves multiple, molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway and treatment contexts. While this system has been probed by the thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, careful extraction of signals relevant to these specific contexts is a challenging problem. General integration of these heterogeneous data was an important first step in detecting signals that be used to build networks to generate experimentally-testable hypotheses. However, only by dealing with the fact that disease happens at the intersection of multiple contexts and by integrating functional genomics with quantitative genetics will we be able to move toward a molecular-level understanding of human pathophysiology, which will pave the way to new therapy and drug development.  The long-term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through the development of innovative bioinformatics frameworks for integrative analysis of diverse functional genomic data. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration and visualization methodologies for most common model organisms and human, created methods for tissue-specific data analysis, and applied these methods to make novel insights about important biological processes. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by implementing these methods in publicly accessible interactive systems that are popular with experimental biologists.  Leveraging our prior work, we now will directly address the challenge of enabling data-driven study of molecular mechanisms underlying human disease by developing novel semi-supervised and multi-task machine learning approaches and implementing them in a real-time integration system capable of predicting genome-scale functional and mechanism-specific networks focused on any biological context of interest. This will allow any biomedical researcher to quickly make data-driven hypotheses about function, interactions, and regulation of genes involved in hypertension in the kidney glomerulus or to predict new regulatory interactions relevant to Parkinson's disease that affect the ubiquitination pathway in Substantia nigra. Furthermore, we will develop methods for disease gene discovery that leverage these highly specific networks for functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Our deliverable will be a general, robust, user-friendly, and automatically updated system for user-driven functional genomic data integration and functional analysis of quantitative genetics data. Throughout this work, we (with our close experimental and clinical collaborators) will also apply our methods to chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders both as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to make direct contribution to better understanding of these diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will create a web-accessible system that will enable biologists and clinicians to generate hypotheses regarding disease-linked genes, molecular mechanisms underlying genetic disorders, and drug discovery for more targeted treatment. Underlying this user-friendly web interface will be novel algorithms for on-the-fly integration of  vast amount of functional genomics and quantitative genetics data based on the context(s) defined by the biologist or clinician. As applied to the three case study areas, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease/hypertension, and autism spectrum disorders, our system has the potential to identify novel disease genes and pathways and to enable development of better diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and, in the longer term, treatments.            ",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,8886554,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Imagery', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ubiquitination', 'Update', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'gene discovery', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'multitask', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,473642,0.011546919416021283
"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear. We propose a novel computational method that links mechanistically the genetic variability to disease risk and apply it to a range of mental disorder studies to provide more biological insights and enable discovery of potential targets for drug development.            ","Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect",8945859,R01MH107666,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Architecture', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2015,487902,-0.036398830279676934
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient. The information we learn may eventually lead to a more personalized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of COPD patients.            ",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE,8965166,R01HL125583,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Malignant', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spirometry', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transcript', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'response', 'small airways disease', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,911563,-0.015634203806669956
"Developing integrative approaches for identifying disease-causing genes and dysfunctional networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Cancer is a consequence of the accumulation of genetic alterations. Large whole-genome scale resequencing projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have been launched in an effort to comprehensively catalog the genomic mutations and epigenetic modifications that are associated with cancer. It is essential to identify cancer-causing genes and pathways to gain insight into the disease mechanisms and hence facilitate early diagnosis and optimal treatment. However, identifying cancer-causing genes and their functional pathways remains challenging due to the complex biological interactions and the heterogeneity of diseases. Genetic mutations in disease-causing genes can disturb signaling pathways that impact the expression of a set of genes performing certain biological functions. We refer to a set of such genes as a functional module. We hypothesize that driver mutations, that is, mutations that lead to cancer progression, are likely to affect common disease-associated functional modules, and the causal relationship between the mutations and the perturbed signals of the modules can be reconstructed from gene expression data and protein interaction data. In this project, we will develop a novel approach to infer disease-causing genes and networks by integrating information from multiple types of data including genomic variations, gene expression and protein interactions. We first dynamically identify disease-associated modules that consist of a set of interacting genes, then develop a Bayesian-based approach to infer causative genes from the disease-associated modules. Then, by developing a stochastic search based method, we can determine the paths connecting causative genes and gene modules. As a result, disease- related pathways are inferred from the paths. Furthermore, we will integrate those pathways with the human interactome to discover higher-level disease-associated networks. In addition, we will develop machine learning based classifiers to predict disease types and clinical outcomes utilizing the molecular signatures identified in this project, such as differentially expressed gene modules and causative genes. Our computational framework and classifiers will be made available to the research community via a webserver. The PI serves as the university bioinformatics program director and has extensive teaching and research experience. A goal of this project is also to provide scientific research training to students and o help students to gain biological insight through their involvement with the project. Students will learn practical scientific computing skills from the PI and develop their own computational approaches to solving specific biomedical problems under the guidance of the PI. Thus the project will serve as an effective learning-research model in bioinformatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop and implement a novel framework to identify causative mutations and pathways and study cancer disease mechanisms by reconstructing signaling pathways. This will help to advance personalized medicine and lead to a greater understanding of cancer mechanisms, which can lay the foundation for improving early diagnosis and treatment planning, as well as the discovery of new therapeutic targets.            ",Developing integrative approaches for identifying disease-causing genes and dysfunctional networks,8880075,R15GM114739,"['Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Universities', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer framework', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'prospective', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'scientific computing', 'skills', 'treatment planning', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT LITTLE ROCK,R15,2015,373520,-0.01725942396707315
"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). We propose to perform a comprehensive screen of more than 450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome using DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sorted cell populations, and labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from SS cases and control individuals to identify epigenetic profiles that are predictive of disease risk and specifi clinical phenotypes. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of several different cell and tissue types and whole genome SNP data have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, and may lead to more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.                ",Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome,8829521,R03DE024316,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Budgets', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human DNA', 'interest', 'member', 'monocyte', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'systemic autoimmune disease']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2015,236912,0.019272702487139057
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies. Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies.

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor � (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8852606,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2015,169572,-0.016497526290934962
"Fast and Robust Methods for Large Scale Genotype Phenotype Association Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental challenge in life sciences is the characterization of genetic factors that underlie phenotypic differences. Thanks to the advanced sequencing technologies, an enormous amount of genetic variants have been identified and cataloged. Such data hold great potential to understand how genes affect phenotypes and contribute to the susceptibility to environmental stimulus. However, the existing computational methods for analyzing and interpreting the high‐throughput genetic data are still in their infancy.    We propose to systematically investigate the computational and statistical principles in modeling and discovering genetic basis of complex phenotypes. The proposed research provides answers to the following fundamental questions in genetic association study: (1) How to effectively and efficiently assess statistical significance of the findings? (2) How to account for the relatedness between samples in genetic association study? (3) How to accurately capture possible interactions between multiple genetic factors and their joint contribution to phenotypic variation?

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ""missing heritability"" will require moving beyond the current ""one SNP at a time"" genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate's long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ""risk profile"" score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan - statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello - developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale - statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ""discovery"" phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples - the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate's career development. The CBRPM's mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders - central topics of the candidate's career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts.

"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear. This project focuses on building new flexible, data-adaptive tools to translate this wealth of low level information into actionable discoveries, and actual biological understanding.",Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics,8929328,DP5OD019820,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'flexibility', 'genetic makeup', 'high throughput analysis', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP5,2015,329422,0.02079375863025908

"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development. These studies have implications for generation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for colon cancer. n/a",Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci,8916038,U01CA151920,"['Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complementary DNA', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intestines', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Study', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'authority', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'candidate validation', 'clinical phenotype', 'combinatorial', 'computer studies', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'forging', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'intestinal epithelium', 'mathematical model', 'mutant', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'segregation', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistics', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,538250,-0.01321534200172835
"EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, ""EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics"" intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system.

"Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped thousands of common trait-influencing variants yet the overwhelming majority of trait loci have yet to be discovered. The goal of this proposal is to develop and apply statistical approaches that move beyond the standard GWAS paradigm to map additional trait-influencing variation within the human genome. Most of our proposed tools are based on a flexible high-dimensional framework called kernel machine regression, which we have had past success employing for powerful gene mapping of complex traits in GWAS and next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. We believe the inherent flexibility of the kernel framework makes it ideal for exploring new paradigms in gene mapping of complex human traits. Aim 1 proposes novel kernel methods for integrated analysis of both single-nucleotide variation data (derived from GWAS and/or NGS) and genomic data (such as gene-expression and methylation patterns) that we believe will provide improved power for trait mapping. Aim 2 proposes novel kernel methods for large scale gene-gene interaction analysis across the genome, as well as a computational approach that enables efficient adjustment for multiple testing when applying such exhaustive testing procedures. Aim 3 establishes novel kernel methods for association mapping of SNVs on the X chromosome. The flexible nature of kernel machines makes it ideal for modeling potential sex-specific effects on this chromosome and the methods further can accommodate random X inactivation. Aim 4 proposes novel kernel approach for robust analysis of rare trait-influencing variation within families; such family-based designs are generally not considered in current rare-variant procedures. We will evaluate these methods on large-scale datasets that we are actively involved in and will implement the methods in user-friendly software for public distribution (Aim 5). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel and powerful statistical tools for identifying genetic loci acting independently or in conjunction with other genetic/environmental factors to influence complex human diseases or disease-related quantitative traits. Application of the proposed methods to applied datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of complex traits and enhance existing risk-prediction models of complex disease.",Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines,8894057,R01HG007508,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nuclear Family', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Sex Bias', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Study models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'X inherited trait', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'design', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'methylation pattern', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'user friendly software']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,341249,-0.013727109890610304
"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,8899611,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'differential expression', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,343125,-0.0031968149954668844
"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher. n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8916113,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2015,175392,-0.03002231252615565
"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

"Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), afflicting ~1 in 10,000 North American Children, encompasses a highly heterogeneous group of chronic, immune-mediated joint disorders. Aside from causing severe pain, tissue damage, and physical immobility, chronic disease activity leads to permanent short stature and limb disfigurement. Similar to a number of other complex polygenic autoimmune diseases, there is a clear heritable component to JIA, but all known genetic risk factors explain less than 20% of disease heritability. The majority of this is attributable to variation across the Major Histocompatibility  (MHC) locus, yet definitive high-resolution identification of MHC associations in JIA have not been conclusive. JIA is currently classified into seven clinical subtypes, based on a classification schema that has little research or clinical utility, since 10-50% of cases are classified as ""undifferentiated"". Biological and molecular evidence based on the presence of serum autoantibodies and other molecular biomarkers of immunological defects suggest that the existing seven JIA subtypes could be grouped into two major classes-subtypes that represent either predominantly seropositive autoimmune (AID) diseases or seronegative autoinflammatory (AIF) diseases. Whether genetic risk factors differ for AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes is unknown, especially since the traditional approach to genetic association studies is poorly powered to identify loci with subtype- specific effects in the presence of significant phenotypic heterogeneity. To test the hypothesis that distinct genetic risk factors underlie the clinically observed differences in AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes and identify both shared and subtype-distinct genetic susceptibility loci, I propose to use a subtype-sensitive GWAS to identify JIA disease subtype-specific genetics associations, evaluate evidence for functional HLA associations that are distinct or shared across JIA subtypes, and test if the identified genetic associations can be used to predict disease susceptibility, distinguish patients who belong to AID versus AIF-like JIA classes, and reclassify patients currently defined as having undifferentiated disease. The analysis approach proposed here integrates genomic screening, disease modeling and prediction, and the use of expression and functional data resources to better understand the etiology of JIA. The successful completion of this work will likely yield novel biomolecular or pathway-based targets for the development of therapeutic agents for children with JIA and patients with other related rheumatological or immunological diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis is a severe pediatric form of immune-mediate joint disease that can result in significant morbidity and life-long disability. While the etiology of JIA, similar to other complex autoimmune and inflammatory disorders that together affect nearly 10% of the United States population, is not well-understood, a strong genetic component has been demonstrated. My proposal aims to develop novel genome-wide analysis tools and applies these tools to the identification of genetic risk susceptibility factorsin JIA and other heterogeneous, complex hereditary disorders, which have the potential to yield promising disease-specific molecular and pharmacologic targets.",Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,8879958,F30AR066486,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Siblings', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'TNFRSF10A gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'seropositive', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2015,46443,-0.010180073122381986
"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD. There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.",Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders,8860253,R01NS076465,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Betaine', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Cancer Biology', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Folic Acid', 'Food Supply', 'Fortified Food', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knockout Mice', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Tube Closure', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Neural tube', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Dysraphism', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Supplementation', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'embryo tissue', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'folate-binding protein', 'folic acid metabolism', 'fortification', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'man', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'neonate', 'neurogenetics', 'peripheral blood', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'receptor', 'response', 'risk variant', 'standard of care', 'stem', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2015,872134,0.019506727228303794

"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.                ","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",8965736,U01HG008657,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'outreach', 'polyposis', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U01,2015,859799,0.003991731947155501
"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.                ",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),9117098,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'phenomenological models', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2015,194377,0.00159517969570159

"Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Synapses are most fundamental to the function of a nervous system. C. elegans is an excellent genetic model system for finding genes and elucidating pathways because of its sequenced genome and the abundance of molecular biology tools and mutants. Due to the simplicity of its nervous system, many breakthroughs have been made in C. elegans for understanding molecular mechanisms in the patterning of the nervous system and synapse development. The current bottlenecks are in the manual and non-quantitative techniques such as visual screens, limiting both the throughput of the experiments and the phenotypes one can examine. Our long-term objective is to develop technologies and to understand how genes, age, and the environment together define and continue to remodel the nervous system of an organism. In the last funding period, we have made large progress in hardware system design (including microtechnologies and automation technologies) and software for quantitative characterization of phenotypes. The objective of this continuation project is to further engineer superior micro devices for large-scale live imaging and quantitative imaging technologies, and combine with the power of genetic and genomic approaches to study synapse development in this in vivo system; genes and pathways emerging from this study could potentially become targets of therapeutics in neurological disorders.  We have shown in the previous phase of the project that quantitative microscopy-based approaches can indeed enable identification of novel genes and pathways that conventional approaches cannot. In the continuation phase, we will further optimize on-chip rapid and high-content in vivo imaging techniques, and in parallel further develop algorithms and quantitative measures for the analysis of such high-content data; we will screen based on novel synthetic phenotype unobservable by eye; we will also exploit powerful genomic techniques to identify loci and potential multigenic interactions that shape the synapse morphology. These experimental approaches will identify genes that cannot have been identified otherwise because of the difficulties associated with the phenotypical profiling, but addressed using our engineered techniques here. The approach is innovative because the technology developed here dramatically increases the throughput, sensitivity, and accuracy of the experiments, and truly enables the utility of extremely powerful genetic and genomic methods. The proposed research is significant because it fills the urgent need in high-throughput and high-content screens as well as identifying novel genes and pathways. In addition, besides the contribution to the specific neurobiology, the technologies are widely applicable to areas such as developmental cell biology, and to other small organisms such as fly larvae and zebrafish embryos.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Synapse development is an important and active area of research linking genes and environments to the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system. It has direct implications in many human diseases developmental and psychiatric diseases such as Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia.                ",Quantitative microscopy-based rapid phenotyping and screening,8964929,R01GM088333,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Fill-It', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Inbreeding', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morphology', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'fly', 'forward genetics', 'genetic approach', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'mutant', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'synaptogenesis', 'technology development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,307094,0.013414314685224893
"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis. The success of this project will be important in bridging statistical machine learning and cancer research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This project aims to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems, especially for problems with high dimensional and noisy data such as gene expression data.

"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis.

"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.        This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.

"Accelerating Curation of GWAS Catalog by Automatic Text Mining     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach to detecting genetic variations associated with particular diseases or traits by scanning markers across the genomes of a large-scale sample of subjects in a high-throughput manner. In less than a decade, GWAS studies have been successfully producing discovery and replication of many new disease loci. Discovered genetic associations have led to development of better strategies to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases. The number of GWAS is growing rapidly. There is a need for a database that allows researchers to easily query and search for previous results. A well-curated database also provides a resource for overview and summarization investigations of associated genetic sites and may help suggest pleiotropic genes. Such a database has been created and maintained by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), called ""A Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies"" (Catalog of GWAS). The catalog has led to interesting characterization of previous results in GWAS and NHGRI has continued to update and curate the catalog regularly. However, this is performed by manually extracting information from published GWAS articles. As a result, the coverage is low compared to the volume of all GWAS publications and would be impossible to catch up the pace of new publications. The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. Our proposal is to use the curated data currently available from NHGRI as the training examples and apply novel machine-learning algorithms to train an information extractor to allow accurate automatic extraction. Given our recent success in applying machine learning to biological text mining, we are confident that this will lead to a useful tool to improve the productivity of curators and solve the coverage problem. Our first specific aim is to develop an accurate information extractor. Our second specific aim is to develop an easy-to-use curation tool for curators to efficiently check and correct errors from automatic information extraction so that their curation productivity can be improved by 18 folds. Then we will adapt the tool to extraction and curation of research papers reporting association studies using data from next generation sequencing. Currently, study design and the reporting of GWAS results using NGS data are not standardized. These results have not been considered to be included in the catalog yet. However, we expect that the limitations will be overcome and the methodology will converge soon. We will closely monitor the progress and adapt the tool to allow for inclusion of the NGS data. Finally, we will distribute the software to the public domain so that volunteers or interested parties can create their own catalog locally. It is our goal to share the developed software with the research community to advance the field.

The catalog contains information about SNP-trait/disease associations that are extracted from published genome-wide association studies. A well-curated catalog of GWAS allows researchers to easily query and search for previous results and provides a useful resource for overview and summarization investigations of associated genetic sites and may help suggest pleiotropic genes.            ",Accelerating Curation of GWAS Catalog by Automatic Text Mining,8686917,U01HG006894,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Paper', 'Productivity', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'base', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2014,277488,-0.02391864658518207
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.          Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease. This global overview will help us develop specific solutions to the problems of preventing and treating malaria.

"Systems genetic and reverse phenotypic analysis of age and retirement     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput genomic platforms have revealed a profound effect of age on gene expression and gene methylation levels. For example, our integromic analysis of multiple publicly available data sets have identified hundreds of age related genes that can be organized into network modules. These gene sets along with genes and pathways known from the vast literature on aging and longevity provide valuable candidates in allelic association studies of the health and well-being of older Americans. The rich longitudinal data set and the genome wide scans of DNA samples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provide a unique resource for evaluating the phenotypic effects of genetic variants underlying aging related genes, gene sets and for developing multivariable models that include behavioral, psychosocial, and genetic factors. This proposal aims to apply systems biologic and systems genetic methods for identifying gene sets based on existing gene expression, gene methylation, and multiple large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying these genes will then be related to health, cognitive, behavioral, and economic phenotypes using multivariable regression-, machine learning-, and weighted network analysis approaches. An iterative process between SNP and phenotype selection facilitates the definition of clinically and economically important phenotypes under genetic control (reverse phenotyping). The proposal will not only elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of retirement relevant phenotypes (cognitive functioning, psychosocial factors, and health related expenditures) but also lead to a phenotypic annotation of aging related genes and pathways.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: State of the art statistical, computational, and network approaches for integrating genomic data with the valuable phenotypic and genetic data provided by the Health and Retirement Study is expected to lead to the identification of genetic markers relevant for improving the lives of America's older adults.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.            ",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,8817197,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'Cresols', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,727558,-0.009794706519300943
"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8656359,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,492794,0.011846624384468442
"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.              The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility. PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases. We will then apply these new computational methods to identifying genetic biomarkers of bladder cancer in an epidemiological study from New Hampshire.",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,9019684,R01LM009012,[' '],NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,358350,0.01608838769018489
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.             Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data. The methods and tools are developed and evaluated in an imaging genetic study of Alzheimer's disease, and can also be applied to many other disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics,8714056,R01LM011360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Beds', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heart', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'public-private partnership', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2014,330386,-0.00579675395669133
"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health.    Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR Phenome for Gene-disease Associations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve clinical understanding of risks and mechanisms for many diseases and conditions and that may ultimately guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will expand on existing work to identify gene-phenotype associations across the genome and phenome, deploying new phenome-wide associations study (PheWAS) methods to deeply investigate electronic medical record (EMR)-derived phenotypes across common and rare variants across the genome. The project is enabled by large DNA biobanks coupled to de-identified copies of EMR. This project has three specific aims. First, we will expand the PheWAS phenotype library to include both binary traits and continuous variables incorporating about 7000 phenotypes derived from natural language processing, laboratory data, and report data. The second aim is to perform a PheWAS for common and rare variants using extant genome-wide and exome variant data and the broader set of phenotypes derived in Aim 1. We will analyze associations using single variant and multi-variant aggregation methods. We will validate the efficacy of our methods in Aim 2 by comparing to known associations. The third aim is to develop a standards-based infrastructure to share PheWAS results and develop tools to enable others to perform PheWAS. The tools generated from this project will not only expand the capabilities of the current PheWAS methodology, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.             Project Narrative Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnosis and for more effective, patient- specific therapies.

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                  ",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8676787,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2014,169572,-0.016497526290934962
"Heterogeneous and Robust Survival Analysis in Genomic Studies     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to develop powerful and computationally-efficient statistical methods for statistical modeling of high-dimensional genomic data motivated by important biological problems and experiments. The specific aims of the current project include developing novel survival analysis methods to model the heterogeneity in both patients and biomarkers in genomic studies and developing robust survival analysis methods to analyze high-dimensional genomic data. The proposed methods hinge on a novel integration of methods in high-dimensional data analysis, theory in statistical learning and methods in human genomics. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies of these methods and compare them with existing methods. Results from applying the methods to studies of ovarian cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer will help ensure that maximal information is obtained from the high-throughput experiments conducted by our collaborators as well as data that are publicly available. Software will be made available through Bioconductor to ensure that the scientific community benefits from the methods developed.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     NARRATIVE The last decade of advanced laboratory techniques has had a profound impact on genomic research, however, the development of corresponding statistical methods to analyze the data has not been in the same pace.

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts.

"Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of high throughput biological data. Effective methods for analyzing this data must balance two opposing ideals. They must be (a) flexible and sufficiently data-adaptive to deal with the data's complex structure, yet (b) sufficiently simpe and transparent to interpret their results and analyze their uncertainty (so as not to mislead with conviction). This is additionally challenging because these datasets are massive, so attacking these problems requires a marriage of statistical and computational ideas. This project develops frameworks for attacking several problems involving this biological data. These frameworks balance flexibility and simplicity and are computationally tractable even on massive datasets. This application has three specific aims. Aim 1: A flexible and computationally tractable framework for building predictive models. Commonly we are interested in modelling phenotypic traits of an individual using omics data. We would like to find a small subset of genetic features which are important in phenotype expression level. In this approach, I propose a method for flexibly modelling a response variable (e.g. phenotype) with a small, adaptively chosen subset of features, in a computationally scalable fashion. Aim 2: A framework for jointly identifying and testing regions which differ across conditions. For example, in the context of methylation data measured in normal and cancer tissue samples, one might expect that some regions are more methylated in one tissue type or the other. These regions might suggest targets for therapy. However, we do not have the background biological knowledge to pre-specify regions to test. I propose an approach which adaptively selects regions and then tests them in a principled way. This approach is based on a convex formulation to the problem, using shrinkage to achieve sparse differences. Aim 3: A principled framework for developing and evaluating predictive biomarkers during clinical trials. Modern treatments target specific genetic abnormalities that are generally present in only a subset of patients with a disease. A major current goal in medicine is to develop biomarkers that identify those patients likely to benefit from treatment. I propose a framework for developing and testing biomarkers during large-scale clinical trials. This framework simultaneously builds these biomarkers and applies them to restrict enrollment into the trial to only those likely to benefit from treatment. The statistical tools that result from th proposed research will be implemented in freely available software.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnology have provided us with a wealth of new biological data, a large step towards unlocking the tantalizing promise of personalized medicine: the tailoring of treatment to the genetic makeup of each individual and disease. However, classical statistical and computational tools have proven unable to exploit the extensive information these new experimental technologies bring to bear. This project focuses on building new flexible, data-adaptive tools to translate this wealth of low level information into actionable discoveries, and actual biological understanding.            ",Data-Driven Statistical Learning with Applications to Genomics,8796068,DP5OD019820,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteomics', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'flexibility', 'high throughput analysis', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP5,2014,361063,0.02079375863025908
"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8726983,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2014,175392,-0.03002231252615565
"Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped thousands of common trait-influencing variants yet the overwhelming majority of trait loci have yet to be discovered. The goal of this proposal is to develop and apply statistical approaches that move beyond the standard GWAS paradigm to map additional trait-influencing variation within the human genome. Most of our proposed tools are based on a flexible high-dimensional framework called kernel machine regression, which we have had past success employing for powerful gene mapping of complex traits in GWAS and next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. We believe the inherent flexibility of the kernel framework makes it ideal for exploring new paradigms in gene mapping of complex human traits. Aim 1 proposes novel kernel methods for integrated analysis of both single-nucleotide variation data (derived from GWAS and/or NGS) and genomic data (such as gene-expression and methylation patterns) that we believe will provide improved power for trait mapping. Aim 2 proposes novel kernel methods for large scale gene-gene interaction analysis across the genome, as well as a computational approach that enables efficient adjustment for multiple testing when applying such exhaustive testing procedures. Aim 3 establishes novel kernel methods for association mapping of SNVs on the X chromosome. The flexible nature of kernel machines makes it ideal for modeling potential sex-specific effects on this chromosome and the methods further can accommodate random X inactivation. Aim 4 proposes novel kernel approach for robust analysis of rare trait-influencing variation within families; such family-based designs are generally not considered in current rare-variant procedures. We will evaluate these methods on large-scale datasets that we are actively involved in and will implement the methods in user-friendly software for public distribution (Aim 5).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel and powerful statistical tools for identifying genetic loci acting independently or in conjunction with other genetic/environmental factors to influence complex human diseases or disease-related quantitative traits. Application of the proposed methods to applied datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of complex traits and enhance existing risk-prediction models of complex disease.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.            ",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,8759963,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,343125,-0.0031968149954668844
"Whole-Genome Prediction of Type-2 Diabetes Susceptibility in Various Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's career goal is to become a productive independent investigator in the area of statistical genetics, particularly in the area of genomic-based prediction of type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk. To meet this goal, the applicant proposes a career development plan that includes hands- on and didactic training in statistical learning as applied to quantitative genetics, categorical and case-control data analysis, informatics as applied to high dimensional genetic data, and the biology and genetics of T2D. A highly accomplished and diverse set of investigators with proven track records of successful mentoring will oversee the applicant's career development. The research component of this project seeks to improve our ability to use genetic information to predict an individual's risk of developing T2D Publically available genetic and phenotypic data from sources such as dbGaP (The database of Phenotypes and Genotypes) will be used to develop and test various models for prediction of T2D risk among three racial/ethnic groups. This project will capitalize on newly developed statistical methods that are able to incorporate information from tens of thousands of genetic markers at once, which represent a major advance over current methods that typically take fewer than 100 markers into account. The aims of the study are: 1) To test the hypothesis, in different populations, that individualized whole-genome prediction of T2D (along with standard covariates of sex, age, and BMI) will offer major improvements over current genetics-based prediction models, and will offer equal or greater accuracy than prediction based on family history; 2) To impute additional genetic markers to determine whether prediction can be improved, and to identify the subset of markers that is most useful in predicting T2D; 3) To develop prediction models for T2D risk given a certain body mass index (BMI), by including as predictors the interaction of BMI and genotypes. This project will greatly enhance our ability to predict an individual's susceptibility to T2D within various populations, leading to earlier and targeted prevention strategies, will increase our understanding of the genetic basis of T2D, and will provide critical training for Dr. Klimentidis' development as an independent scientist.      Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries. In this application, we propose to use state-of-the-art statistical methods that enable us to account for thousands of genetic variants simultaneously, in order to build and test predictive models for T2D susceptibility among individuals of European, Mexican, and African descent. This project has the potential to greatly improve prediction of T2D susceptibility in several ethnic groups, provide a better understanding of the specific genetic factors that play a role in T2D susceptibility, and ultimately bring us closer to the era of personalized medicine in which improved prediction ability results in earlier patient-oriented prevention and treatment.

"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled genome-wide association studies (GWAS or GWA studies). It is compelling that we be able to detect epistasis using GWAS data. However, so far GWA studies have mainly focused on the association of a single gene or loci with a disease. The crucial challenge to analyzing epistasis using GWAS data is finding a way to efficiently handle high-dimensional data sets. The only possible solution is to design efficient algorithms that allow us to find the most relevant epistasic relationships without doing an exhaustive investigation. To the Principal Investigator's knowledge, no current method can do this. This career award will investigate this problem. The specific aims are as follows: (Aim 1) develop and evaluate efficient Bayesian network-based methods for learning candidate genes associated with diseases from GWAS sets. Such genes would provide candidates for follow-up biological studies, (Aim 2) implement the methods in a pilot GWAS system for use by researchers when conducting a GWAS, (Aim 3) develop simulated genome-wide data sets and evaluate the pilot system using these data sets, and (Aim 4) conduct GWA studies concerning breast cancer and lung cancer. Aim 1 will be addressed by developing a succinct Bayesian network model representing epistasis, efficient algorithms which are tailored to investigating such models, integration of the algorithms into methods for learning epistasis, and using simulated datasets to test the effectiveness of the methods and compare their performance to other methods. Aim 2 will be met by implementing the methods in a pilot GWAS system. Aim 3 will be satisfied by developing synthetic data sets similar to those found in GWA studies, and using them to evaluate the system. Aim 4 will be achieved by conducting GWA studies concerning breast and lung cancer. By conducting these studies, we can (1) substantiate previous results concerning the genetic basis of these diseases; (2) possibly obtain interesting new findings pertaining to these diseases. The main hypothesis is that the proposed method will be an advance over existing methods in that it will make it computationally feasible to learn epistatic relationships from genome-wide data and it will therefore yield better discovery performance than existing methods.  Learning gene-gene interactions from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data is an important and challenging task in genetic epidemiology. This project will develop and evaluate a pilot GWAS system for performing this task. Advances obtained in analyzing GWAS data sets could enable us to learn the genetic basis of many diseases and thereby substantially improve the quality of personalized patient care.",Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning,8628875,R00LM010822,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Family history of', 'GAB2 gene', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Programming', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2014,204812,-0.0057157859786745304
"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.          Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response. To tackle these complex data types, we develop novel machine learning, network analysis, and database methods. Our personalized medicine approach will help researchers study and evaluate neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.

"Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), afflicting ~1 in 10,000 North American Children, encompasses a highly heterogeneous group of chronic, immune-mediated joint disorders. Aside from causing severe pain, tissue damage, and physical immobility, chronic disease activity leads to permanent short stature and limb disfigurement. Similar to a number of other complex polygenic autoimmune diseases, there is a clear heritable component to JIA, but all known genetic risk factors explain less than 20% of disease heritability. The majority of this is attributable to variation across the Major Histocompatibility  (MHC) locus, yet definitive high-resolution identification of MHC associations in JIA have not been conclusive. JIA is currently classified into seven clinical subtypes, based on a classification schema that has little research or clinical utility, since 10-50% of cases are classified as ""undifferentiated"". Biological and molecular evidence based on the presence of serum autoantibodies and other molecular biomarkers of immunological defects suggest that the existing seven JIA subtypes could be grouped into two major classes-subtypes that represent either predominantly seropositive autoimmune (AID) diseases or seronegative autoinflammatory (AIF) diseases. Whether genetic risk factors differ for AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes is unknown, especially since the traditional approach to genetic association studies is poorly powered to identify loci with subtype- specific effects in the presence of significant phenotypic heterogeneity. To test the hypothesis that distinct genetic risk factors underlie the clinically observed differences in AID versus AIF-like JIA subtypes and identify both shared and subtype-distinct genetic susceptibility loci, I propose to use a subtype-sensitive GWAS to identify JIA disease subtype-specific genetics associations, evaluate evidence for functional HLA associations that are distinct or shared across JIA subtypes, and test if the identified genetic associations can be used to predict disease susceptibility, distinguish patients who belong to AID versus AIF-like JIA classes, and reclassify patients currently defined as having undifferentiated disease. The analysis approach proposed here integrates genomic screening, disease modeling and prediction, and the use of expression and functional data resources to better understand the etiology of JIA. The successful completion of this work will likely yield novel biomolecular or pathway-based targets for the development of therapeutic agents for children with JIA and patients with other related rheumatological or immunological diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis is a severe pediatric form of immune-mediate joint disease that can result in significant morbidity and life-long disability. While the etiology of JIA, similar to other complex autoimmune and inflammatory disorders that together affect nearly 10% of the United States population, is not well-understood, a strong genetic component has been demonstrated. My proposal aims to develop novel genome-wide analysis tools and applies these tools to the identification of genetic risk susceptibility factorsin JIA and other heterogeneous, complex hereditary disorders, which have the potential to yield promising disease-specific molecular and pharmacologic targets.",Integrative Analysis of Genomic Risk Factors in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,8717915,F30AR066486,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Siblings', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'TNFRSF10A gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'tool']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2014,46078,-0.010180073122381986
"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the accelerated pace of development of technologies for characterizing the human genome, the rate-limiting step for large scale genomic investigation in clinical populations is now phenotyping. This is particularly the case for neuropsychiatric (NP) illness, where phenotypes are complex, biomarkers are lacking, and the primary cell types of interest are difficult to access directly. It has become apparent that both rare and common genetic variation contributes to disease risk and that this risk crosses traditional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatry. Taking advantage of a large, already-established NP biobank could dramatically accelerate progress toward understanding the cross-disorder mechanism of action of disease liability genes. This study proposes novel applications of emerging technologies in informatics and cellular neurobiology to eliminate this phenotyping bottleneck. In doing so, it will accelerate investigation of clinical and cellular phenotypes for understanding single and multilocus/polygenic associations. Aim 1: Adapt and expand one of the largest NP cellular biobanks by parsing electronic health records with gold-standard assessment of cognition and other RDoC phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the genome-wide multidimensional functional genomics (MFG) landscape in NP disease into which the transcriptomic signature (RNA-seq) of each induced neuron (IN) representing a clinically characterized individual is projected. The projection provides the mapping from molecular to phenotypic characterization and a directionality towards healthful/neurotypical states used in Aim 3. Aim 3: Develop a probabilistic model of gene expression dependencies that will predict which small molecular perturbations are likely to shift the IN transcriptomic signature in a healthful direction in the MFG and to then update the model based on measured perturbations in the MFG. Aim 4: Select patient samples to study in greater detail for epigenetic (DNA methylation, histone marks and RNA editing) and transcriptional control particularly with regard to activity dependent changes that have been implicated in many NP diseases. Aim 5: Here we assess just how well the clinical phenotypes are informed by the genome-wide characterizations and assess which is more robust.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is designed to answer the question: can we use the fruits of the first phases of the human genome project to create a new and more robust scheme of classifying neuropsychiatric disease, one that is more reliable with regard to prognosis of these diseases, more insightful as to the biological aberration in each category and, therefore, more effective in treating the patient.                ",Neuropsychiatric Genome-Scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID),8698507,P50MH106933,"['Agonist', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent Forms', 'DNA Methylation', 'DSM-IV', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fruit', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histones', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,P50,2014,2625284,0.00159517969570159
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information.

"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis. The success of this project will be important in bridging statistical machine learning and cancer research.

"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis. The proposed work will be tested on human and cancer genome data, contributing to health IT, one of the National Priority Domain Areas.              n/a",Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics,8599823,R01CA180776,"['Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Instruction', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Molecular Biology', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Social Policies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'data mining', 'design', 'heuristics']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,71329,-0.01204389028097299
"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.        This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.

"Accelerating Curation of GWAS Catalog by Automatic Text Mining     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach to detecting genetic variations associated with particular diseases or traits by scanning markers across the genomes of a large-scale sample of subjects in a high-throughput manner. In less than a decade, GWAS studies have been successfully producing discovery and replication of many new disease loci. Discovered genetic associations have led to development of better strategies to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases. The number of GWAS is growing rapidly. There is a need for a database that allows researchers to easily query and search for previous results. A well-curated database also provides a resource for overview and summarization investigations of associated genetic sites and may help suggest pleiotropic genes. Such a database has been created and maintained by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), called ""A Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies"" (Catalog of GWAS). The catalog has led to interesting characterization of previous results in GWAS and NHGRI has continued to update and curate the catalog regularly. However, this is performed by manually extracting information from published GWAS articles. As a result, the coverage is low compared to the volume of all GWAS publications and would be impossible to catch up the pace of new publications. The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. Our proposal is to use the curated data currently available from NHGRI as the training examples and apply novel machine-learning algorithms to train an information extractor to allow accurate automatic extraction. Given our recent success in applying machine learning to biological text mining, we are confident that this will lead to a useful tool to improve the productivity of curators and solve the coverage problem. Our first specific aim is to develop an accurate information extractor. Our second specific aim is to develop an easy-to-use curation tool for curators to efficiently check and correct errors from automatic information extraction so that their curation productivity can be improved by 18 folds. Then we will adapt the tool to extraction and curation of research papers reporting association studies using data from next generation sequencing. Currently, study design and the reporting of GWAS results using NGS data are not standardized. These results have not been considered to be included in the catalog yet. However, we expect that the limitations will be overcome and the methodology will converge soon. We will closely monitor the progress and adapt the tool to allow for inclusion of the NGS data. Finally, we will distribute the software to the public domain so that volunteers or interested parties can create their own catalog locally. It is our goal to share the developed software with the research community to advance the field. The new algorithms developed in this project and the entire development cycle, from design to deployment, will also contribute to the state-of-the- arts of biological text mining.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. The catalog contains information about SNP-trait/disease associations that are extracted from published genome-wide association studies.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation of gene expression through variation in DNA methylation plays a critical role in a range of biological processes including cellular differentiation, human disease and cancer. New methods for determining the fine structure of methylation patterns genome-wide have led to an explosion of research in this field. Methylation near the gene promoter is correlated with gene silencing, while unmethylated promoters are potentially active. Current computational methods classify genes as either methylated and silenced or unmethylated and potentially active based on a coarse calculation of CpG methylation state across a window of a few hundred base pairs around the transcription start site. The detailed spatial pattern of methylation across the promoter may be an important determinant of gene expression, but current computational methods ignore this valuable information. Recent work has found regions proximal to CpG island promoters, dubbed ""CpG island shores"", whose methylation state correlates with transcription. CpG island shores are loosely defined, however, and this concept is difficult to apply in practice. While other methylation signatures are also likely to correlate with gene expression, a general framework to identify and study them has not been established. New computational tools for identification and correlation of detailed methylation patterns with gene expression are critical for advancing our understanding of the epigenetics of gene regulation. We propose to develop software tools to detect new methylation signatures at gene promoters that correlate with expression. This will be done within a formal framework so that these signatures can be used to determine differentially methylated genes in a variety of study designs. Taking advantage of the fact  that methylation over short ranges are highly correlated, we will interpolate methylation data at individual  CpG sites in a 10 kb window around the TSS to yield a methylation signature at each promoter that is  independent of primary sequence features. We will then use a metric from topology, the discrete Frechet distance, to calculate the similarity between methylation signatures, and apply this metric to cluster signatures of similar type. We will then determine clusters with methylation signatures that correlate with expression.  Clusters that contain both silenced and expressed genes will be examined to see if other local primary sequence features can be used to discriminate the genes based on expression. This approach will be used to detect methylation changes in case-control studies and in pairwise comparisons, such as needed for timecourse analysis or for the detection of different states of differentiation. The general framework developed here can be expanded in the future to examine methylation signatures at enhancers and gene bodies, as well as to histone marks or other genomic signals that carry detailed spatial information.          Narrative  DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, is an important  epigenetic regulator of gene expression in cells. DNA methylation has been implicated in a large number of  biological processes including cellular differentiation and cancer. We will develop software tools to analyze  data from new techniques for mapping DNA methylation genome-wide to discover new methylation signatures  that are associated with silenced and active genes. These will include tools to use these signatures to  determine what genes are differentially regulated in different cell types and in human disease.",A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS,8500440,R21LM011199,"['Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological Process', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG Islands', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Histones', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Metric', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'methyl group', 'promoter', 'research study', 'software development', 'spatial neglect', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,135645,-0.015349675990430014
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.          Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children. This study will develop computational solutions to problems that hitherto have prevented us from gaining a global view of how infection by the malaria parasite leads to the development of the disease. This global overview will help us develop specific solutions to the problems of preventing and treating malaria.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.        While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to quickly identify data sets of interest, expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate test incorporating multiple phenotypes, and perform larger meta-analyses easily by honing in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest with increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.              The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental mouse populations, the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in the mouse.

"Systems genetic and reverse phenotypic analysis of age and retirement     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput genomic platforms have revealed a profound effect of age on gene expression and gene methylation levels. For example, our integromic analysis of multiple publicly available data sets have identified hundreds of age related genes that can be organized into network modules. These gene sets along with genes and pathways known from the vast literature on aging and longevity provide valuable candidates in allelic association studies of the health and well-being of older Americans. The rich longitudinal data set and the genome wide scans of DNA samples from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) provide a unique resource for evaluating the phenotypic effects of genetic variants underlying aging related genes, gene sets and for developing multivariable models that include behavioral, psychosocial, and genetic factors. This proposal aims to apply systems biologic and systems genetic methods for identifying gene sets based on existing gene expression, gene methylation, and multiple large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) underlying these genes will then be related to health, cognitive, behavioral, and economic phenotypes using multivariable regression-, machine learning-, and weighted network analysis approaches. An iterative process between SNP and phenotype selection facilitates the definition of clinically and economically important phenotypes under genetic control (reverse phenotyping). The proposal will not only elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of retirement relevant phenotypes (cognitive functioning, psychosocial factors, and health related expenditures) but also lead to a phenotypic annotation of aging related genes and pathways.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: State of the art statistical, computational, and network approaches for integrating genomic data with the valuable phenotypic and genetic data provided by the Health and Retirement Study is expected to lead to the identification of genetic markers relevant for improving the lives of America's older adults. Validated genetic markers will inform researchers in many fields including biomedical researchers, epidemiologists, psychologists, sociologists, and economists.            ",Systems genetic and reverse phenotypic analysis of age and retirement,8579754,R01AG042511,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Americas', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiologist', 'Expenditure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retirement', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'child depression', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'economic implication', 'endophenotype', 'exome', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'positional cloning', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'social implication', 'sociologist', 'statistics', 'text searching']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2013,315700,-0.003621732024818183
"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8251157,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,477069,0.011846624384468442
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.              Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at  risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential  biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,8459567,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,287765,0.021481123486252487
"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health.    Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD.

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                  ",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8545840,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2013,168632,-0.016497526290934962
"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden.

"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The PAGE study focuses on analysis of existing large samples of primarily non- European ancestry to broaden our understanding of the ethnic differences in the genetic basis of complex disease.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8535152,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2013,175392,-0.03002231252615565
"Enhanced Gene Identification in Complex Traits Using Kernel Machines DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped thousands of common trait-influencing variants yet the overwhelming majority of trait loci have yet to be discovered. The goal of this proposal is to develop and apply statistical approaches that move beyond the standard GWAS paradigm to map additional trait-influencing variation within the human genome. Most of our proposed tools are based on a flexible high-dimensional framework called kernel machine regression, which we have had past success employing for powerful gene mapping of complex traits in GWAS and next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. We believe the inherent flexibility of the kernel framework makes it ideal for exploring new paradigms in gene mapping of complex human traits. Aim 1 proposes novel kernel methods for integrated analysis of both single-nucleotide variation data (derived from GWAS and/or NGS) and genomic data (such as gene-expression and methylation patterns) that we believe will provide improved power for trait mapping. Aim 2 proposes novel kernel methods for large scale gene-gene interaction analysis across the genome, as well as a computational approach that enables efficient adjustment for multiple testing when applying such exhaustive testing procedures. Aim 3 establishes novel kernel methods for association mapping of SNVs on the X chromosome. The flexible nature of kernel machines makes it ideal for modeling potential sex-specific effects on this chromosome and the methods further can accommodate random X inactivation. Aim 4 proposes novel kernel approach for robust analysis of rare trait-influencing variation within families; such family-based designs are generally not considered in current rare-variant procedures. We will evaluate these methods on large-scale datasets that we are actively involved in and will implement the methods in user-friendly software for public distribution (Aim 5). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel and powerful statistical tools for identifying genetic loci acting independently or in conjunction with other genetic/environmental factors to influence complex human diseases or disease-related quantitative traits.

"Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning  Detecting Genome-Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning Epistasis is the interaction between two or more genes to affect phenotype. It is now widely accepted that epistasis plays an important role in susceptibility to many common diseases. The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled genome-wide association studies (GWAS or GWA studies). It is compelling that we be able to detect epistasis using GWAS data. However, so far GWA studies have mainly focused on the association of a single gene or loci with a disease. The crucial challenge to analyzing epistasis using GWAS data is finding a way to efficiently handle high-dimensional data sets. The only possible solution is to design efficient algorithms that allow us to find the most relevant epistasic relationships without doing an exhaustive investigation. To the Principal Investigator's knowledge, no current method can do this. This career award will investigate this problem. The specific aims are as follows: (Aim 1) develop and evaluate efficient Bayesian network-based methods for learning candidate genes associated with diseases from GWAS sets. Such genes would provide candidates for follow-up biological studies, (Aim 2) implement the methods in a pilot GWAS system for use by researchers when conducting a GWAS, (Aim 3) develop simulated genome-wide data sets and evaluate the pilot system using these data sets, and (Aim 4) conduct GWA studies concerning breast cancer and lung cancer. Aim 1 will be addressed by developing a succinct Bayesian network model representing epistasis, efficient algorithms which are tailored to investigating such models, integration of the algorithms into methods for learning epistasis, and using simulated datasets to test the effectiveness of the methods and compare their performance to other methods. Aim 2 will be met by implementing the methods in a pilot GWAS system. Aim 3 will be satisfied by developing synthetic data sets similar to those found in GWA studies, and using them to evaluate the system. Aim 4 will be achieved by conducting GWA studies concerning breast and lung cancer. By conducting these studies, we can (1) substantiate previous results concerning the genetic basis of these diseases; (2) possibly obtain interesting new findings pertaining to these diseases. The main hypothesis is that the proposed method will be an advance over existing methods in that it will make it computationally feasible to learn epistatic relationships from genome-wide data and it will therefore yield better discovery performance than existing methods.  Learning gene-gene interactions from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data is an important and challenging task in genetic epidemiology. This project will develop and evaluate a pilot GWAS system for performing this task. Advances obtained in analyzing GWAS data sets could enable us to learn the genetic basis of many diseases and thereby substantially improve the quality of personalized patient care.",Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning,8440362,R00LM010822,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Family history of', 'GAB2 gene', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Programming', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'network models']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2013,193848,-0.0057157859786745304
"Whole-Genome Prediction of Type-2 Diabetes Susceptibility in Various Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's career goal is to become a productive independent investigator in the area of statistical genetics, particularly in the area of genomic-based prediction of type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk. To meet this goal, the applicant proposes a career development plan that includes hands- on and didactic training in statistical learning as applied to quantitative genetics, categorical and case-control data analysis, informatics as applied to high dimensional genetic data, and the biology and genetics of T2D. A highly accomplished and diverse set of investigators with proven track records of successful mentoring will oversee the applicant's career development. The research component of this project seeks to improve our ability to use genetic information to predict an individual's risk of developing T2D Publically available genetic and phenotypic data from sources such as dbGaP (The database of Phenotypes and Genotypes) will be used to develop and test various models for prediction of T2D risk among three racial/ethnic groups. This project will capitalize on newly developed statistical methods that are able to incorporate information from tens of thousands of genetic markers at once, which represent a major advance over current methods that typically take fewer than 100 markers into account. The aims of the study are: 1) To test the hypothesis, in different populations, that individualized whole-genome prediction of T2D (along with standard covariates of sex, age, and BMI) will offer major improvements over current genetics-based prediction models, and will offer equal or greater accuracy than prediction based on family history; 2) To impute additional genetic markers to determine whether prediction can be improved, and to identify the subset of markers that is most useful in predicting T2D; 3) To develop prediction models for T2D risk given a certain body mass index (BMI), by including as predictors the interaction of BMI and genotypes. This project will greatly enhance our ability to predict an individual's susceptibility to T2D within various populations, leading to earlier and targeted prevention strategies, will increase our understanding of the genetic basis of T2D, and will provide critical training for Dr. Klimentidis' development as an independent scientist.      Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries. In this application, we propose to use state-of-the-art statistical methods that enable us to account for thousands of genetic variants simultaneously, in order to build and test predictive models for T2D susceptibility among individuals of European, Mexican, and African descent. This project has the potential to greatly improve prediction of T2D susceptibility in several ethnic groups, provide a better understanding of the specific genetic factors that play a role in T2D susceptibility, and ultimately bring us closer to the era of personalized medicine in which improved prediction ability results in earlier patient-oriented prevention and treatment.

"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.          Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response. To tackle these complex data types, we develop novel machine learning, network analysis, and database methods. Our personalized medicine approach will help researchers study and evaluate neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information.

"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases. We will then apply these new computational methods to identifying genetic biomarkers of bladder cancer in an epidemiological study from New Hampshire.",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,8324692,R01LM009012,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'New Hampshire', 'Predisposition', 'Research', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer type', 'combinatorial', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'population based', 'programs', 'statistics']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2012,369433,0.01608838769018489
"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,8205040,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SHH gene', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,364134,-0.011408963331282026
"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.        This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.

"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC) proposal aims to provide a flexible analysis resource for the ENCODE project. The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project. We will also provide quality assurance and summary metrics of genome-wide multiple alignments. This area has a number of complex statistical, algorithmic and engineering issues, which we will solve using state of the art techniques.

"Accelerating Curation of GWAS Catalog by Automatic Text Mining     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach to detecting genetic variations associated with particular diseases or traits by scanning markers across the genomes of a large-scale sample of subjects in a high-throughput manner. In less than a decade, GWAS studies have been successfully producing discovery and replication of many new disease loci. Discovered genetic associations have led to development of better strategies to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases. The number of GWAS is growing rapidly. There is a need for a database that allows researchers to easily query and search for previous results. A well-curated database also provides a resource for overview and summarization investigations of associated genetic sites and may help suggest pleiotropic genes. Such a database has been created and maintained by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), called ""A Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies"" (Catalog of GWAS). The catalog has led to interesting characterization of previous results in GWAS and NHGRI has continued to update and curate the catalog regularly. However, this is performed by manually extracting information from published GWAS articles. As a result, the coverage is low compared to the volume of all GWAS publications and would be impossible to catch up the pace of new publications. The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS. Our proposal is to use the curated data currently available from NHGRI as the training examples and apply novel machine-learning algorithms to train an information extractor to allow accurate automatic extraction. Given our recent success in applying machine learning to biological text mining, we are confident that this will lead to a useful tool to improve the productivity of curators and solve the coverage problem. Our first specific aim is to develop an accurate information extractor. Our second specific aim is to develop an easy-to-use curation tool for curators to efficiently check and correct errors from automatic information extraction so that their curation productivity can be improved by 18 folds. Then we will adapt the tool to extraction and curation of research papers reporting association studies using data from next generation sequencing. Currently, study design and the reporting of GWAS results using NGS data are not standardized. These results have not been considered to be included in the catalog yet. However, we expect that the limitations will be overcome and the methodology will converge soon. We will closely monitor the progress and adapt the tool to allow for inclusion of the NGS data. Finally, we will distribute the software to the public domain so that volunteers or interested parties can create their own catalog locally. It is our goal to share the developed software with the research community to advance the field. The new algorithms developed in this project and the entire development cycle, from design to deployment, will also contribute to the state-of-the- arts of biological text mining.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a new tool to automatically extract the information from research articles for the curation of the catalog of GWAS.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation of gene expression through variation in DNA methylation plays a critical role in a range of biological processes including cellular differentiation, human disease and cancer. New methods for determining the fine structure of methylation patterns genome-wide have led to an explosion of research in this field. Methylation near the gene promoter is correlated with gene silencing, while unmethylated promoters are potentially active. Current computational methods classify genes as either methylated and silenced or unmethylated and potentially active based on a coarse calculation of CpG methylation state across a window of a few hundred base pairs around the transcription start site. The detailed spatial pattern of methylation across the promoter may be an important determinant of gene expression, but current computational methods ignore this valuable information. Recent work has found regions proximal to CpG island promoters, dubbed ""CpG island shores"", whose methylation state correlates with transcription. CpG island shores are loosely defined, however, and this concept is difficult to apply in practice. While other methylation signatures are also likely to correlate with gene expression, a general framework to identify and study them has not been established. New computational tools for identification and correlation of detailed methylation patterns with gene expression are critical for advancing our understanding of the epigenetics of gene regulation. We propose to develop software tools to detect new methylation signatures at gene promoters that correlate with expression. This will be done within a formal framework so that these signatures can be used to determine differentially methylated genes in a variety of study designs. Taking advantage of the fact  that methylation over short ranges are highly correlated, we will interpolate methylation data at individual  CpG sites in a 10 kb window around the TSS to yield a methylation signature at each promoter that is  independent of primary sequence features. We will then use a metric from topology, the discrete Frechet distance, to calculate the similarity between methylation signatures, and apply this metric to cluster signatures of similar type. We will then determine clusters with methylation signatures that correlate with expression.  Clusters that contain both silenced and expressed genes will be examined to see if other local primary sequence features can be used to discriminate the genes based on expression. This approach will be used to detect methylation changes in case-control studies and in pairwise comparisons, such as needed for timecourse analysis or for the detection of different states of differentiation. The general framework developed here can be expanded in the future to examine methylation signatures at enhancers and gene bodies, as well as to histone marks or other genomic signals that carry detailed spatial information.          Narrative  DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, is an important  epigenetic regulator of gene expression in cells. DNA methylation has been implicated in a large number of  biological processes including cellular differentiation and cancer. We will develop software tools to analyze  data from new techniques for mapping DNA methylation genome-wide to discover new methylation signatures  that are associated with silenced and active genes. These will include tools to use these signatures to  determine what genes are differentially regulated in different cell types and in human disease.",A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS,8229567,R21LM011199,"['Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological Process', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG Islands', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Histones', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Metric', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'methyl group', 'promoter', 'research study', 'software development', 'spatial neglect', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2012,152000,-0.015349675990430014
"DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR JOINT GENE-ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key challenge for genetic analysis today is to account for the bulk of the phenotypic variance in complex traits that is attributable to genetic factors, but remains unexplained after multiple well-powered GWAS (Goldstein 2009; Hirschhorn 2009; Kraft and Hunter 2009). Many believe that systematically testing datasets for joint gene-environment effects (GxE) and gene-gene (GxG) effects will be essential in order to understand the genetics of complex phenotypes. However, the new era of high throughput, high-density genomic data (genotypes and sequencing) has given rise to serious computational and statistical challenges for the analysis of joint effects. The goal of this project is to develop effective strategies for the statistical analysis of joint-gene environment effects. The specific aims are to (1) identify strengths and weaknesses of multiple analytic approaches to joint GxE effects, and (2) develop new methods for coordinated meta-analysis. To accomplish Aim 1, we will systematically examine and compare traditional (e.g. regression based) and modern (e.g. partitioning, machine learning, information theoretic) analysis methods for case-control and quantitative phenotypes. The primary product will be specific guidance as to the conditions under which each method performs well. To accomplish Aim 2, we will extend recent joint-effects methods to a meta-analytic framework and develop improvements to currently used methods. For both aims, we will also analyze real data related to smoking, thereby improving our understanding of genetic and environmental contributors to smoking and addiction risk. These analyses of real data will be guided by bioinformatics-based variant prioritization. This study therefore will provide both guidance and tools needed to move the field of joint effects analysis forward. As a result, it will ultimately have a significant impact on our ability to account for the currently unexplained genetic contribution to phenotypic variance for complex traits.        Many diseases that greatly impact public health (such as heart disease, diabetes, and nicotine addiction) are the result of a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors. The purpose of this grant is to improve data analysis strategies (applicable to a wide variety of diseases) for the detection of joint effects of genes and environment. We will apply these methods to analyze existing data on smokers to improve our understanding of gene-environment effects on nicotine addiction.

"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world. Development of novel antimalarial strategies is urgently needed due to the rapid evolution and spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites Plasmodium. The long term goal of this proposed project is to develop a systems-level understanding of the molecular basis of parasitism, pathogenesis, and drug resistance. We will implement approaches that combine machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and genome-wide association analysis to develop more robust computational solutions and identify a comprehensive set of genes or gene products in biological networks that show an increase in genetic variability that can be associated with drug resistance, pathogenesis, virulence, responses to environmental challenges, or with other interesting phenotypes. The three specific aims are:  1. To identify network components using effective remote homology based methods. We will address a critical barrier in malaria research: our inability to assign functional annotation to over 60% of the predicted gene products in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. We will use a machine learning approach to detect evolutionarily conserved characteristics of the genes/proteins for network inference.  2. To infer the topology and dynamic interplay of cellular networks. Robust models will be developed to reconstruct the gene regulatory networks, signaling cascades and metabolic pathways that define the genetic basis for disease phenotypes.  3. To identify evolutionary signatures of network models by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  GWAS including Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) screening of multiple strains with varying phenotypes will serve as an effective means for high throughput wet-lab validations of networks in response to drug treatment. Such networks are the cornerstones of a systems-level view of pathogen biology, a view that will allow us to transform disparate types of data into biological insights for drug development.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases in the world today, infecting 300-500 million people yearly and resulting in 1-2 million deaths, primarily of young children.

While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.        While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to quickly identify data sets of interest, expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate test incorporating multiple phenotypes, and perform larger meta-analyses easily by honing in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest with increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.

"Statistical Modeling of Complex Traits in Genetic Reference Super-Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding the heritable architecture of medically relevant phenotypes. Traditionally, such crosses have tended to be on a small scale with either limited power to detect genetic effects or limited resolution to localize causal variants. Recently, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, have spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Genetic Resource Populations (GRPs) use economies of scale to provide cost-effective and replicable platforms for genetic studies. This project concerns the largest, most ambitious GRP in mouse genetics to date, the Collaborative Cross (CC), and a series of crosses and designs related to or derived from it: the Diversity Outbred (DO) cross, the CC Recombinant Inbred Cross (CC-RIX) and the diallel. Experiments on each separate cross provide distinct information about the heritable architecture of a target complex disease. In combination, this Genetic Reference Super-Population (GRSP) potentially provides an unparalleled basis for cross-study replication and integration in mouse genetics. This project aims to develop statistical methods that advance the current state of complex trait analysis of these populations separately, and, by exploiting the unique structure that connects them, proposes to develop a statistical framework that allows for their joint use.  Aim 1 develops a Bayesian probabilistic framework for haplotype-based analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Aim 1a develops a statistical software module for flexible haplotype-based analysis, which can be ex- tended by the researcher to model a rich variety of designs and disease types. Aim 1b will adapt machine learning techniques to provide posterior inference of the allelic series of a QTL. Aim 1c will incorporate Bayesian modeling of polygenic effects.  Aim 2 and 3 concern joint analysis, building on the foundation set by Aim 1. Aim 2 develops methods to optimize experimental design of follow-up studies in one population given results from another. Aim 2a uses the diallel to inform design of CC/CC-RIX/DO experiments. Aim 2b uses partial data on CC/CC-RIX/DO to guide collection of additional data. Aim 3 explores models for jointly analyzing multiple populations in the GRSP, using complementary datasets to stabilize analysis at single QTL (Aim 3a) and across multiple QTL (Aim 3b).  These aims address specific and persistent challenges in the cost-effective design and efficient analysis of multiparent genetic data, in particular the CC, DO, CC-RIX and diallel. The project will generate tools useful for a wide range of model organism crosses and can be applied to the genetic study of any complex disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on animal models of human disease.

"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes. One approach to studying multigenic interactions is to introduce combinations of mutations in model organisms and observe how they affect the cell.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.              Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at  risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential  biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,8246510,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,306133,0.021481123486252487
"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health.    Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics.    Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables.    Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.

"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk.

"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response.

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one. Affecting more than one in five Americans annually, internalizing disorders (IDs) (i.e.,  depression and anxiety) are the most common forms of mental illness and leading  causes of the global health burden. Clearly, an improved understanding of the etiology of  IDs would substantially advance both prevention and intervention efforts.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,8242887,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2012,769079,-0.009601229415056419
"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for visual diseases.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.                  The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.                ",Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics,8264613,R01EY022300,"['Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2012,322000,-0.03465171583743724

"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. This proposal utilizes a fusion of genomic analysis of a large population of patients, mathematical modeling and culture of intestinal fragments to functionally identify genes that are critical for colon cancer development.

Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8308347,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2012,175392,-0.03002231252615565
"Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning  Detecting Genome-Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning Epistasis is the interaction between two or more genes to affect phenotype. It is now widely accepted that epistasis plays an important role in susceptibility to many common diseases. The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled genome-wide association studies (GWAS or GWA studies). It is compelling that we be able to detect epistasis using GWAS data. However, so far GWA studies have mainly focused on the association of a single gene or loci with a disease. The crucial challenge to analyzing epistasis using GWAS data is finding a way to efficiently handle high-dimensional data sets. The only possible solution is to design efficient algorithms that allow us to find the most relevant epistasic relationships without doing an exhaustive investigation. To the Principal Investigator's knowledge, no current method can do this. This career award will investigate this problem. The specific aims are as follows: (Aim 1) develop and evaluate efficient Bayesian network-based methods for learning candidate genes associated with diseases from GWAS sets. Such genes would provide candidates for follow-up biological studies, (Aim 2) implement the methods in a pilot GWAS system for use by researchers when conducting a GWAS, (Aim 3) develop simulated genome-wide data sets and evaluate the pilot system using these data sets, and (Aim 4) conduct GWA studies concerning breast cancer and lung cancer. Aim 1 will be addressed by developing a succinct Bayesian network model representing epistasis, efficient algorithms which are tailored to investigating such models, integration of the algorithms into methods for learning epistasis, and using simulated datasets to test the effectiveness of the methods and compare their performance to other methods. Aim 2 will be met by implementing the methods in a pilot GWAS system. Aim 3 will be satisfied by developing synthetic data sets similar to those found in GWA studies, and using them to evaluate the system. Aim 4 will be achieved by conducting GWA studies concerning breast and lung cancer. By conducting these studies, we can (1) substantiate previous results concerning the genetic basis of these diseases; (2) possibly obtain interesting new findings pertaining to these diseases. The main hypothesis is that the proposed method will be an advance over existing methods in that it will make it computationally feasible to learn epistatic relationships from genome-wide data and it will therefore yield better discovery performance than existing methods.  Learning gene-gene interactions from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data is an important and challenging task in genetic epidemiology. This project will develop and evaluate a pilot GWAS system for performing this task. Advances obtained in analyzing GWAS data sets could enable us to learn the genetic basis of many diseases and thereby substantially improve the quality of personalized patient care.",Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning,8372706,R00LM010822,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Family history of', 'GAB2 gene', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Programming', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'network models']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2012,166150,-0.0057157859786745304
"Whole-Genome Prediction of Type-2 Diabetes Susceptibility in Various Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's career goal is to become a productive independent investigator in the area of statistical genetics, particularly in the area of genomic-based prediction of type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk. To meet this goal, the applicant proposes a career development plan that includes hands- on and didactic training in statistical learning as applied to quantitative genetics, categorical and case-control data analysis, informatics as applied to high dimensional genetic data, and the biology and genetics of T2D. A highly accomplished and diverse set of investigators with proven track records of successful mentoring will oversee the applicant's career development. The research component of this project seeks to improve our ability to use genetic information to predict an individual's risk of developing T2D Publically available genetic and phenotypic data from sources such as dbGaP (The database of Phenotypes and Genotypes) will be used to develop and test various models for prediction of T2D risk among three racial/ethnic groups. This project will capitalize on newly developed statistical methods that are able to incorporate information from tens of thousands of genetic markers at once, which represent a major advance over current methods that typically take fewer than 100 markers into account. The aims of the study are: 1) To test the hypothesis, in different populations, that individualized whole-genome prediction of T2D (along with standard covariates of sex, age, and BMI) will offer major improvements over current genetics-based prediction models, and will offer equal or greater accuracy than prediction based on family history; 2) To impute additional genetic markers to determine whether prediction can be improved, and to identify the subset of markers that is most useful in predicting T2D; 3) To develop prediction models for T2D risk given a certain body mass index (BMI), by including as predictors the interaction of BMI and genotypes. This project will greatly enhance our ability to predict an individual's susceptibility to T2D within various populations, leading to earlier and targeted prevention strategies, will increase our understanding of the genetic basis of T2D, and will provide critical training for Dr. Klimentidis' development as an independent scientist.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries. In this application, we propose to use state-of-the-art statistical methods that enable us to account for thousands of genetic variants simultaneously, in order to build and test predictive models for T2D susceptibility among individuals of European, Mexican, and African descent. This project has the potential to greatly improve prediction of T2D susceptibility in several ethnic groups, provide a better understanding of the specific genetic factors that play a role in T2D susceptibility, and ultimately bring us closer to the era of personalized medicine in which improved prediction ability results in earlier patient-oriented prevention and treatment.              Genetic factors are known to play a substantial role in the etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D), which is a growing health challenge facing developed and developing countries.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information. This project will develop methods to identify diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations,8042010,R01LM010685,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Blood specimen', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Enrollment', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'research clinical testing', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,336864,-0.004591528958875217
"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis. The success of this project will be important in bridging statistical machine learning and cancer research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This project aims to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems, especially for problems with high dimensional and noisy data such as gene expression data.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases.

"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,8004929,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SHH gene', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,353329,-0.011408963331282026
"New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With recent biotechnology advances, biomedical investigations have become computationally more complex and more challenging, involving high-dimensional structured data collected at a genomic scale. To respond to the pressing need to analyze such high-dimensional data, the research team proposes to develop powerful statistical and computational tools to model and infer condition-specific gene networks through sparse and structured learning of multiple precision matrices, as for time-varying gene network analyses with microarray data. The approach will be generalized to regression analysis with covariates and to mixture models with phenotype heterogeneity, e.g., unknown disease subtypes.  Statistically, the team will investigate novel penalization or regularization approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency of estimating multiple large precision matrices describing pairwise partial correlations in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models. Computationally, innovative strategies will be explored based on the state-of-the art optimization techniques, particularly difference convex programming, augmented Lagrangian method, and the method of coordinate decent. Specific aims include: a) developing computational tools for inferring multiple precision matrices, especially when the size of a matrix greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing regression approaches for sparse as well as structured learning to associate partial correlations with covariates of interest; c) developing mixture models to infer gene disregulations in the presence of unknown disease subtypes, and to discover novel disease subtypes; d) applying the developed methods to analyze two microarray datasets for i) inference of condition-specific gene networks for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for human endothelial cells; e) developing public-domain software.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.           This proposed research is expected not only to contribute valuable analysis tools for the elucidation of condition-specific gene networks, but also to advance statistical methodology and theory in Gaussian graphical models and Gaussian mixture models for high-dimensional data.         ",New Machine Learning Tools for Biomedical Data,8101478,R01GM081535,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Escherichia coli', 'Floods', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Group Structure', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Phenotype', 'Public Domains', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'disorder subtype', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'programs', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2011,290523,-0.000327154340161635
"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC) proposal aims to provide a flexible analysis resource for the ENCODE project. The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project. We will also provide quality assurance and summary metrics of genome-wide multiple alignments. This area has a number of complex statistical, algorithmic and engineering issues, which we will solve using state of the art techniques.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR JOINT GENE-ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key challenge for genetic analysis today is to account for the bulk of the phenotypic variance in complex traits that is attributable to genetic factors, but remains unexplained after multiple well-powered GWAS (Goldstein 2009; Hirschhorn 2009; Kraft and Hunter 2009). Many believe that systematically testing datasets for joint gene-environment effects (GxE) and gene-gene (GxG) effects will be essential in order to understand the genetics of complex phenotypes. However, the new era of high throughput, high-density genomic data (genotypes and sequencing) has given rise to serious computational and statistical challenges for the analysis of joint effects. The goal of this project is to develop effective strategies for the statistical analysis of joint-gene environment effects. The specific aims are to (1) identify strengths and weaknesses of multiple analytic approaches to joint GxE effects, and (2) develop new methods for coordinated meta-analysis. To accomplish Aim 1, we will systematically examine and compare traditional (e.g. regression based) and modern (e.g. partitioning, machine learning, information theoretic) analysis methods for case-control and quantitative phenotypes. The primary product will be specific guidance as to the conditions under which each method performs well. To accomplish Aim 2, we will extend recent joint-effects methods to a meta-analytic framework and develop improvements to currently used methods. For both aims, we will also analyze real data related to smoking, thereby improving our understanding of genetic and environmental contributors to smoking and addiction risk. These analyses of real data will be guided by bioinformatics-based variant prioritization. This study therefore will provide both guidance and tools needed to move the field of joint effects analysis forward. As a result, it will ultimately have a significant impact on our ability to account for the currently unexplained genetic contribution to phenotypic variance for complex traits.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many diseases that greatly impact public health (such as heart disease, diabetes, and nicotine addiction) are the result of a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors. The purpose of this grant is to improve data analysis strategies (applicable to a wide variety of diseases) for the detection of joint effects of genes and environment. We will apply these methods to analyze existing data on smokers to improve our understanding of gene-environment effects on nicotine addiction.              Many diseases that greatly impact public health (such as heart disease, diabetes, and nicotine addiction) are the result of a complex interplay between genes and environmental factors.

"Information Explorer: a Suite of Tools for Cross-study Genetic Loci Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Databases such as dbGaP represent extremely valuable resources of data that have been assembled across multiple cohorts. The increasing development of cost-effective high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies are resulting in vast amounts of genetic data. While such databases were formed in order to archive and distribute the results of previously performed genetic association analyses, an increasing number of studies have provided de-identified individual-level genotypic and phenotypic data that are made available to outside researchers who have obtained the appropriate authorization. While the amount of data made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies. Many genetic epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease have multiple variables related to any given phenotype, resulting from different definitions and multiple measurements or subsets of data. A researcher searching such databases for the availability of phenotype and genotype combinations is confronted with a veritable mountain of variables to sift through. This often requires visiting multiple websites to gain additional information about variables that are listed on databases, and examination of data distributions to assess similarities across cohorts. While the naming strategy for genetic variants is largely standardized across studies (e.g. ""rs"" numbers for single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), this is often not the case for phenotype variables. For a given study, there are often numerous versions of phenotypic variables. Researchers currently have to analyze and compare increasingly larger numbers of variables that have varying degrees of documentation associated with them to obtain the desired information. This is a time-consuming process that may still miss the most appropriate variables. Moreover, every researcher that wants to compare the same datasets often needs to start from scratch since there are no tools to share the phenotype comparison results. The availability of informatic tools to make phenotype mapping more efficient and improve its accuracy, along with intuitive phenotype query tools, would provide a major resource for researchers utilizing these databases. The tools we are proposing would allow researchers to (1) Quickly obtain the information needed to assess whether a specific study will be useful for the hypothesis of interest; (2) Exclude variables that do not meet research criteria; (3) Ascertain which studies have combinations of phenotype and genetic information of interest; and (4) More easily expand research questions beyond the most basic main-effects to more complex analyses such as gene-by-environment interactions and multivariate tests incorporating multiple phenotypes. The increased utility will also enable larger meta-analyses to be performed, as researchers will be able to more quickly hone in on outcomes, exclusionary variables and covariates of interest, leading to increased statistical power to detect genetic associations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the amount of genomic data (e.g., GWAS, sequencing, etc.) made available has increased dramatically in recent years, relatively little has been done in order to facilitate phenotype harmonization across studies.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8054816,R01GM087694,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'disorder control', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'phenome', 'trait']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,513100,0.011846624384468442
"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes. One approach to studying multigenic interactions is to introduce combinations of mutations in model organisms and observe how they affect the cell.

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health. Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables. Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Integrating Genomic and Environmental Perspectives on Internalizing Disorders While biometric genetic studies have long indicated substantial heritability for internalizing disorders, including major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders, progress in mapping this influence onto specific genetic variants has been slow. Expert consensus suggests that finding this ¿missing heritability¿ will require moving beyond the current ¿one SNP at a time¿ genomewide association study (GWAS) paradigm to develop interactive models jointly considering effects across structural and functional genomic units (e.g., genes and biological pathways), as well as modeling gene-environmental interaction (GxE) in the highly dimensional GWAS context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate the training and research opportunities necessary to advance such an interactive model of internalizing disorder etiology, thus supporting the candidate¿s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the area. General training goals include building proficiency in statistical genetics and bioinformatics, and strengthening knowledge of substantive issues in developmental psychopathology and psychometric statistical modeling/programming. The candidate proposes to acquire a number of specific skills, including data integration techniques for including prior information in GWAS, aggregation methods to capture the possible effects of many markers with very small effects (e.g., gene-based, pathway-based, and polygenic ¿risk profile¿ score analyses) and machine learning applications for investigating epistasis and nonlinear genomic effects. Proposed training in these areas consists of an interlocking program of coursework, intensive mentoring, summer programs, reading groups, seminar series and conferences, with special attention to training in research ethics. Direct mentoring is a key feature of this program, with access to leading experts in each of the proposed training areas (i.e., Drs. Edwin van den Oord and Patrick Sullivan ¿ statistical genetics and bioinformatics, Dr. E. Jane Costello ¿ developmental psychopathology, and Dr. Michael Neale ¿ statistical modeling and programming) representing a core strength of the proposed training plan. The candidate proposes to apply acquired skills in the research portion of the project by conducting a multistage GWAS to investigate genomic influence, both direct and in interaction with environmental risk factors, on developmental trajectories of internalizing disorders. Methodologically, this approach focuses on integrating longitudinal statistical models of phenotypic development and environmental risk with emerging genomic methods. This will be facilitated by bringing together an unprecedented combination of longitudinal GWAS datasets, including a meta-analysis of the four Duke/VCU samples of the Gene, Environment, and Development Initiative (GEDI) (N=3,623). This ¿discovery¿ phase meta-analysis will then be followed by replication in two large independent longitudinal samples¿the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=~12,000) and the Minnesota Twin and Family Study (N=3,762). The exceptional statistical power of this design will be further complimented in a final analytical stage, with next-generation sequencing follow-up using targeted capture methods to extract promising genes/regions and extreme-trait methods to maximize power by selecting subjects from the extremes of the phenotypic distributions. The institutional environment provided by the Virginia Commonwealth University Center for Biomarker Research and Personalized Medicine (CBRPM) represents another core asset to the candidate¿s career development. The CBRPM¿s mission is to develop and apply novel methods for the purpose of identifying and using biomarkers to improve disease understanding and medical treatment. The Center operates from a strong multidisciplinary perspective with primary applications involving psychiatric outcomes, developmental psychopathology, and substance use disorders. Currently funded research programs at the CBRPM include serving as the data analysis core of the Duke/VCU GEDI project, method development in the design and analysis of adaptive multistage GWAS, a replication study of findings from schizophrenia GWAS, and whole genome profiling to detect schizophrenia methylation markers. These projects offer an ideal context for executing the proposed training and research, as they provide an environment focused on GWAS and next-generation sequencing applications to psychiatric disorders¿central topics of the candidate¿s career development plan. The CBRPM also provides several unique physical resources supporting the current proposal, including a SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencer, which will allow follow-up sequencing to be done in-house, and a Center-dedicated computing cluster, facilitating the computationally intensive analyses proposed. In addition to physical resources, the CBRPM offers a challenging and collegial intellectual environment that promotes collaboration both within and outside of the Center. In sum, the CBRPM provides a stimulating and supportive institutional environment with the all of the statistical, computational and laboratory resources necessary to make this proposal a successful one.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.            The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,8054297,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2011,669490,-0.009601229415056419
"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability. We are using Legionella pneumophila, a related bacterium with pathogenic strategies predicted to be conserved, to identify and characterize critical transport determinants on virulence factors. This work will lead to the identification of a new catalog of virulence factors associated with establishment of Q fever, and provide novel targets for antimicrobial development              RELEVANCE STATEMENT The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability.

"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics.

"Integrated Genomic Discovery and Functional Validation of Colorectal Cancer Loci    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) arises from multiple mutations and genomic aberrations in distinct driver cancer genes that that in concert to spur neoplastic development and phenotype. This inherent genetic complexity greatly complicates both personalized diagnosis and treatment. Previously published studies have confined that large numbers of genes will be mutated or subject to genomic aberrations in CRC. A significant and emerging challenge for the post-genomic era is to identify which of these mutated genes are ""driver"" loci that functionally drive colon cancer development, versus ""passenger"" loci without functional relevance. Finally, it is of the highest priority that one forges these genetic observations with correlations of prognosis and clinical outcome. This can only be done if we better understand the unified biological ramifications of the combined and diverse multigenic driver background which act synergistically to promote CRC tumorigenesis. This proposal details an integrated analysis that will rely on the CRC genomic data generated by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) to discover novel candidate CRC genes and study multigenic CRC driver gene co-mutated / dysregulated modules within the genetic context of other drivers and provide biological validation in a powerful in vitro primary culture CRC model which can be engineered for multiple genetic events.  To accomplish these goals, we will develop and implement novel statistical methodologies for the integrative analysis of multiple TCGA genomic and clinical data sets. The goal is to identify and prioritize novel CRC genes either singly or as co-mutated modules in combination with other known ""driver"" CRC genes. We will use the rich TCGA data set to conduct an integrated CRC genomic analysis of point mutations, gene expression, copy number aberrations and methylation data. We will prioritize the discovery of mutations and other genomic aberrations of these novel CRC genes that are associated with specific clinical stages of disease and other clinical parameters.  These statistical and computational studies will then be directly coupled to rapid and robust functional target validation of candidate loci using our rigorously characterized in vitro primary intestinal culture methodology (Gotani et al, Nature Medicine, 2009), in which we have recently established the transforming activity of established CRC loci such as APC, KRAS and TP53. Genetic deletion and retroviral expression of shRNA, cDNA or mutants thereof will be utilized to evaluate putative individual driver loci, as well as combinatorial oncogene modules. This proposal directly addresses fundamental problems in the exploration and translation of novel colorectal cancer gene discovery in the context of clinical data which is available from TCGA. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

High-dimensional data have emerged rapidly in recent years due to the advance of high-throughput 'omics technologies, e.g, in Genome- Wide Association Studies (GWAS), and genome-wide epigenetic (DNA methylation) studies. Massive next generation sequencing data are soon available. There is an urgent need to develop advanced stati stical and computational methods for analyzing such high throughput 'omics data in observational studies and clinical trials. We propose to develop statistical and computational methods for analysis of (1) genome-wide association studies; (2) sequencing data for studying rare variant effects; (3) genome-wide DNA methylation studies; (4) gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. We will develop methods for both case-control studies and cohort studies, such as longitudinal studies and survival studies. We will study the theoretical properties of the proposed methods and evaluate the finite s ample performance using simulation studies. We will develop efficient numerical algorithms and user-friendly statistical software, and disseminate these tools to health sciences researchers. In collaboration with biomedical investigators, we will apply the proposed models methods to data from several genome-wide epidemiological studies in cancer and other chronic diseases. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Development of new statistical methods for analysis of correlated and high-dimensional data will provide  powerful analytic tools to advance 'omics research in observational studies and clinical trials and to help  understand the roles of genes, gene products, and the environment in causing human diseases.",Statistical Methods for Correlated and High-Dimensional Biomedical Data,8117858,R37CA076404,"['Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biomedical Research', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Explosion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Human Genome', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Prevention strategy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'epigenomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'health science research', 'high throughput analysis', 'human disease', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R37,2011,308344,0.013279996066504384
"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative/Relevance We will develop computational tools for analyzing complex associations between images, genotype and clinical phenotype. The tools will be user-friendly and freely available, and will potentially facilitate accurate early diagnosis and prognosis of mental disorders such as Alzheimer's.             n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8165447,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2011,175392,-0.030198230667532983
"Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Epistasis is the interaction between two or more genes to affect phenotype. It is now widely accepted that epistasis plays an important role in susceptibility to many common diseases. The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled genome-wide association studies (GWAS or GWA studies). It is compelling that we be able to detect epistasis using GWAS data. However, so far GWA studies have mainly focused on the association of a single gene or loci with a disease. The crucial challenge to analyzing epistasis using GWAS data is finding a way to efficiently handle high-dimensional data sets. The only possible solution is to design efficient algorithms that allow us to find the most relevant epistasic relationships without doing an exhaustive investigation. To the Principal Investigator's knowledge, no current method can do this.       This career award will investigate this problem. The specific aims are as follows: (Aim 1) develop and evaluate efficient Bayesian network-based methods for learning candidate genes associated with diseases from GWAS sets. Such genes would provide candidates for follow-up biological studies, (Aim 2) implement the methods in a pilot GWAS system for use by researchers when conducting a GWAS, (Aim 3) develop simulated genome-wide data sets and evaluate the pilot system using these data sets, and (Aim 4) conduct GWA studies concerning breast cancer and lung cancer.       Aim 1 will be addressed by developing a succinct Bayesian network model representing epistasis, efficient algorithms which are tailored to investigating such models, integration of the algorithms into methods for learning epistasis, and using simulated datasets to test the effectiveness of the methods and compare their performance to other methods. Aim 2 will be met by implementing the methods in a pilot GWAS system. Aim 3 will be satisfied by developing synthetic data sets similar to those found in GWA studies, and using them to evaluate the system. Aim 4 will be achieved by conducting GWA studies concerning breast and lung cancer. By conducting these studies, we can (1) substantiate previous results concerning the genetic basis of these diseases; (2) possibly obtain interesting new findings pertaining to these diseases.       The main hypothesis is that the proposed method will be an advance over existing methods in that it will make it computationally feasible to learn epistatic relationships from genome-wide data and it will therefore yield better discovery performance than existing methods.              Learning gene-gene interactions from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data is an important and challenging task in genetic epidemiology. This project will develop and evaluate a pilot GWAS system for performing this task. Advances obtained in analyzing GWAS data sets could enable us to learn the genetic basis of many diseases and thereby substantially improve the quality of personalized patient care.",Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning,8145599,K99LM010822,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Family history of', 'GAB2 gene', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Programming', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'network models']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2011,90000,-0.006487055042030522
"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.            There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors.

"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace.

"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,7763788,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,361911,-0.011408963331282026
"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC) proposal aims to provide a flexible analysis resource for the ENCODE project. The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project. We will also provide quality assurance and summary metrics of genome-wide multiple alignments.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7930715,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,288566,-0.0235640889639139

"Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic variants and environmental factors interacting in a composite and potentially nonlinear manner. Although the genome-wide views provided by advanced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays present an opportunity to discover previously unrecognized genomic patterns, the ability to recognize such complex features of genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association study to discover genetic determinants of health and disease from massive genomic data. The focus of this application is the development and validation of effective computational statistics approaches to detect complex interaction effects of multi-locus SNPs which could be useful for classification and prediction of disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of complex phenotypes. Based on very promising preliminary studies, the specific aims of this R21 application are carefully designed: (1) to refine and evaluate the recently developed significant conditional association (SCA) criterion and heuristic combinatorial interaction growing (HCIG) search strategy (specifically designed to discover complex interaction effects of multi-locus jointly-predictive SNPs), test and validate on real SNP based realistic simulations and compare with a panel of most relevant existing methods; and (2) to apply SCA- HCIG method to the real SNP data of NIAMS-funded FMS cohort in relationship to metabolic syndrome etc. and develop SNP marker based classification/ prediction models, assessed by the prediction power and initial biological plausibility of the implicated SNP subsets. This proposal represents a unique cross-disciplinary collaboration focusing on the development of new analytical methods to more effectively identify interacting susceptibility SNPs and environmental factors that can be used to determine individual risk to a specific disease and to estimate prognosis and response to treatment. The results could also suggest novel preventive intervetions and therapeutic targets, reduce the burden of diseases, and accelerate the realization of truly personalized medicine.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Wang, Yue (Joseph), Ph.D. Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects Project Narrative  Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic and environmental factors.

"Computational Strategies for Quantitative Mapping of Genetic Interaction Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies suggest that many diseases, particularly those that commonly afflict our population, result from interactions among multiple alleles. In an attempt to understand these complex phenotypes, recent experimental efforts in model organisms have focused on measuring such interactions by engineering combinatorial genetic perturbations. Due to the enormous space of possible mutants, brute-force experimental investigation is simply not feasible, and thus, there is a critical need for computational strategies for intelligent exploration of genetic interaction networks. The specific objective of this application is to develop a computational framework for leveraging the existing genomic or proteomic data to enable intelligent direction of combinatorial perturbation studies. The rationale for the proposed research is that although current knowledge of genetic interactions is sparse, the integration of existing genomic and proteomic data can enable the inference of network models that suggest promising candidates for high-throughput interaction screens. Using such computational guidance should enable more efficient characterization of network structure, and ultimately, better understanding of how genes contribute to complex phenotypes.  Based on strong findings in preliminary studies, this objective will be accomplished through two specific aims: (1) development of critical normalization methods and quantitative models for colony array-based interaction assays, and (2) novel machine learning-based approaches for iterative model refinement and optimal interaction screen selection.  The proposed research is innovative because it would represent one of the first efforts to couple genomic data integration and network inference technology with a large-scale experimental effort, where several months of experimental investigation are based entirely on computational direction. Such an approach will yield insight into how combinatorial perturbations can be used to characterize global modularity and organization, and more generally, would serve as a prototype for hybrid computational-experimental strategies in other genomic contexts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many common diseases result from interactions among multiple genes.

"Multi-point and multi-locus analysis of genomic association data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a new and powerful approach to investigate the effect of inherited genetic variation on risks of complex diseases. With recent advances in genotyping technology, genome-wide association studies are now becoming a reality. Data from GWAS are expected in an accelerated rate. Despite tremendous efforts in developing efficient algorithms for mapping complex diseases/traits, single-locus based approaches are still the primary method for GWAS. However, it is known that usually multiple genetic factors, environmental factors as well as their interactions play an important role in the etiology of complex diseases. Novel and practical approaches to simultaneously model multiple variables and their interactions from hundreds of thousands single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are greatly needed. In this project, we propose to develop efficient algorithms and practical statistical tools to address two important problems in the context of genome- wide association studies: multi-point analysis and multi-locus analysis. For multi-point analysis, our Dynamic Hidden Chain Markov Model (DHCMM) can jointly model historical recombination and muta- tions, haplotype structures and frequencies, and associations, which is expected to be more effective than existing approaches. For multi-locus analysis, we propose to use an advanced machine learning approach to jointly screen SNPs that are predictive of diseases. Our integrated software system MAVEN will facilitate management, analysis, visualization and results sharing of GWA data using cut- ting edge technologies.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.          Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome.

"Genetics of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Subtypes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune arthropathy characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues. It is a debilitating disorder in which progressive joint damage and resulting growth disorders may occur. It is the most common chronic childhood rheumatic disease in the Western world. There are at least seven subtypes that comprise JIA and these subtypes clearly differ by age of onset and gender. JIA has a strong genetic influence with sibling risk ratios of approximately 20 (S=20). However, genetic influences vary by subtypes, age of onset and gender. We propose to analyze existing genome-wide association (GWA) data on 800 JIA cases and greater than 3,000 controls of European ancestry and genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K and Affymetrix 6.0 platforms for targeted hypotheses beyond the current case:control study. We hypothesize that loci contributing to the risk of JIA can be identified through contrasting and partitioning into more homogeneous subtypes of JIA and testing for the modifying effects on these loci's risks through interactions with HLA polymorphisms, age of onset and gender. We propose to identify genetic factors of JIA via 1) the use of imputation methods to test for association with JIA and subtypes for all HapMap SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 2%; 2) computing GWA analysis for age of onset, SNP-by-gender interaction, SNP-by-HLA interaction and SNP-by-SNP interactions; 3) identifying regions of loss of heterozygosity and copy number variation predictive of JIA and its subtypes; and 4) computing GWA for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in individuals with both Affymetrix 6.0 and existing global gene expression data. The proposal includes well powered GWA analyses for JIA, novel methods such as statistical machine learning for interaction analyses, and integration of expression and genotype data. The proposed series of analyses will assist in our long- term goal of understanding JIA, while recognizing the diversity of conditions known as JIA and making the discoveries of greater relevance for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues.

"A National Consortium to Explore the Genotypic Basis for ESRD in Lupus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End stage renal disease (ESRD), one of the most serious and costly complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), occurs in a sub-set of patients with SLE-related renal involvement. Factors predisposing to ESRD presumably include both genetics and environmental factors, and there is unequivocal evidence that ESRD disproportionately affects lupus persons of African American descent. Data in SLE-related ESRD suggest that at least two genetic factors, -- certain allelic variants of the genes FCGR3A and MYH9, -- contribute to ESRD risk. However, two genes alone do not define the scope of genetic risk for ESRD. Therefore, building on our precedent data for genetic contributions, it is timely to undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the genetic risk factors for ESRD in European American (EA) and African Americans (AA) with lupus nephritis (LN/ESRD). Until now, two major barriers have precluded such a study. Technical limitations in genotyping platform and coverage have been overcome with the Illumina Human Omni- 1 Quad BeadChip. To surmount the second barrier of limited study populations, we have assembled an unprecedented team of rheumatologists, nephrologists and statistical geneticists with IRB protocols active, the clinical studies infrastructure in place and the patient collections and clinical data more than 75% in hand. Thus (1) Our first aim is to characterize the genetic susceptibility factors associated with ESRD by performing a  GWAS with 800 EA LN/ESRD and 800 AA LN/ESRD compared to lupus subjects of each ethnicity but  without nephritis and normal control subjects.  (2) We propose that [gene x gene] and [gene x environment] interactions are biologically important and may be more easily detectable using the machine learning and more modern likelihood-based approaches. Therefore, our second aim is to apply novel approaches to gene discovery and biological pathway characterization including Bayesian networks, alternative decision trees, HyperLasso, and penalized logistic regression.  (3) Finally, our third aim is to build an essential resource, consistent with NIH specimen and data sharing guidelines and supported by the institution. This resource will enable follow-up studies in fine-mapping, deep-sequencing, SNP identification, pathway analysis and methods development. Our consortium leverages current resources and investments by NIAMS, NIDDK, NIEHS, NCRR, CDCP and private foundations to create a unique opportunity to address a major health care challenge. We have a substantial head start, drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, and are poised to identify genetic risk factors, leading to strategies for ESRD reduction, which would enable substantial cost savings and reduction in morbidity and mortality as it reduces ethnic disparities in health outcomes.           7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, this study is uniquely positioned to capitalize on a multidisciplinary team to leverage existing resources to address important questions about the underlying genetic influences on susceptibility to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in lupus. This understanding may lead to strategies for ESRD intervention, may reduce ethnic disparities in health outcome, and may enable substantial cost savings in the health care industry.

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Predictive Modeling with Clinical and Genomic Data in COPD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Dr. Peter Castaldi is a physician completing a period of F32-funded support. On July 1st, 2009 he will begin a full-time position at Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies (ICRHPS). This position involves a 25% clinical commitment. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of COPD and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His particular interests are genetic meta-analysis, gene-environment interaction, and predictive modeling with regression-based and machine-learning methods.  His immediate goals are 1.) to identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and COPD- related phenotypes through the combined analysis of multiple genome-wide association (GWA) studies, 2.) to identify epistatic and gene-by-smoking interactions, and 3.) to develop accurate predictive models in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using clinical and genomic information. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in bioinformatics. His vision for achieving this goal involves developing expertise in bioinformatics so as to be able to participate in and eventually lead multidisciplinary teams in the application of computational methods to genomic datasets in order to answer important clinical questions that will improve the care of patients and population health. Environment: Dr. Castaldi will receive training in a rich, interdisciplinary environment. His principal mentor, Dr. Joseph Lau, is the head of the Center for Clinical Evidence Synthesis in the ICRHPS, and he is a worldwide leader in the field of meta-analysis and evidence synthesis. At Tufts, in addition to regular meetings with Dr. Lau, Peter will receive training in genetic evidence synthesis from leaders in the field, including Drs. John Ioannidis and Tom Trikalinos. The co-mentor of this application, Dr. Edwin Silverman, is a leading researcher in COPD genetics at the Channing Laboratory. At the Channing Laboratory, Peter will receive excellent training in respiratory genetics and genetic epidemiology, and he will have resources to state of the art high-throughput genotyping, next-generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics support. Dr. Castaldi will also continue his collaboration with Dr. Donna Slonim in the Tufts Computer Science Department, who will provide assistance with application of computational algorithms to genomic data and guidance as Dr. Castaldi continues to build a practical and theoretical foundation in Bioinformatics. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. While the principal risk factor for COPD, smoking, is well-established, there is variable susceptibility in the general population to the lung damage caused by cigarette smoke. There is strong evidence supporting a genetic component to COPD susceptibility. Understanding how genes and environment interact to produce clinical COPD will allow for more accurate diagnostic tools and open new avenues of investigation for the development of COPD therapies. We propose to 1.) identify novel genetic associations with COPD susceptibility and 4 COPD-related phenotypes by performing meta-analysis on patient-level data from 4 large COPD GWA studies, 2.) identify gene-by-smoking and gene-gene interactions, and 3.) develop predictive models for COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. In order to maximize the information obtained from genomic data, we will combine data from multiple studies (the National Emphysema Treatment Trial Genetics Ancillary Study, the Norway Case-Control Study, COPDGene, and ECLIPSE - total sample size=7,962) to increase power and employ regression-based and machine-learning methods to identify complex patterns of interaction in genotype data. Our study is designed to both explore and subsequently rigorously validate discovered main effect and interaction associations. Using predictive models, we will quantify the incremental predictive benefit of including genetic main effects and genetic interaction data to traditional clinical variables. Relevance: The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD. The models generated by this work will facilitate the translation of genomic discoveries to clinical practice and public health, in keeping with the NHLBI's mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed work will identify new genes associated with COPD and place them in a multivariate context so as to develop a better understanding of how genetic differences and environmental exposures contribute to the development of COPD.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting. Fertility selection as well as sex- specific viabilities will be studied in order to clarify the role of multiple paternities, which has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting.

"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma. The work proposed here will contribute both statistical methodology to modeling genomic data with graphical structures, to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and methods for high-dimensional data analysis, and offer insight into each of the clinical areas represented by the various data sets to evaluate these new methods.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7799290,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2010,1196434,-0.009601229415056419
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4. Perform a series of GWA analyses in the GHC biorepository and linked biorepositories. 4a: Alzheimer's disease (AD). 4b: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (CAAD). 4c: Complications of statin use, including elevations of CPK and muscle pain.       Through cooperation with other investigators and the NHGRI, this work will facilitate development of policies and procedures to realize the incredible potential of EMR-linked biorepositories for GWA studies to improve understanding, prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and illnesses. Specific GWA research will allow us to explore both etiologic research (AD and CAAD progression) and pharmacogenetics (statin therapy).

"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability. We are using Legionella pneumophila, a related bacterium with pathogenic strategies predicted to be conserved, to identify and characterize critical transport determinants on virulence factors. This work will lead to the identification of a new catalog of virulence factors associated with establishment of Q fever, and provide novel targets for antimicrobial development              RELEVANCE STATEMENT The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability.

"Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envirnonmental Network Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The efforts of the human genome project are beginning to provide important findings for human health. Technological advances in the laboratory, particularly in characterizing human genomic variation, have created new approaches for studying the human genome. However, current statistical and computational strategies are taking only partial advantage of this wealth of information. In the quest for disease susceptibility genes for common, complex disease, we are faced with many challenges. Selecting genetic, clinical, and environmental factors important for the trait of interest is increasingly more difficult as high throughput data generation technologies are developed. We know that genes do not act in isolation, thus numerous other factors are likely important in complex disease phenotypes. However, techniques for robust statistical modeling of important variables to predict clinical outcomes are limited in their capability for interaction effects. Ultimately, we want to know what factors are important to provide superior prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, interpretation of statistical models in a meaningful way for biomedical research has been lacking due to the inherent difficulty in making such connections. Thus, a technology that embraces the complexity of human disease and integrates multiple data sources including biological knowledge from the public domain, through a powerful analytical framework is essential for dissecting the architecture of common diseases. ATHENA: the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations is a novel framework that incorporates variable selection, modeling, and interpretation to learn more about diseases of public health interest. As the field gains experience in analyzing large scale genomic data, it is crucial that we learn from each other and develop and codify the best strategies.            Many common, complex diseases are likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Out ability to extract all of the meaningful information from very large genomic and phenotypic datasets has been limited by our analytic strategies.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. The results, together with the computer programs and ancillary databases will make a significant contribution to many ongoing and new genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related diseases.             n/a",VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,7895861,R01HL091028,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chromosomes', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exclusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophy', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sea', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Weight', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'heuristics', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'mortality', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait', 'web site']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,228000,0.011813509520011504
"Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Epistasis is the interaction between two or more genes to affect phenotype. It is now widely accepted that epistasis plays an important role in susceptibility to many common diseases. The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled genome-wide association studies (GWAS or GWA studies). It is compelling that we be able to detect epistasis using GWAS data. However, so far GWA studies have mainly focused on the association of a single gene or loci with a disease. The crucial challenge to analyzing epistasis using GWAS data is finding a way to efficiently handle high-dimensional data sets. The only possible solution is to design efficient algorithms that allow us to find the most relevant epistasic relationships without doing an exhaustive investigation. To the Principal Investigator's knowledge, no current method can do this.       This career award will investigate this problem. The specific aims are as follows: (Aim 1) develop and evaluate efficient Bayesian network-based methods for learning candidate genes associated with diseases from GWAS sets. Such genes would provide candidates for follow-up biological studies, (Aim 2) implement the methods in a pilot GWAS system for use by researchers when conducting a GWAS, (Aim 3) develop simulated genome-wide data sets and evaluate the pilot system using these data sets, and (Aim 4) conduct GWA studies concerning breast cancer and lung cancer.       Aim 1 will be addressed by developing a succinct Bayesian network model representing epistasis, efficient algorithms which are tailored to investigating such models, integration of the algorithms into methods for learning epistasis, and using simulated datasets to test the effectiveness of the methods and compare their performance to other methods. Aim 2 will be met by implementing the methods in a pilot GWAS system. Aim 3 will be satisfied by developing synthetic data sets similar to those found in GWA studies, and using them to evaluate the system. Aim 4 will be achieved by conducting GWA studies concerning breast and lung cancer. By conducting these studies, we can (1) substantiate previous results concerning the genetic basis of these diseases; (2) possibly obtain interesting new findings pertaining to these diseases.       The main hypothesis is that the proposed method will be an advance over existing methods in that it will make it computationally feasible to learn epistatic relationships from genome-wide data and it will therefore yield better discovery performance than existing methods.              Learning gene-gene interactions from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data is an important and challenging task in genetic epidemiology. This project will develop and evaluate a pilot GWAS system for performing this task. Advances obtained in analyzing GWAS data sets could enable us to learn the genetic basis of many diseases and thereby substantially improve the quality of personalized patient care.",Detecting Genome Wide Epistasis with Efficient Bayesian Network Learning,7958949,K99LM010822,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Family history of', 'GAB2 gene', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Programming', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'network models']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2010,90000,-0.006487055042030522
"Pathway-based analysis of addiction susceptibility genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to alcohol and substance dependence is known to be influenced by genetic factors. However, few specific genetic variations that alter susceptibility to addiction have been identified. This is partly because addiction is a polygenic trait, influenced by many genetic variations, each with a small marginal effect. Phenotypic characteristics are controlled by networks of interacting biochemical and physiological pathways influenced by the products of specific genes. While single genetic variants result in small changes in susceptibility to complex diseases, it is the combined effects of genes within a biochemical pathway that likely drive phenotype expression.  The research proposed in this application aims to apply novel pathway-based methods to analyze existing data from a genome wide association study of alcoholism. Case-control alcohol dependence data from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), collected by Dr. Laura Bierut and colleagues, will be analyzed. The methods that will be applied take into account known relationships between genes and their products and assess the effect of gene-sets that represent biological pathways, rather than assessing individual gene effects. Once significant pathways are identified, comprehensive analyses of genes within these pathways will be performed, to characterize the genetic effects, including interactions between genetic variations. These analyses will utilize random forest methods and LASSO logistic regression with gene-gene interaction effects.  The long term goals of this research are to improve the detection of interacting genetic risk factors for substance addiction and subtypes of substance use disorders, by applying optimal statistical techniques. While studying all possible interactions between SNPs from a genome-wide scan may not be practical, a focused approach of investigating genetic interactions within a relevant pathway is expected to be more powerful and yield interpretable results.  Analysis of existing data using new statistical methods that account for the relationships between genes that act as part of common neural or molecular pathways has great potential to identify genetic variations that contribute to individual differences in addiction susceptibility. Discovery of such genetic risk factors has important implications including increasing our understanding of the pathways of development of addiction and risk prediction. Perhaps more importantly, this knowledge is expected to help identify subtypes of addiction that require different interventions leading to personalized treatment with increased success rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified. Recently, new methods for analyzing genetic data have been proposed that take into account known relationships between genes that contribute to common biological pathways. The research proposed in this application will apply such approaches to analyze data from a genetic study of alcoholism. Results of this study are expected to help identify sets of genes that contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to substance dependence, leading to improved diagnosis and management of addiction based on an individualized treatment approach.           Project Narrative: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified.

"Computational system to predict novel genetic disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput genotyping, expression, and sequencing technologies and the development of increasingly sophisticated methods for predicting gene-disease interactions have given the new field of genomic-based personalized medicine a wealth of data: more, in fact, than can easily be processed and interpreted. Omicia is in the business of developing computational tools and diagnostics in the field of personalized medicine for cardiovascular disease (CVD). As part of that effort we are developing a software infrastructure that uses these abundant data to identify and prioritize candidate genes and their sequence variations for clinical evaluation. The research proposed in this application has three aims. In Phase II, we will enhance and optimize Omicia's Gene Inference System (GIS), prototyped during the SBIR Phase I project. In Phase II we will add additional capabilities to its candidate gene identification methods. This will build upon the Omicia Disease Genes (ODG) ontology built in Phase I, and add pathway and protein-interaction data and include ""top"" candidates from external publicaly-available clinical studies. In Aim 2, we will enhance the ability of GIS to prioritize sequence variations by improving our novel paralogous-gene variation identification algorithm (iDIP) and by integrating existing amino-acid substitution (AAS) methods. By running these algorithms over all known human genes via dbSNP, we expect to identify a list of candidate variations that will be evaluated in Aim 3 including an in vitro experiment. The goal of Aim 3 is to test the gene- and variant-predictive power of GIS and to compare it to other selection methods. The clinical study will be a single-stage case control design to test the ""top"" variant candidates from Aims 1 & 2 and compare the potential association to well-established genetic markers for the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). With approximately 700 cases and 700 matched controls, our association study will be well powered to test our predicted functional markers for MI. The GIS infrastructure is an integral part of the commercial workflow of Omicia, and will form the basis of the product pipeline. As such, it will serve as licensable commercial technology for the company by helping other biotechnology companies to develop their genetic biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic developments (theranostics). In addition, any novel variants drawn from this Phase II study will be licensable and exploitable intellectual property, useful both as the basis for future products in our internal pipeline, as well as potentially valuable additions to our patent portfolio. The Phase II goals of enhancing and clinically validating GIS serve three purposes: proving our methodology as applied to CVD and opening the door to applications in other disease areas; showcasing GIS as a key technology for managing complexity in the post-genomic era and providing clinically-relevant insights; and finally, potentially identifying valuable IP in the form of novel genetic markers for MI.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The outcome of this project will be an evaluated gene inference system (GIS) for identifying gene-disease interactions, with a focus in the area of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This system will be used as part of the Omicia product pipeline, and can also be licensed to third parties. In addition, any novel genetic markers identified as part of the validation study will themselves be valuable additions to the Omicia product and IP portfolio. Omicia's goal is to provide content and analysis tools for molecular diagnostic tests for cardiovascular conditions, with the promise of identifying patients at high risk to enable them to begin preventive care before symptoms appear. Given the prevalence of CVD in the developed world, these products are potentially a great boon to public health, as well as being significant commercial opportunities.           NARRATIVE The outcome of this project will be an evaluated gene inference system (GIS) for identifying gene-disease interactions, with a focus in the area of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,7568847,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,370919,-0.011408963331282026
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction.

"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC) proposal aims to provide a flexible analysis resource for the ENCODE project. The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project.

"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7653790,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,397297,-0.015239912708577446
"The Statistical and Computational Analysis of Flow Cytometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Flow cytometry is a data-rich technology that plays a critical role in basic research and clinical therapy for a variety of human diseases. Recent technological developments have greatly increased the areas of application and data throughput, and corresponding innovative analysis methods are needed.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7682282,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,291480,-0.0235640889639139
"Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic variants and environmental factors interacting in a composite and potentially nonlinear manner. Although the genome-wide views provided by advanced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays present an opportunity to discover previously unrecognized genomic patterns, the ability to recognize such complex features of genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association study to discover genetic determinants of health and disease from massive genomic data. The focus of this application is the development and validation of effective computational statistics approaches to detect complex interaction effects of multi-locus SNPs which could be useful for classification and prediction of disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of complex phenotypes. Based on very promising preliminary studies, the specific aims of this R21 application are carefully designed: (1) to refine and evaluate the recently developed significant conditional association (SCA) criterion and heuristic combinatorial interaction growing (HCIG) search strategy (specifically designed to discover complex interaction effects of multi-locus jointly-predictive SNPs), test and validate on real SNP based realistic simulations and compare with a panel of most relevant existing methods; and (2) to apply SCA- HCIG method to the real SNP data of NIAMS-funded FMS cohort in relationship to metabolic syndrome etc. and develop SNP marker based classification/ prediction models, assessed by the prediction power and initial biological plausibility of the implicated SNP subsets. This proposal represents a unique cross-disciplinary collaboration focusing on the development of new analytical methods to more effectively identify interacting susceptibility SNPs and environmental factors that can be used to determine individual risk to a specific disease and to estimate prognosis and response to treatment. The results could also suggest novel preventive intervetions and therapeutic targets, reduce the burden of diseases, and accelerate the realization of truly personalized medicine.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Wang, Yue (Joseph), Ph.D. Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects Project Narrative  Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic and environmental factors.

"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       We are submitting this proposal pursuant to NOT-0D-09-058, NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications.       Our group focuses on understanding how amino acid substitutions disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In our currently funded R01, we are developing methods we call in silico functional profiling. This method works by learning residue-specific protein function and then estimates when it is disrupted. This research funds our efforts to characterize what the underlying molecular disruption a protein mutation is causing and thereby improve accuracy of these approaches. In this competitive revision application, we are proposing to expand our efforts to the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation or transcript splicing. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply all of our methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three supplemental aims. First, we will evaluate genomic features for prediction of regulatory nucleotide substitutions and construct new methods to aid in their classification. Second, we will collaboratively work to develop machine learning methods for classification of nucleotide substitutions that disrupt transcript splicing. Finally, we will work to collaboratively annotate genetic data found in inherited disease, pharmacogenetics and somatic mutations in cancer.

"Multi-point and multi-locus analysis of genomic association data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a new and powerful approach to investigate the effect of inherited genetic variation on risks of complex diseases. With recent advances in genotyping technology, genome-wide association studies are now becoming a reality. Data from GWAS are expected in an accelerated rate. Despite tremendous efforts in developing efficient algorithms for mapping complex diseases/traits, single-locus based approaches are still the primary method for GWAS. However, it is known that usually multiple genetic factors, environmental factors as well as their interactions play an important role in the etiology of complex diseases. Novel and practical approaches to simultaneously model multiple variables and their interactions from hundreds of thousands single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are greatly needed. In this project, we propose to develop efficient algorithms and practical statistical tools to address two important problems in the context of genome- wide association studies: multi-point analysis and multi-locus analysis. For multi-point analysis, our Dynamic Hidden Chain Markov Model (DHCMM) can jointly model historical recombination and muta- tions, haplotype structures and frequencies, and associations, which is expected to be more effective than existing approaches. For multi-locus analysis, we propose to use an advanced machine learning approach to jointly screen SNPs that are predictive of diseases.

"Genetics of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Subtypes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune arthropathy characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues. It is a debilitating disorder in which progressive joint damage and resulting growth disorders may occur. It is the most common chronic childhood rheumatic disease in the Western world. There are at least seven subtypes that comprise JIA and these subtypes clearly differ by age of onset and gender. JIA has a strong genetic influence with sibling risk ratios of approximately 20 (S=20). However, genetic influences vary by subtypes, age of onset and gender. We propose to analyze existing genome-wide association (GWA) data on 800 JIA cases and greater than 3,000 controls of European ancestry and genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K and Affymetrix 6.0 platforms for targeted hypotheses beyond the current case:control study. We hypothesize that loci contributing to the risk of JIA can be identified through contrasting and partitioning into more homogeneous subtypes of JIA and testing for the modifying effects on these loci's risks through interactions with HLA polymorphisms, age of onset and gender. We propose to identify genetic factors of JIA via 1) the use of imputation methods to test for association with JIA and subtypes for all HapMap SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 2%; 2) computing GWA analysis for age of onset, SNP-by-gender interaction, SNP-by-HLA interaction and SNP-by-SNP interactions; 3) identifying regions of loss of heterozygosity and copy number variation predictive of JIA and its subtypes; and 4) computing GWA for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in individuals with both Affymetrix 6.0 and existing global gene expression data. The proposal includes well powered GWA analyses for JIA, novel methods such as statistical machine learning for interaction analyses, and integration of expression and genotype data. The proposed series of analyses will assist in our long- term goal of understanding JIA, while recognizing the diversity of conditions known as JIA and making the discoveries of greater relevance for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues.

"A National Consortium to Explore the Genotypic Basis for ESRD in Lupus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End stage renal disease (ESRD), one of the most serious and costly complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), occurs in a sub-set of patients with SLE-related renal involvement. Factors predisposing to ESRD presumably include both genetics and environmental factors, and there is unequivocal evidence that ESRD disproportionately affects lupus persons of African American descent. Data in SLE-related ESRD suggest that at least two genetic factors, -- certain allelic variants of the genes FCGR3A and MYH9, -- contribute to ESRD risk. However, two genes alone do not define the scope of genetic risk for ESRD. Therefore, building on our precedent data for genetic contributions, it is timely to undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the genetic risk factors for ESRD in European American (EA) and African Americans (AA) with lupus nephritis (LN/ESRD). Until now, two major barriers have precluded such a study. Technical limitations in genotyping platform and coverage have been overcome with the Illumina Human Omni- 1 Quad BeadChip. To surmount the second barrier of limited study populations, we have assembled an unprecedented team of rheumatologists, nephrologists and statistical geneticists with IRB protocols active, the clinical studies infrastructure in place and the patient collections and clinical data more than 75% in hand. Thus (1) Our first aim is to characterize the genetic susceptibility factors associated with ESRD by performing a  GWAS with 800 EA LN/ESRD and 800 AA LN/ESRD compared to lupus subjects of each ethnicity but  without nephritis and normal control subjects.  (2) We propose that [gene x gene] and [gene x environment] interactions are biologically important and may be more easily detectable using the machine learning and more modern likelihood-based approaches. Therefore, our second aim is to apply novel approaches to gene discovery and biological pathway characterization including Bayesian networks, alternative decision trees, HyperLasso, and penalized logistic regression.  (3) Finally, our third aim is to build an essential resource, consistent with NIH specimen and data sharing guidelines and supported by the institution. This resource will enable follow-up studies in fine-mapping, deep-sequencing, SNP identification, pathway analysis and methods development. Our consortium leverages current resources and investments by NIAMS, NIDDK, NIEHS, NCRR, CDCP and private foundations to create a unique opportunity to address a major health care challenge. We have a substantial head start, drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, and are poised to identify genetic risk factors, leading to strategies for ESRD reduction, which would enable substantial cost savings and reduction in morbidity and mortality as it reduces ethnic disparities in health outcomes.           7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, this study is uniquely positioned to capitalize on a multidisciplinary team to leverage existing resources to address important questions about the underlying genetic influences on susceptibility to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in lupus. This understanding may lead to strategies for ESRD intervention, may reduce ethnic disparities in health outcome, and may enable substantial cost savings in the health care industry.

We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for HNPCC, which may also have important implications for sporadic colorectal cancer as well as other cancer sites.             n/a",Molecular Genetics of HNPCC,7637943,R01CA070759,"['Abbreviations', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Budgets', 'CHEK2 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoint', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Cyclin D1', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Individual', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Learning', 'Leukocytes', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'MDM2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mutate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleotide Excision Repair', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preventive', 'Proteolysis', 'Public Health', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'STK6 gene', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Ubiquitination', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora-A kinase', 'base', 'cancer site', 'cdc Genes', 'early onset', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'homologous recombination', 'mutation carrier', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'protein protein interaction', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2009,567963,-0.0006147743841109954
"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting. Fertility selection as well as sex- specific viabilities will be studied in order to clarify the role of multiple paternities, which has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting. Genomic data from mammalian species will be analyzed using tools from statistical learning in order to predict which genes are likely to be imprinted. Correlations between DMA sequence properties and predicted imprinting status based on life history characteristics will also be sought.           n/a",Population Genetics Theory,7631265,R01GM028016,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriophages', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Formulations', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Fertility', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Genomics', 'Haploidy', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population Genetics', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'driving force', 'father role', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'imprint', 'influenza epidemic', 'life history', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,259841,0.005003094691455783
"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma. The work proposed here will contribute both statistical methodology to modeling genomic data with graphical structures, to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and methods for high-dimensional data analysis, and offer insight into each of the clinical areas represented by the various data sets to evaluate these new methods.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7591153,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2009,1090595,-0.009601229415056419

"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7633295,R01DA018341,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Coiled Bodies', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'System', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'egg', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'neurotransmission', 'rapid technique', 'tool']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2009,293485,0.01030824044873514

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.           Project Narrative We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome.

"Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an integrated desktop application to combine data from expression array, RNA transcript array, proteomics, SNP array (for polymorphism an analysis, as well as LOH and copy number determination), methylation array, histone modification array, promoter array, and microRNA array and metabolomics technologies. Current approaches to analysis of individual `omic' technologies suffer from problems of fragmentation, that present an incomplete view of the workings of the cell. However, effective integration into a single analytic platform is non-trivial. There is a need for a consistent approach, infrastructure, and interface between array types, to maximize ease of use, while recognizing and accommodating the specific computational and statistical requirements, and biological context, of each array. A central challenge is the need to create and work with lists of genomic regions of interest (GROIs) for each sample: we propose three novel approaches to aid in identification of GROIs. These lists must then be integrated with rectangular (sample by feature) data arrays to facilitate statistical analysis. Integration between array types occurs at the computational level, through a unified software package, statistically, through tools that seek statistical relationships between features from different arrays, biologically, through use of annotations (particularly gene ontology, protein- protein and protein-DNA interactions, and pathway membership) that document functional relationships between features, and through genomic interactions that suggest relationships between features that map to the same regions of the genome. The end product will support analysis of each platform separately, with a comprehensive suite of data management, statistical and heuristic analytic tools and the means to place findings of interest into a meaningful biological context through cross-reference to extensive biobases. Beyond that, a range of methods - statistical, biological and genomic - will be available to explore interactions and associations between platforms.

The utility of the next generation of arrays - which focus on critical regulation and control functions of the cell - will be stymied by an initial lack of suitable bioinformatic tools.

"Analysis Tool for Heritable and Envirnonmental Network Associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The efforts of the human genome project are beginning to provide important findings for human health. Technological advances in the laboratory, particularly in characterizing human genomic variation, have created new approaches for studying the human genome. However, current statistical and computational strategies are taking only partial advantage of this wealth of information. In the quest for disease susceptibility genes for common, complex disease, we are faced with many challenges. Selecting genetic, clinical, and environmental factors important for the trait of interest is increasingly more difficult as high throughput data generation technologies are developed. We know that genes do not act in isolation, thus numerous other factors are likely important in complex disease phenotypes. However, techniques for robust statistical modeling of important variables to predict clinical outcomes are limited in their capability for interaction effects. Ultimately, we want to know what factors are important to provide superior prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, interpretation of statistical models in a meaningful way for biomedical research has been lacking due to the inherent difficulty in making such connections. Thus, a technology that embraces the complexity of human disease and integrates multiple data sources including biological knowledge from the public domain, through a powerful analytical framework is essential for dissecting the architecture of common diseases. ATHENA: the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations is a novel framework that incorporates variable selection, modeling, and interpretation to learn more about diseases of public health interest. As the field gains experience in analyzing large scale genomic data, it is crucial that we learn from each other and develop and codify the best strategies.            Many common, complex diseases are likely due to a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Out ability to extract all of the meaningful information from very large genomic and phenotypic datasets has been limited by our analytic strategies.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             n/a",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7650125,R01ES015165,"['Acids', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genistein', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Weight Gain', 'Xenobiotics', 'bisphenol A', 'bisulfite', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'environmental agent', 'fetal', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human birth weight', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'improved', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'offspring']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,578836,-0.005828966526732467
"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline.

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website.

"Pathway-based analysis of addiction susceptibility genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to alcohol and substance dependence is known to be influenced by genetic factors. However, few specific genetic variations that alter susceptibility to addiction have been identified. This is partly because addiction is a polygenic trait, influenced by many genetic variations, each with a small marginal effect. Phenotypic characteristics are controlled by networks of interacting biochemical and physiological pathways influenced by the products of specific genes. While single genetic variants result in small changes in susceptibility to complex diseases, it is the combined effects of genes within a biochemical pathway that likely drive phenotype expression.  The research proposed in this application aims to apply novel pathway-based methods to analyze existing data from a genome wide association study of alcoholism. Case-control alcohol dependence data from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), collected by Dr. Laura Bierut and colleagues, will be analyzed. The methods that will be applied take into account known relationships between genes and their products and assess the effect of gene-sets that represent biological pathways, rather than assessing individual gene effects. Once significant pathways are identified, comprehensive analyses of genes within these pathways will be performed, to characterize the genetic effects, including interactions between genetic variations. These analyses will utilize random forest methods and LASSO logistic regression with gene-gene interaction effects.  The long term goals of this research are to improve the detection of interacting genetic risk factors for substance addiction and subtypes of substance use disorders, by applying optimal statistical techniques. While studying all possible interactions between SNPs from a genome-wide scan may not be practical, a focused approach of investigating genetic interactions within a relevant pathway is expected to be more powerful and yield interpretable results.  Analysis of existing data using new statistical methods that account for the relationships between genes that act as part of common neural or molecular pathways has great potential to identify genetic variations that contribute to individual differences in addiction susceptibility. Discovery of such genetic risk factors has important implications including increasing our understanding of the pathways of development of addiction and risk prediction. Perhaps more importantly, this knowledge is expected to help identify subtypes of addiction that require different interventions leading to personalized treatment with increased success rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified. Recently, new methods for analyzing genetic data have been proposed that take into account known relationships between genes that contribute to common biological pathways. The research proposed in this application will apply such approaches to analyze data from a genetic study of alcoholism. Results of this study are expected to help identify sets of genes that contribute to individual differences in susceptibility to substance dependence, leading to improved diagnosis and management of addiction based on an individualized treatment approach.           Project Narrative: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified.

"Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use, primarily cigarette smoking, is the greatest source of preventable mortality in the world and costs over $160 million in health-related economic losses in the U.S. alone. Nicotine dependence is the primary reason that smokers continue smoking and that most unassisted quit attempts fail within a single week. It is known that nicotine dependence has a genetic component, but that it is a complex trait, i.e., no single gene is responsible for nicotine dependence. Thus, researchers and funding agencies have devoted considerable effort and support to identifying the genetic underpinnings of the trait through whole genome scans, putting us in a unique position to identify global genetic predictors of nicotine dependence. This study proposes to realize the promise of the NIDA-funded Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND) whole genome data through the accomplishment of two specific aims: (1) to identify the set of genetic variations underlying the complex trait of nicotine dependence using a cutting-edge computational method called Bayesian networks and (2) to validate the prognostic model in an entirely independent population. This proposal represents the very first step of a broader research program aimed at discovering the complex network of interactions underpinning nicotine dependence. The ultimate result of this program will provide a clinical tool, which will accurately assess the risk of dependency, allow for individualized preventive measures, elucidate the molecular processes of dependence and nominate novel targets for the pharmaceutical treatment of nicotine addiction. Nicotine dependence places an enormous burden on individuals and society. Genetic factors are responsible for at least some part of the condition, and the NIDA has already funded a study, called COGEND, that examined over 40,000 genetic variations in people who were nicotine dependent and who were not nicotine dependent. We propose to use cutting-edge techniques to analyze this large dataset to identify a valid predictive model of nicotine dependence that will help us predict, diagnose, and treat this condition.        n/a",Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance,7617627,R21DA025168,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dental Schools', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco use', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'smoking cessation', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2009,175000,-0.010056039405239922
"Computational system to predict novel genetic disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput genotyping, expression, and sequencing technologies and the development of increasingly sophisticated methods for predicting gene-disease interactions have given the new field of genomic-based personalized medicine a wealth of data: more, in fact, than can easily be processed and interpreted. Omicia is in the business of developing computational tools and diagnostics in the field of personalized medicine for cardiovascular disease (CVD). As part of that effort we are developing a software infrastructure that uses these abundant data to identify and prioritize candidate genes and their sequence variations for clinical evaluation. The research proposed in this application has three aims. In Phase II, we will enhance and optimize Omicia's Gene Inference System (GIS), prototyped during the SBIR Phase I project. In Phase II we will add additional capabilities to its candidate gene identification methods. This will build upon the Omicia Disease Genes (ODG) ontology built in Phase I, and add pathway and protein-interaction data and include ""top"" candidates from external publicaly-available clinical studies. In Aim 2, we will enhance the ability of GIS to prioritize sequence variations by improving our novel paralogous-gene variation identification algorithm (iDIP) and by integrating existing amino-acid substitution (AAS) methods. By running these algorithms over all known human genes via dbSNP, we expect to identify a list of candidate variations that will be evaluated in Aim 3 including an in vitro experiment. The goal of Aim 3 is to test the gene- and variant-predictive power of GIS and to compare it to other selection methods. The clinical study will be a single-stage case control design to test the ""top"" variant candidates from Aims 1 & 2 and compare the potential association to well-established genetic markers for the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). With approximately 700 cases and 700 matched controls, our association study will be well powered to test our predicted functional markers for MI. The GIS infrastructure is an integral part of the commercial workflow of Omicia, and will form the basis of the product pipeline. As such, it will serve as licensable commercial technology for the company by helping other biotechnology companies to develop their genetic biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic developments (theranostics). In addition, any novel variants drawn from this Phase II study will be licensable and exploitable intellectual property, useful both as the basis for future products in our internal pipeline, as well as potentially valuable additions to our patent portfolio. The Phase II goals of enhancing and clinically validating GIS serve three purposes: proving our methodology as applied to CVD and opening the door to applications in other disease areas; showcasing GIS as a key technology for managing complexity in the post-genomic era and providing clinically-relevant insights; and finally, potentially identifying valuable IP in the form of novel genetic markers for MI.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The outcome of this project will be an evaluated gene inference system (GIS) for identifying gene-disease interactions, with a focus in the area of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This system will be used as part of the Omicia product pipeline, and can also be licensed to third parties. In addition, any novel genetic markers identified as part of the validation study will themselves be valuable additions to the Omicia product and IP portfolio. Omicia's goal is to provide content and analysis tools for molecular diagnostic tests for cardiovascular conditions, with the promise of identifying patients at high risk to enable them to begin preventive care before symptoms appear. Given the prevalence of CVD in the developed world, these products are potentially a great boon to public health, as well as being significant commercial opportunities.           NARRATIVE The outcome of this project will be an evaluated gene inference system (GIS) for identifying gene-disease interactions, with a focus in the area of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

"Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies are anticipated to yield important new information as to the presence of specific genetic determinants found in Streptococcus mutans, a microbe strongly associated with a severe dental caries in affecting young children called severe early childhood caries or S-ECC. The long-term benefit of such information should lead researchers toward devising both diagnostic and preventive strategies against dental though better understanding its microbial causation. Using a powerful technique of suppressive subtraction DNA hybridization, the first specific aim is to test the hypothesis that strains of S. mutans found in S-ECC children differ in genetic composition compared to strains found in caries-free (CF) children. Unique genetic loci that are specific to S-ECC strains will be identified and characterized. Some of these genetic loci will prove informative as biomarkers for health or disease. Using the power of multiple test analyses derived artificial intelligence programming; biomarkers will be used as the basis for a modeling algorithm capable of classifying strains of S. mutans in one of two categories (S-ECC or CF). The second aim of this study is to survey strains of S. mutans associated with either S-ECC or CF status for known or suspected genetic elements thought to influence the pathogenesis or virulence of S. mutans. The third aim is to survey a larger, racial/ethnical diverse population of S-ECC or CF children for the presence or absence of the biomarkers identified in the first two aims. It is anticipated that this research will yield genetic markers for disease capable of providing clinicians with a diagnostic test that can assess risk for developing S-ECC. 7.           n/a",Microbial Diversity and Genetic Characterization of Cariogenic Biofilms,7372919,R01DE013937,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Causations', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Dental', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Dot Immunoblotting', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Islands', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Numbers', 'Pathogenesis', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Score', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors', 'base', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'genetic element', 'microbial', 'programs', 'research study', 'tool']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,366775,-0.011408963331282026
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). The methods developed here will be applied to nearly 1500 haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) across approximately 300 cancer susceptibility genes measured in 542 subjects with bladder cancer and 745 healthy controls ascertained as part of a large epidemiological study from the state of New Hampshire.          n/a",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,7485154,R01LM009012,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boxing', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'New Hampshire', 'Numbers', 'Predisposition', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'analytical method', 'cancer type', 'combinatorial', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2008,304625,0.010882142954696822
"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC) proposal aims to provide a flexible analysis resource for the ENCODE project. The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project. We will also provide quality assurance and summary metrics of genome-wide multiple alignments. This area has a number of complex statistical, algorithmic and engineering issues, which we will solve using state of the art techniques.

"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.)

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7488003,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease regression', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,291480,-0.0235640889639139
"The Statistical and Computational Analysis of Flow Cytometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Flow cytometry is a data-rich technology that plays a critical role in basic research and clinical therapy for a variety of human diseases. Recent technological developments have greatly increased the areas of application and data throughput, and corresponding innovative analysis methods are needed. In order to be able to take advantage of these new capabilities researchers need access to high quality analysis tools that will help to identify subpopulations of cells with particular characteristics. The methods we are proposing include advanced methods for machine learning and visualization. We will apply our methods to a number of different scenarios such as the analysis of longitudinal data, and the analysis of data arising from clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of this project are to provide statistical and computational methods for the analysis of flow cytometry data.

"Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposed study will build upon the extensive epidemiologic database and specimen repository derived from an ongoing bladder cancer study entitled ""Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer: A Molecular Epidemiologic Approach"" (RO1 CA74880, PI: Xifeng Wu). The parent grant involved a multidisciplinary group of researchers applying a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to bladder carcinogenesis, with a focus on genes involved in protecting against genomic instability, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, and telomere maintenance. It is increasing recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). We have recently shown that an IL-6 promoter SNP (G-174C) is associated with BC risk and progression. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that BC is modulated by common, low penetrance polymorphisms in inflammation related genes, interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. We will take a pathway based genotyping approach and apply novel statistical tools to address the hypothesis. There are 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify candidate polymorphisms in inflammation related genes that predispose individuals to BC. We plan to perform genotyping of a comprehensive list of potential functional polymorphisms in inflammation genes (85 polymorphisms in 44 genes) on 1000 Caucasian cases and 1000 controls matched on age, gender, and ethnicity. Specific Aim 2: To perform genotyping on tagging SNPs for the top 8 candidate genes that were identified in Specific Aim 1 (using a significance level of 0.1) identified in Specific Aim 1. This will give us a complete picture of the role that the specific gene plays in BC etiology. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional variants that might have been missed using individual SNP-based approaches. Specific Aim 3: To apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene- gene interactions influencing risk for BC. These analyses will examine SNP main effects and gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interaction and develop and validate algorithms, which will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. The application will allow us to have a comprehensive picture of the effects of functional polymorphisms in inflammation related genes on BC risk.          n/a",Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk,7458073,R03CA130063,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Significance Level', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'college', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'promoter', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R03,2008,77000,-0.008253676197244753
"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma. The work proposed here will contribute both statistical methodology to modeling genomic data with graphical structures, to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and methods for high-dimensional data analysis, and offer insight into each of the clinical areas represented by the various data sets to evaluate these new methods.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting. Fertility selection as well as sex- specific viabilities will be studied in order to clarify the role of multiple paternities, which has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting. Genomic data from mammalian species will be analyzed using tools from statistical learning in order to predict which genes are likely to be imprinted. Correlations between DMA sequence properties and predicted imprinting status based on life history characteristics will also be sought.           n/a",Population Genetics Theory,7457930,R01GM028016,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriophages', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Formulations', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fertility', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Genomics', 'Haploidy', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Organism', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Population Genetics', 'Production', 'Property', 'Purpose', 'Rate', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistically Significant', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'driving force', 'father role', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'imprint', 'influenza epidemic', 'life history', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,254996,0.005003094691455783
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.          n/a",Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer,7387530,U01CA127615,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Maps', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'New England', 'New Hampshire', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Occupational Exposure', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproduction spores', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Technology', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'aggregation pathway', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'case control', 'college', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U01,2008,1077416,-0.009601229415056419
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4.

"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7440354,R01DA018341,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Coiled Bodies', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'System', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'egg', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'neurotransmission', 'rapid technique', 'tool']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2008,282792,0.01030824044873514
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3.

"Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an integrated desktop application to combine data from expression array, RNA transcript array, proteomics, SNP array (for polymorphism an analysis, as well as LOH and copy number determination), methylation array, histone modification array, promoter array, and microRNA array and metabolomics technologies. Current approaches to analysis of individual `omic' technologies suffer from problems of fragmentation, that present an incomplete view of the workings of the cell. However, effective integration into a single analytic platform is non-trivial. There is a need for a consistent approach, infrastructure, and interface between array types, to maximize ease of use, while recognizing and accommodating the specific computational and statistical requirements, and biological context, of each array. A central challenge is the need to create and work with lists of genomic regions of interest (GROIs) for each sample: we propose three novel approaches to aid in identification of GROIs. These lists must then be integrated with rectangular (sample by feature) data arrays to facilitate statistical analysis. Integration between array types occurs at the computational level, through a unified software package, statistically, through tools that seek statistical relationships between features from different arrays, biologically, through use of annotations (particularly gene ontology, protein- protein and protein-DNA interactions, and pathway membership) that document functional relationships between features, and through genomic interactions that suggest relationships between features that map to the same regions of the genome. The end product will support analysis of each platform separately, with a comprehensive suite of data management, statistical and heuristic analytic tools and the means to place findings of interest into a meaningful biological context through cross-reference to extensive biobases. Beyond that, a range of methods - statistical, biological and genomic - will be available to explore interactions and associations between platforms.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the large-scale array technologies have provided an unprecedented capability to model cellular processes, both in normal functioning and disease states, this capability is utterly dependent on the availability of complex data management, computational, statistical and informatic software tools.  The utility of the next generation of arrays - which focus on critical regulation and control functions of the cell - will be stymied by an initial lack of suitable bioinformatic tools.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases.

"Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the genomes of more and more species are sequenced it has become apparent that 1 of the most powerful techniques for detemining region function in the human genome is by comparison to the genomes of other species. The implications of such understanding for disease diagnosis and specialized drug and vaccine design are dear. Similarly, genomic comparison between bacteria can reveal regions which are functionally important in the development of infectious diseases and again aid drug and vaccine design. This project has 2 primary research goals. One (1) is the development of methodology for finding functionally predictive signatures of non-coding sequences (NCS) highly conserved across multiple species, and the other is to develop novel approaches for defecting Horizontal Gene Transfer (HG'T). The comparison of genomes is the common thread in this research. ln pursuit of their first goal, the investigators plan to integrate genomic sequence data, provided by their collaborators, with experimental and literature data, such as microarray-expression data, GO-functional-annotation for nearby genes, and ChlP-Chip data. The results will be used to evaluate the functional relevance, if any, of each NCS and then to define a signature predictive of function in terms of measurable covariates and sequence structure. For instance, if a sequence signature characterizes NCS whose nearest genes contribute to a particular function then an unknown gene close to an NCS with the same signature would be a prime candidate for interrogation of that function. The Investigators propose to attack this problem  by 1). Developing non standard types of clustering methods based on supervised learning algorithms, e.g., Random Forests, 2) Representing the NCS by the parameters of a stochastic model and determining appropriate thresholds for model fitting by using resampling and other Monte Carlo methods. Under the second topic, the investigators propose 2 different approaches for determining whether functionaIly significant FGT has occurred in bacteria. The first approach is to take a known functionally important famlly (NIFgenes) for which HGT is a matter of dispute, and devise quantitative measures which they expect will enable a firm conclusion. They intend to refine similarity measures between genes in different species ,such as BLAST scores, corrected for evolutionary distance. They will compute these measures for pairs of NIF genes in different species, pairs, pairs of genes known to be HGT (antibiotic immunity conferring genes) and genes very unlikely to be HGT (ribosomal proteins). The second approach is to look for anomalously long stretches of 16s RNA conserved within substantial subsets of bacterial species which are otherwise only distantly related.  Mathematical and statistical challenge include: Under approach I, standardizing comparisons of genes with different mutation rates; devising an appropriate classifier for HGT vs. non HGT, and computing appropriate estimates of the probability of classifying a gene as HGT when it isn't and vice versa; Under approach II, extending existing methods for detecting large inclusions by taking into account phylogenetic tree topology and branch lengths.            n/a",Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT,7418308,R01GM075312,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Boxing', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Disputes', 'Distant', 'Drops', 'Exhibits', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nif Genes', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Planning Techniques', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Tetraodontidae', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'heuristics', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'size', 'statistics', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'willingness']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,162196,-0.019922483493211806
"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             n/a",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7478414,R01ES015165,"['Acids', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genistein', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Supplementation', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Xenobiotics', 'bisphenol A', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'environmental agent', 'fetal', 'human birth weight', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'improved', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'toxicant', 'uptake']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,577197,-0.005828966526732467
"Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use, primarily cigarette smoking, is the greatest source of preventable mortality in the world and costs over $160 million in health-related economic losses in the U.S. alone. Nicotine dependence is the primary reason that smokers continue smoking and that most unassisted quit attempts fail within a single week. It is known that nicotine dependence has a genetic component, but that it is a complex trait, i.e., no single gene is responsible for nicotine dependence. Thus, researchers and funding agencies have devoted considerable effort and support to identifying the genetic underpinnings of the trait through whole genome scans, putting us in a unique position to identify global genetic predictors of nicotine dependence. This study proposes to realize the promise of the NIDA-funded Collaborative Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND) whole genome data through the accomplishment of two specific aims: (1) to identify the set of genetic variations underlying the complex trait of nicotine dependence using a cutting-edge computational method called Bayesian networks and (2) to validate the prognostic model in an entirely independent population. This proposal represents the very first step of a broader research program aimed at discovering the complex network of interactions underpinning nicotine dependence. The ultimate result of this program will provide a clinical tool, which will accurately assess the risk of dependency, allow for individualized preventive measures, elucidate the molecular processes of dependence and nominate novel targets for the pharmaceutical treatment of nicotine addiction. Nicotine dependence places an enormous burden on individuals and society. Genetic factors are responsible for at least some part of the condition, and the NIDA has already funded a study, called COGEND, that examined over 40,000 genetic variations in people who were nicotine dependent and who were not nicotine dependent. We propose to use cutting-edge techniques to analyze this large dataset to identify a valid predictive model of nicotine dependence that will help us predict, diagnose, and treat this condition.        n/a",Beyond Association: Predictive Modeling of Nicotine Dependance,7509667,R21DA025168,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dental Schools', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco use', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Week', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'smoking cessation', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2008,175000,-0.010056039405239922
"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7387471,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2008,220227,-0.019886530436829485
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). The methods developed here will be applied to nearly 1500 haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) across approximately 300 cancer susceptibility genes measured in 542 subjects with bladder cancer and 745 healthy controls ascertained as part of a large epidemiological study from the state of New Hampshire.          n/a",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,7279853,R01LM009012,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boxing', 'Cancer-Predisposing Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'New Hampshire', 'Numbers', 'Predisposition', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'analytical method', 'cancer type', 'combinatorial', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2007,310526,0.010882142954696822
"Statistical Methods for Genomic and Proteomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose developing, evaluating and comparing statistical methods in analyzing and interpreting microarray data, including a heart failure dataset collected in the co-Principal Investigator's lab. Some of the proposed methods will incorporate or be applied to other types of genomic or proteomic data. In Aim A.1, we consider detecting differential gene expression. A weighted permutation scheme is proposed to improve permutation-based inference procedures, and these methods will be compared with several recently proposed parametric and semi-parametric methods. We also propose incorporating existing biological data in the statistical methods. In Aim A.2, we study a clustering-based classification (CBC) method for gene function prediction using microarray data. CBC will be compared with other state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests. Other sources of biological data, such as protein-protein interaction data, will be incorporated in the proposed method. In Aim A.3, we consider sample classification and prediction based on gene expression profiles in a general framework called penalized partial least squares (PPLS). PPLS will be compared with other supervised machine learning algorithms. We will extend PPLS to combine microarray data from multiple studies.

"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7322388,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,364130,-0.015239912708577446
"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7292731,R01HG003618,"['Address', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease regression', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Finland', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Human Gene Mapping', 'Human Genome Project', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'disorder prevention', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'programs', 'simulation', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,297126,-0.0235640889639139
"Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposed study will build upon the extensive epidemiologic database and specimen repository derived from an ongoing bladder cancer study entitled ""Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer: A Molecular Epidemiologic Approach"" (RO1 CA74880, PI: Xifeng Wu). The parent grant involved a multidisciplinary group of researchers applying a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to bladder carcinogenesis, with a focus on genes involved in protecting against genomic instability, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, and telomere maintenance. It is increasing recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). We have recently shown that an IL-6 promoter SNP (G-174C) is associated with BC risk and progression. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that BC is modulated by common, low penetrance polymorphisms in inflammation related genes, interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. We will take a pathway based genotyping approach and apply novel statistical tools to address the hypothesis. There are 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify candidate polymorphisms in inflammation related genes that predispose individuals to BC. We plan to perform genotyping of a comprehensive list of potential functional polymorphisms in inflammation genes (85 polymorphisms in 44 genes) on 1000 Caucasian cases and 1000 controls matched on age, gender, and ethnicity. Specific Aim 2: To perform genotyping on tagging SNPs for the top 8 candidate genes that were identified in Specific Aim 1 (using a significance level of 0.1) identified in Specific Aim 1. This will give us a complete picture of the role that the specific gene plays in BC etiology. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional variants that might have been missed using individual SNP-based approaches. Specific Aim 3: To apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene- gene interactions influencing risk for BC. These analyses will examine SNP main effects and gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interaction and develop and validate algorithms, which will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. The application will allow us to have a comprehensive picture of the effects of functional polymorphisms in inflammation related genes on BC risk.          n/a",Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk,7320980,R03CA130063,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Significance Level', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'college', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'promoter', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UT MD ANDERSON CANCER CTR,R03,2007,77000,-0.008253676197244753
"Methods for genomic data with graphical structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this project concerns the development of novel statistical methods and computational tools for statistical and probabilistic modeling of genomic data motivated by important biological questions and experiments. The specific aim of the current project is to develop new statistical models and methods for analysis of genomic data with graphical structures, focusing on methods for analyzing genetic pathways and networks, including the development of nonparametric pathway-smooth tests for two-sample and analysis of variance problems for identifying pathways with perturbed activity between two or multiple experimental conditions, the development of group Lasso and group threshold gradient descent regularized estimation procedures for the pathway-smoothed generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazards models and the accelerated failure time models in order to identify pathways that are related to various clinical phenotypes. These methods hinge on novel integration of spectral graph theory, non-parametric methods for analysis of multivariate data and regularized estimation methods fro statistical learning. The new methods can be applied to different types of genomic data and will ideally facilitate the identification of genes and biological pathways underlying various complex human diseases and complex biological processes. The project will also investigate the robustness, power and efficiencies o these methods and compare them with existing methods. In addition, this project will develop practical a feasible computer programs in order to implement the proposed methods, to evaluate the performance o these methods through application to real data on microarray gene expression studies of human hear failure, cardiac allograft rejection and neuroblastoma. The work proposed here will contribute both statistical methodology to modeling genomic data with graphical structures, to studying complex phenotypes and biological systems and methods for high-dimensional data analysis, and offer insight into each of the clinical areas represented by the various data sets to evaluate these new methods.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting. Fertility selection as well as sex- specific viabilities will be studied in order to clarify the role of multiple paternities, which has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting. Genomic data from mammalian species will be analyzed using tools from statistical learning in order to predict which genes are likely to be imprinted. Correlations between DMA sequence properties and predicted imprinting status based on life history characteristics will also be sought.           n/a",Population Genetics Theory,7313297,R01GM028016,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriophages', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Formulations', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fertility', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Genomics', 'Haploidy', 'Human', 'Influenza', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Organism', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Population Genetics', 'Production', 'Property', 'Purpose', 'Rate', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistically Significant', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'driving force', 'father role', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'imprint', 'influenza epidemic', 'life history', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,258957,0.005003094691455783
"Development and Use of Network Infrastructure for High-Throughput GWA Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Linking biorepositories of patients in healthcare delivery systems with electronic medical records (EMRs) is an efficient strategy for high-throughput genome wide association (GWA) studies, as phenotype, covariable and exposure data of public health importance can be economically abstracted and pooled across delivery systems to facilitate the large numbers of subjects needed for GWA studies of each phenotype. Key obstacles to the success of this strategy remain. In this project, which will use population-based genomic and phenotype data from a well characterized population served by a delivery system which captures virtually all health care encounters in its data bases. Researchers from Group Health Cooperative's Center for Health Studies, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will address these obstacles by pursuing the following specific aims:       1. Informed by results from targeted focus groups, implement a consensus process with key stakeholders to develop recommendations concerning consent, data sharing, and return of research results to subjects.    2. Work together with other network sites to develop a virtual data warehouse (VDW) analogous to that used in the Cancer Research Network, and extend natural language processing (NLP) to pathology, radiology, and clinical chart notes.   3. Develop and test strategies to determine whether each candidate EMR-based phenotype is sufficiently valid to pursue analyses of GWA data, and develop statistical methods that explicitly account for heterogeneous phenotype validity within and between sites.    4.

"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7270627,R01DA018341,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Coiled Bodies', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'System', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'egg', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'neurotransmission', 'rapid technique', 'tool']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2007,279238,0.01030824044873514
"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             n/a",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7290450,R01ES015165,"['Acids', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genistein', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Supplementation', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Xenobiotics', 'bisphenol A', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'environmental agent', 'fetal', 'human birth weight', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'improved', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'toxicant', 'uptake']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,568393,-0.005828966526732467
"Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the genomes of more and more species are sequenced it has become apparent that 1 of the most powerful techniques for detemining region function in the human genome is by comparison to the genomes of other species. The implications of such understanding for disease diagnosis and specialized drug and vaccine design are dear. Similarly, genomic comparison between bacteria can reveal regions which are functionally important in the development of infectious diseases and again aid drug and vaccine design. This project has 2 primary research goals. One (1) is the development of methodology for finding functionally predictive signatures of non-coding sequences (NCS) highly conserved across multiple species, and the other is to develop novel approaches for defecting Horizontal Gene Transfer (HG'T). The comparison of genomes is the common thread in this research. ln pursuit of their first goal, the investigators plan to integrate genomic sequence data, provided by their collaborators, with experimental and literature data, such as microarray-expression data, GO-functional-annotation for nearby genes, and ChlP-Chip data. The results will be used to evaluate the functional relevance, if any, of each NCS and then to define a signature predictive of function in terms of measurable covariates and sequence structure. For instance, if a sequence signature characterizes NCS whose nearest genes contribute to a particular function then an unknown gene close to an NCS with the same signature would be a prime candidate for interrogation of that function. The Investigators propose to attack this problem  by 1). Developing non standard types of clustering methods based on supervised learning algorithms, e.g., Random Forests, 2) Representing the NCS by the parameters of a stochastic model and determining appropriate thresholds for model fitting by using resampling and other Monte Carlo methods. Under the second topic, the investigators propose 2 different approaches for determining whether functionaIly significant FGT has occurred in bacteria. The first approach is to take a known functionally important famlly (NIFgenes) for which HGT is a matter of dispute, and devise quantitative measures which they expect will enable a firm conclusion. They intend to refine similarity measures between genes in different species ,such as BLAST scores, corrected for evolutionary distance. They will compute these measures for pairs of NIF genes in different species, pairs, pairs of genes known to be HGT (antibiotic immunity conferring genes) and genes very unlikely to be HGT (ribosomal proteins). The second approach is to look for anomalously long stretches of 16s RNA conserved within substantial subsets of bacterial species which are otherwise only distantly related.  Mathematical and statistical challenge include: Under approach I, standardizing comparisons of genes with different mutation rates; devising an appropriate classifier for HGT vs. non HGT, and computing appropriate estimates of the probability of classifying a gene as HGT when it isn't and vice versa; Under approach II, extending existing methods for detecting large inclusions by taking into account phylogenetic tree topology and branch lengths.            n/a",Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT,7240439,R01GM075312,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Boxing', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Disputes', 'Distant', 'Drops', 'Exhibits', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nif Genes', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Planning Techniques', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Tetraodontidae', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'heuristics', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'size', 'statistics', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'willingness']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,163829,-0.019922483493211806

"Genetical Genomics Analysis Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Response to drug treatment is thought dependent upon genotype for many modern therapies. Knowledge of how each genotype responds to a particular therapy is bene?cial only in that one can identify portions of the population which cannot reap the benefits of said treatment. A better course of action is to identify not only which genotype responds, or not, to a particular therapy, but to identify which region of the genome is responding, or not, and how. We believe that this information will lead to new drug targets and better therapies that benefit a larger portion of the population. The goal of this proposal is to provide a suite of software tools for genetic and genomic scientists performing gene mapping experiments with genomic data as the response variable. These tools will ideally provide functionality for 1) detecting polymorphic regions of the genome that con- fer transcript expression differences, 2) identify polymorphic regions of the genome that impart expression differences in genes located elsewhere in the genome, and 3) detecting interactions between loci that may correspond to epistatic effects on transcription. Some software already exists to perform each of these tasks as distinct independent solutions. This proposal intends to produce an integrated solution, S+EQTL (S-PLUS for expression quantitative trait loci mapping), that utilizes the power of S-PLUS and both incorporates and extends the functionality of an exist- ing genetics suite. By providing scientists with an integrated set of tools for genomics experiments with a genetic component, more productive time can be spent interpreting the results rather than transforming data into different formats to be processed by multiple software analysis packages. This software should also address one of the most dif?cult aspects of genetical genomics exper- iments, the so called curse of dimensionality. As the genomics community continues gathering knowledge of transcripts in various organisms, the arrays that interrogate transcript abundance only grow larger in the number of transcript species included. In the absence of tools designed for this purpose, the research scientist is left with the option of either focusing on a narrow set of previously known genes or performing a grid-wise search on all genes in the array. The former is not interesting as these genes are likely well studied and may provide little novel insight. The latter is computationally demanding and may not be possible on the new, larger arrays. A recent publication presents a novel solution that may be enhanced to gain both power and scale using Bayesian methodology. Knowledge of how each genotype responds to a particular drug therapy is beneficial only in that one can identify portions of the population which cannot reap the benefits of said treatment. A better course of action is to identify not only which genotype responds, or not, to a particular therapy, but to identify which region of the genome is responding, or not, and how. We believe that the development of analytic tools for gene mapping experiments to identify this information will lead to new drug targets and better therapies that benefit a larger portion of the population.          n/a",Genetical Genomics Analysis Software,7216142,R43GM079852,"['Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Genetics', 'Anus', 'Arizona', 'Bioconductor', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cations', 'Cattle', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Con-fer', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Department of Defense', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Exons', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Government Agencies', 'Graph', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Nebraska', 'North Carolina', 'Numbers', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmaceutical Services', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Purpose', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Sus scrofa', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermogenesis', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'animal breeding', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'expression vector', 'genetic pedigree', 'hazard', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'lecturer', 'novel', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2007,101707,-0.004186791426711002
"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7234993,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2007,257655,-0.019886530436829485
"Accelerating metabolic discovery using characterization data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this project is to develop methods that will allow researchers to gain insight into the metabolic networks of organisms for which we have little or no high-throughput data. Such metabolic networks can reveal aspects of the organism's metabolism that might make it vulnerable to new or existing therapies. A core data set using genomic and other omic data from data-rich bacteria that are related to the organisms of interest will be assembled. The statistical tools needed to integrate these data and to infer metabolic networks using these core data plus characterization (phenotypic) data will then be built. Using the statistical inference algorithms, the characterization data can be leveraged to reveal the metabolic networks of data-poor bacteria for which we have only characterization data. This approach can eliminate the need for genome sequencing, gene expression experiments and the like for thousands of Gram-negative facultative rod bacteria (GNF). There are five tasks in the project: (1) assemble the data sets from data-rich organisms that will be used to inform the inference algorithm. These data include (a) the genomic sequences and annotation information, (b) extant pathway data and (c) gene expression data. All these data contain some level of information about the connectivity within the metabolic network; (2) process the genomic data to enhance its predictive value; (3) develop a data integration algorithm; (4) investigate modeling frameworks to be used for Bayesian data fusion and network inference; (5) validate the metabolic networks. Deliverables from this project should include: (1) a set of pathway genome databases for 35 GNF, This group includes 20 strains classified as category A or B biothreat agents, (2) a core dataset that integrates all the information we have relevant to the metabolic pathways in the 35 sequenced GNF, (3) a probabilistic graphical modeling framework capable of integrating disparate types of data and inferring networks from the integrated data, (4) a method for using characterization data, along with deliverables 2 and 3, to infer metabolic networks for bacterial strains for which we have only characterization data. The ability to rapidly construct models of metabolic networks means researchers will be able to respond to emerging infectious agents or biothreats more quickly.

"Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reverse engineering of cellular genetic circuits from gene expression data is an important and scientifically challenging problem. When applied to system more complex than a yeast cell, however, most of the approaches for reverse engineering are limited by their reliance on a significant number of ad-hoc perturbation, such as gene knockout.  We propose to address these issues and to attempt to reconstruct the genetic circuitry of human B-cells by coupling three distinct components: 1) an information theoretic method for the inference of cellular networks from microarray profile data for a large number of distinct cellular and molecular phenotypes 2) A synthetic network simulation framework for the assessment of the performance of the reverse engineering under a variety of constraints and conditions, such as noise and network complexity. 3) An adaptive learning method that will iteratively apply optimal perturbations to the biological system, which will allow refining the cellular network model over time.  Furthermore, we propose to biologically validate this approach by elucidating the cellular networks of human B lymphocytes, from a variety of normal, tumor-derived, and experimentally manipulated B cell phenotypes, which are significant both from an oncological and immunological perspective. This will be accomplished by analyzing an existing set of over 340 high-quality microarray expression profiles.  Finally, we will create a software platform to reverse engineer any biological system for which adequate microarray data is available. The platform will also allow to design and perform virtual, in-silico gene perturbation experiments. n/a",Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes,7082976,R01CA109755,"['B lymphocyte', 'artificial intelligence', 'cellular oncology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'cytogenetics', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression profiling', 'genetic models', 'human data', 'lymphoma', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular genetics', 'molecular oncology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,373483,-0.019512263200344285
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). The methods developed here will be applied to nearly 1500 haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) across approximately 300 cancer susceptibility genes measured in 542 subjects with bladder cancer and 745 healthy controls ascertained as part of a large epidemiological study from the state of New Hampshire.          n/a",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,7143682,R01LM009012,"['bladder neoplasm', 'clinical research', 'gene environment interaction', 'genes', 'genetics', 'genome', 'learning', 'model', 'neoplasm /cancer']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2006,319800,0.010882142954696822
"Statistical Methods for Genomic and Proteomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose developing, evaluating and comparing statistical methods in analyzing and interpreting microarray data, including a heart failure dataset collected in the co-Principal Investigator's lab. Some of the proposed methods will incorporate or be applied to other types of genomic or proteomic data. In Aim A.1, we consider detecting differential gene expression. A weighted permutation scheme is proposed to improve permutation-based inference procedures, and these methods will be compared with several recently proposed parametric and semi-parametric methods. We also propose incorporating existing biological data in the statistical methods. In Aim A.2, we study a clustering-based classification (CBC) method for gene function prediction using microarray data. CBC will be compared with other state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests. Other sources of biological data, such as protein-protein interaction data, will be incorporated in the proposed method. In Aim A.3, we consider sample classification and prediction based on gene expression profiles in a general framework called penalized partial least squares (PPLS).

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           n/a",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7146455,R01HG003618,"['clinical research', 'genes', 'genetics', 'human', 'model']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,306000,-0.0235640889639139
"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7095200,R01DA018341,"['Caenorhabditis elegans', 'behavior', 'bioinformatics', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'ethology', 'molecular biology information system', 'neurogenetics', 'phenotype']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2006,293309,0.01030824044873514
"Statistical Models in Epigenomics The primary objective of this proposal is to develop statistical models for the analysis of DNA methylation data.

We view DNA methylation patterns as an intermediate variable along a pathway from exposures to outcomes and take a flexible hierarchical modeling approach that can incorporate measured and unmeasured covariates.

These analytical tools will also be used to precisely define the long-term effects of neuroactive drugs on behavioral, opening the possibility of genetic screening for mutants with defects in tolerance and dependence. n/a",Machine vision analysis of nematode behavioral patterns.,6569575,R21DA015823,"['Caenorhabditis elegans', ' automated data processing', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' drug addiction', ' gene mutation', ' genetic screening', ' genome', ' invertebrate locomotion', ' mutant', ' neural transmission', ' neurophysiology', ' neuropsychology', ' nicotine', ' nicotinic receptors', ' phenotype', ' substance abuse related behavior']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,R21,2002,152000,0.006681641410090977

"INNOVATIVE ALGORITHMS FOR MICROARRAY ANALYSIS   DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Description)  In order to better understand the           vast quantity of microarray data currently being generated in a number of            laboratories, new computational and analysis tools are needed. Pattern               analysis of thousands of simultaneously expressed genes will provide insight         into novel and progressive disease treatments. With the use of information           technology tools, substantial opportunities exist for improving the ability to       identify genetic anomalies. These tools will be critical in advancing the            automation and interpretation of experimental results.                                                                                                                    We will develop an innovative computer-based analytical tool called                  MicroExplore that will bring together multiple methods for analysis of               microarray data. Each method has unique properties that produce conceptually         different results. In the first phase, we propose to compare conceptual              clustering, hierarchical agglomerative and k-means algorithms. Evaluation of         the quality of data will be assessed through a combination of factors that           measure how well-known functional groupings are reflected in the output.             Efficiency and scalability will be measured through timed runs of MicroExplore       on a set of expression datasets of various sizes. Our study will focus on the        complex dataset of lymphoid gene expression belonging to an intramural NCI           laboratory. In the second phase, a novel hybrid approach will be designed to         utilize the results of multiple clustering algorithms and configurations to          achieve a ranked set of best overall clusters. Attempts to integrate external        data sources will add new dimensions to the analysis tool and provide for            powerful predictions.                                                                                                                                                     Improving the scientist's ability to accurately and efficiently identify which       candidate genes would make good therapeutics will be a fundamental step for          the advancement of cancer research and scientific discovery. MicroExplore will       be a valuable resource for the continuance of gene discovery and                     characterization.

"CLASSIFICATION METHODS FOR DETECTING DISEASE LOCI DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract): Bold steps must be       taken to advance our understanding of the genetic and associated co-             variates affecting the inheritance of complex diseases. To that end, this        proposal will develop improved quantitative methods to detect genetic            factors contributing to increased susceptibility to complex disorders and        implement these methods in software for distribution to the research             community.                                                                                                                                                        The methods will concentrate on the use of classification techniques             applied to allele sharing data and other risk factors which affect the           trait. Allele sharing methods for mapping genes will be extended to              include the classification methods known as latent class models, cluster         analysis, and artificial neural networks, as well as a novel use of              logistic regression Co-variates such as gender, parental diagnosis, or           other concomitant factors will be systematically studied through                 applications to both stimulated and existing data sets. An additional goal       is to determine the optimal distribution of relative pairs (e.g. siblings,       first cousins) for these methods. Of great importance to this proposal is        the development of well-documented, user-friendly software and                   documentation which will be distributed to the scientific community via          the Internet. Existing software developed by the PI will be extensively          expanded for latent class models. Existing cluster analysis software will        be modified and combined for ease of use.                                                                                                                         This proposal consists of theoretical exploration, computer simulation,          data analysis, and software development. First, solutions of theoretical         questions relating to classification techniques will be pursued; second,         adaptation of computer programs to implement the analytic methods, and           investigation into alternative research strategies will be accomplished.         The new strategies will be applied to stimulated data, and finally, to           existing data sets of pedigrees in which a complex trait has been                diagnosed.

"MODELS IN POPULATION GENETICS The genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region control a variety          Of functions involved in the immune response, and influence                      susceptibility to over 40 diseases.  Our understanding of the structure          and function of the HLA genes, their disease associations, and the               evolutionary features of this multigene family has benefitted from recent        advances in molecular biology, immunology, disease modelling and                 population genetics.  Theoretical studies in the development of models to        determine the modes of inheritance of the HLA associated diseases have           led to a better understanding of the inheritance patterns in insulin             dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,           ankylosing spondylitis, hemochromatosis, celiac disease, and others.  It         is now clear that many of the HLA associated diseases involve                    heterogeneity in their HLA components, as well as non-HLA genetic                components.                                                                                                                                                       The specific aims of our research are to study the genetic components in         the etiology of the HLA associated diseases, and population genetic              features of the HLA system.  A variety of methods to test modes of               inheritance of diseases using marker allele information, will be                 developed.  Methods appropriate for the analysis of marker systems which         are not highly polymorphic, to both detect linkage and determine modes of        inheritance, will be investigated.  The information content of particular        pedigree types for LOD score analysis will be investigated.  Two methods         using patterns of linkage disequilibrium will be investigated to                 determine their usefulness in mapping disease predisposing genes.  A             number of large collaborative data sets of HLA associated diseases will          be analyzed.  A framework for genetic counselling of HLA associated, and         other complex diseases, will be developed.

"Deep learning for population genetics Project Summary The revolution in genome sequencing technologies over the past 15 years has created an explosion of population genomic data but has left in its wake a gap in our ability to make sense of data at this scale. In particular, whereas population genetics as a field has been traditionally data-limited, the massive volume of current sequencing means that previously unanswerable questions may now be within reach. To capitalize on this flood of information we need new methods and modes of analysis.  In the past 5 years the world of machine learning has been revolutionized by the rise of deep neural networks. These so-called deep learning methods offer incredible flexibility as well as astounding improvements in performance for a wide array of machine learning tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This proposal aims to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference.  In recent years our group has made great strides in using supervised machine learning for population genomic analysis (reviewed in Schrider and Kern 2018). However, this work has focused primarily on using more traditional machine learning methods such as random forests. As we argue in this proposal, DNA sequence data are particularly well suited for modern deep learning techniques, and we demonstrate that the application of these methods can rapidly lead to state-of-the-art performance in very difficult population genetic tasks such as estimating rates of recombination. The power of these methods for handling genetic data stems in part from their ability to automatically learn to extract as much useful information as possible from an alignment of DNA sequences in order to solve the task at hand, rather than relying on one or more predefined summary statistics which are generally problem-specific and may omit information present in the raw data.  In this proposal we lay out a systematic approach for both empowering the field with these tools and understanding their shortcomings. In particular, we propose to design deep neural networks for solving population genetic problems, and incorporate successful networks into user-friendly software tools that will be shared with the community. We will also investigate a variety of methods for estimating the uncertainty of predictions produced by deep learning methods; this area is understudied in machine learning but of great importance to biological researchers who require an accurate measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding an estimate. Finally, we will explore the impact of training data misspecification—wherein the data used to train a machine learning method differ systematically from the data to which it will be applied in practice. We will devise techniques to mitigate the impact of such misspecification in order to ensure that our tools will be robust to the complications inherent in analyzing real genomic data sets. Together, these advances have the potential to transform the methodological landscape of population genetic inference.

"Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) care based on clinical, imaging, genetic, and informatics principles. In the previous grant period, we have developed artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis, but real-world adoption has been limited by lack of prospective validation and by perception of these systems as “black boxes” that do not explain their rationale for diagnosis. Furthermore, although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. This renewal will address current gaps in knowledge in these areas. Our overall hypotheses are that developing a quantitative framework for ROP care using artificial intelligence and analytics will improve clinical disease management, that building “explainable” artificial intelligence systems will enhance clinical acceptance and educational opportunities, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, environmental, and genetic findings, in ROP will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and risk. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Evaluation performance of an artificial intelligence system for ROP diagnosis and screening prospectively. This will include: (a) recruit a target of over 2000 eye exams including wide-angle retinal images from 375 subjects at 5 centers, (b) optimize an image quality detection algorithm we have recently developed, and (c) analyze system accuracy for ROP diagnosis and screening (using a novel quantitative vascular severity scale). (2) Improve the interpretability of our existing artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis. This will include: (a) increase “explainability” of systems by combining deep learning with traditional feature extraction methods, (b) develop neural networks to identify changes between serial images, and (c) evaluate these methods through systematic feedback by experts. (3) Develop integrated models for ROP pathogenesis and risk. This will include: (a) build and improve ROP risk prediction models based on clinical, image, and demographic features, and (b) integrate genetic, imaging, clinical, and environmental variables through genetic risk prediction by machine learning, by investigating casual relationships with genetic variants and genetic risk scores, and by incorporating SNP associations with gene expression measurements to identify functional genes of ROP. Ultimately, these studies will significantly reduce barriers to adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence for clinicians, and will demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have worked successfully together for nearly 10 years, and who have expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics. Project Narrative ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the US and throughout the world, and the number of infants at risk for disease is increasing as the rate of premature birth rises. Rapidly-progressive changes associated with retinal vascular development may be visualized by clinical examination, captured by wide-angle imaging, and analyzed genetically. This project will develop, enhance, and validate artificial intelligence and analytic tools to help clinicians identify infants at risk for severe ROP using image analysis, genetic analysis, and integrative informatics that combines these factors – while also providing insight about disease pathogenesis.",Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity,9974137,R01EY019474,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Measurement', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Other Genetics', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'disorder risk', 'feature extraction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neovascular', 'neural network', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'real world application', 'recruit', 'retinal imaging', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'serial imaging']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,764279,-0.010328170194200924
"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10010243,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Capital', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phosphoramidite', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'research and development', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2020,374524,-0.01696631073715988
"Uncovering the epitranscriptome regulatory codes using machine learning Project Summary N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant methylation widely found in mRNAs of mammalian cells whose function is largely unknown. Recent research has accumulated increasingly strong evidence of m6A's involvement in different diseases such as leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, and AIDs. While m6A's close involvement in many diseases is apparent, mechanistic evidence linking m6A alterations to disease phenotypes is mostly missing. Most of the recent research is fueled by the high throughput sequencing technologies such as MeRIP-seq for transcriptome-wide profiling of m6A methylation. However, due to the innate limitations of such technologies, sophisticated machine learning based algorithms are urgently needed to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels and the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A. Without bridging these knowledge gaps, it is impossible to made inroads to the problem of finding m6A's role in regulating diseases. To address these issues, our aims in this proposal are 1) Establish a deep learning algorithm for base-resolution m6A site prediction; 2) Establish base- resolution m6A differential site prediction using a hierarchical Bayesian approach; and 3) Determine m6A- mediated genes and functions by Bayesian Negative-Binomial regression. The proposed research will employ deep learning and adversarial learned inference methods and utilize both methylation quantification and sequence information for the first time. Also, it will employ Bayesian graphical model-based methods for combining sequence and methylation level information. It is expected that the developed algorithms will have broad applications in functional study, for which we plan to closely work with our collaborators in applying these algorithms in their research of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which will lead to the fulfillment our long term goal in the eventual validation and practical medical application of m6A research in the future. Project Narrative  This project proposes to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels, the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A.

"Computational Methods for Next-Generation GWAS Project Summary/Abstract  Predicting phenotypes from DNA sequence variation is a major goal for genetics with potential applications in evolutionary biology, crop breeding, and public health. A central challenge in this task is separating genetic and environmental effects on phenotypes. In natural populations breeding structure is often correlated with the environment across space such that different subpopulations experience different environments. For genome-wide association studies (GWAS) this creates a problem: genetic and environmental effects can be confounded by population structure, leading to inflated test statistics and low predictive power across populations (Bulik-Sullivan et al. 2015, Mathieson and Mcvean, 2012). Understanding when association studies are biased by population stratification and creating better methods to correct for it are thus important challenges for population genetics over the next decade.  To identify conditions under which existing methods of population stratification correction are subject to bias and develop robust new alternatives suitable for use with the continental-scale genomic datasets that are now routinely available for humans, we propose to use simulations and machine learning to separate the signals of fine-scale ancestry from polygenic phenotype association. In our first aim we will develop simulations of polygenic phenotype evolution in continuous space and use the output to evaluate existing methods of stratification control including linear mixed models, PC correction, and LD score regression. In this aim we will seek to identify the regions of parameter space – i.e. the strength of isolation by distance and the spatial distribution of environmental variation – in which existing methods can be expected to produce reliable effect size estimates, and establish guidelines for applications of GWAS to structured populations.  We will then train machine learning algorithms on real genotype data from humans and mosquitoes to describe continuous structure in large spatial samples using a variational autoencoder, a dimensionality reduction technique based on deep neural networks that can take advantage of both allele frequency and haplotype-based measures of differentiation in a single analysis and thus offer improved control of stratification inflation in GWAS relative to the now standard PCA regression approach. Last we will apply deep learning techniques to the problem of linking phenotypes and genotypes in structured samples by training neural networks on simulated phenotypes and empirical genetic data. By training our networks on empirical genetic data and incorporating contextual information about surrounding haplotype structure into the model, our networks should learn to discriminate causal associations from false positives created by population structure in the sample cohort, which will improve performance when attempting to identify associations with the real phenotype. These methods will be applied to existing genomic datasets of height in humans, tested against the current state-of-the-art approaches, and packaged as scalable software for the broader scientific community. Project Narrative Separating the signals of polygenic trait association and population structure has emerged as a major challenge for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We propose to develop new simulations of populations evolving in continuous space that will allow us to rigorously benchmark existing methods of stratification control in GWAS while fully controlling the underlying demographic and selective process. We will then apply deep learning techniques to develop (1) a new method of dimensionality reduction to test as a covariate for ancestry in GWAS, and (2) a neural network that identifies genotype-phenotype connections while controlling for population structure in the sample cohort.",Computational Methods for Next-Generation GWAS,9910009,F32GM136123,"['Agriculture', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Height', 'Human', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oligogenic Traits', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polygenic Traits', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Variant', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'large scale simulation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'polygenic risk score', 'population stratification', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F32,2020,19290,-0.01244403580215762
"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,10022122,F32GM134595,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fellowship', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Freedom', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'base', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human data', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical sciences', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,67446,-0.006144649180925568
"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10051655,R01HG010881,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'feature extraction', 'feedforward neural network', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'modifiable risk', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'personalized intervention', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,790452,-0.01852827916187178
"Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research is to discover neurobiologically interpretable gene networks for addiction, specifically for cigarettes and opioids. To achieve this goal, we will apply a new multi-omics, multi-method framework—Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetII)—to identify gene networks associated uniquely with cigarette or opioid outcomes and networks shared across these addictions. GNetII includes genome-wide epistasis, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, gene network construction, and Lines-of-Evidence methods. These cornerstone methods will enable integration of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in living subjects, postmortem human brain data (RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and variant genotypes) from addiction case and control decedents (deceased individuals), and public omics data. Cigarette smoking and opioid outcomes are genetically correlated, and we have parallel GWAS and multi-omics brain data available in two highly relevant tissues, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, for both of these addictions. Cigarettes and opioids are leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. These addictions affect millions of U.S. adults and youths and are highly heritable (e.g., 54% and 71% for opioid addiction and nicotine dependence, respectively). GWAS analyses have identified 300+ loci at genome-wide significance for smoking. GWAS for opioids are farther behind in sample size, but genome-wide significant loci are emerging. Neurobiological effects of known loci are largely unknown, and more loci and connections among the loci are still to be discovered. We hypothesize that applying new big data science methods to large-scale GWAS and gene regulation data in brain tissue will reveal previously undetected relationships (such as epistatic interactions between genes) and add knowledge of the neurobiology underlying addiction. We propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Integrate multi-omics data to discover cigarette-associated gene networks.  Aim 2: Integrate multi-omics data to discover opioid-associated gene networks.  Aim 3: Integrate multi-omics data to find general addiction-associated gene networks. For cigarettes, Aims 1 and 3 will leverage GWAS (N=528,259) and multi-omics data in postmortem human brain from active smoker and nonsmoker decedents (N=262). For opioids, Aims 2 and 3 will use GWAS (N=49,178) and multi-omics brain data from opioid overdose case and control decedents (N=147). Analyses will be performed on Summit, the world's fastest supercomputer, which will greatly improve the likelihood of neurobiologically meaningful discoveries.

"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,10018936,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,350896,0.007608848229948408
"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns,10022173,K23NS110927,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Archives', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Physiology', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lobar', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'arteriole', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain parenchyma', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypertension control', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'risk variant', 'serial imaging', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,178809,-0.018966101457554868
"A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning SUMMARY Adaptive evolution (AE) is both a “force of good” as it can help to optimize biological processes in industry, but it is also a “force of frustration” when infectious diseases exploit AE to escape the host immune system or become resistant to drugs. It has long been assumed close to impossible to make predictions on AE due to the presumed predominating influences of random forces and events. However, the observation that evolutionary repeatability across traits and species is far more common than previously thought, suggests that AE, with the right data and approach, may become (partially) predictable. Indeed, we found through experiments with the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae on its response to antibiotics and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, that in order to make AE predictable a detailed understanding of at least two aspects of the bacterial system are required: 1.) the genetic constraints of the system (i.e. the architecture of the organismal network); and 2.) where and how in the system stress is experienced and processed. We showed that by mapping out ~25% of the bacterium's network, determining phenotypic and transcriptional antibiotic responses, applying network analyses to capture and quantify the responses in a network context, and exploiting experimental evolution to pin-point adaptive mutations in the genome it becomes possible, by means of machine learning, to uncover hidden patterns in the data that make AE predictions feasible. This means that the network in interaction with the environment shapes the adaptive landscape, it limits available solutions and makes some solutions more likely than others, thereby driving repeatability and enabling predictability. In this proposal we build on these exciting developments with the goal to map out the constraints of S. pneumoniae's entire network and develop a machine learning model that can forecast adaptive evolution a priori, and on a genome-wide scale. To accomplish this, we combine in aim 1 parts of Tn-Seq, dTn-Seq and Drop-Seq to finalize a new tool Tn-Seq^2 (Tn-Seq squared) that is able to map genetic-interactions in high-throughput and genome-wide. We use Tn-Seq^2 to reconstruct the first genome-wide genetic interaction network for S. pneumoniae in the presence of 20 antibiotics. In aim 2 we create 85 HA-tagged Transcription factor induction (TFI) strains and: a) Determine with ChIP-Seq the DNA-binding sites for all 85 TFs in S. pneumoniae; b) By overexpressing each TFI strain followed by RNA- Seq we determine each TFs regulatory signature; c) Use a Transcriptional Regulator Induced Phenotype screen in the presence of 20 antibiotics to untangle environment specific links between genetic and transcriptional perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes. Lastly, in aim 3, we train and test a variety of machine learning approaches to design an optimal model that predicts which genes in the genome are most likely to adapt in the presence of a specific antibiotic. The development of this predictive AE model, will not only be useful in predicting the emergence of antibiotic resistance, but the strategy should be valuable for most any biological field for which adaptive changes are important, ranging from biological engineering to cancer. NARRATIVE Adaptive evolution (AE) is the driving force behind the emergence of antibiotic resistance and if it were possible to predict AE before it happens, it could help in preventing resistance. Here we use cutting-edge existing and newly designed genomics tools and analytical approaches to develop a machine learning model that can predict AE a priori, and on a genome-wide scale.",A priori adaptive evolution predictions for antibiotic resistance through genome-wide network analyses and machine learning,10049219,R01AI148470,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomass', 'ChIP-seq', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Fermentation', 'Frustration', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Industry', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photosynthesis', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Shapes', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Yeasts', 'design', 'driving force', 'droplet sequencing', 'emerging antibiotic resistance', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic architecture', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIAID,BOSTON COLLEGE,R01,2020,391250,-0.010491611393165083
"Mobile Genetic Elements and Clinical Outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious public health threats facing society. Significantly, the vast majority of acquired AMR genes are carried on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which include plasmids, insertion sequences, and transposons. One of the most important hospital and community-associated pathogens harboring resistance genes is Staphylococcus aureus, which causes more than 80,000 infections and 11,000 deaths each year in the United States. S. aureus readily acquire MGEs, which encompass more than 20% of the genome for most strains, and these elements have been central to the establishment and broad spread of resistance to antibiotics such as oxacillin and vancomycin. Additionally, S. aureus is capable of causing a wide range of infections, including bacteremia, with a mortality rate up to 30%. Utilizing an unparalleled collection of S. aureus strains from a cohort of patients in Central and South America with bacteremia, I seek to develop a framework for the identification and comparison of circulating MGEs through the use of bacterial phylogenetics, clinical epidemiology, and machine learning. This dataset will serve as the foundation for my training to become an independent scientist. To begin interrogating this exceptional strain collection, we have generated Illumina short-read whole genome sequencing data on 1,087 S. aureus bacteremia isolates to identify MGEs, and will leverage novel ultra-long read sequencing methodologies to fully characterize the position and variations of these elements. The three aims within this proposal are designed to elucidate the role of MGEs in driving the genetic diversification of endemic S. aureus clades, and identify if they serve as adaptation hotspots when put under selective pressure from the host immune system or antibiotics. First, I will characterize the repertoire of MGEs within this large cohort of isolates and apply gene-order and Bayesian time-measured phylogenetics to identify the predominant MGEs within each clade and how frequently they are acquired and lost. Second, I will assess the MGE diversity within isolates collected serially from the same individual. I hypothesize these MGEs will be the primary variation points and will be more important than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the adaptation to selective pressures such as antibiotics. Third, I will identify the clinical (age, BMI, and present comorbidities) and genomic (SNPs, MGEs, and genes) features that are predictive of the 30-day mortality in the predominant clades of S. aureus within our dataset. I theorize these genetic and clinical signatures will be different for each clade as they possess different repertoires of MGEs. The Center for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics in The University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston has a firm commitment to understanding and reducing AMR and AMR infections. This provides an exceptional environment to conduct my research elucidating the role of MGEs in the clinical outcomes of S. aureus bacteremia, and to develop as an investigator and participate in the training offered to make the transition to independence. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on health has been recognized as one of the most serious global public health threats facing our society. This proposal aims to clarify the role mobile genetic elements play in transmitting antimicrobial resistance and driving genetic diversity within endemic Staphylococcus aureus lineages causing bacteremia.

"Conceptualizing Actionability in Clinical Genomic Screening Project Summary/Abstract. Clinical genomic sequencing (CGS) produces large amounts of data, much of which is hard to characterize or may have a negligible influence on health. The concept of actionability is commonly used to help separate information that may be useful from information that is likely irrelevant for patients. Actionability directs attention to whether genomic information warrants action and reflects its initial development as a strategy to augment diagnosis and treatment in sick patients. As CGS expands towards healthy populations in primary care settings, actionability is still widely embraced despite little consensus regarding its definition and use. Because this ambiguity could become an obstacle to the successful implementation of clinical genomic sequencing in healthy populations, greater clarity about this concept is necessary. The proposed research will fulfill this need by characterizing the emergence and varied meanings of actionability in clinical genomics, focusing on clinical genomics' transition into primary care settings. By identifying underlying values and assumptions related to actionability, this research will push beyond definitional disputes and provide a deeper framework for assessing how genetic information is valued. The specific aims are: 1. Identify and characterize, through in-depth interviews, how genomics experts and primary care providers conceptualize what makes genomic information actionable for healthy populations. 2. Identify and characterize, through a natural language processing (NLP) analysis of published literature, how the concept of actionability emerged, spread, and is used throughout clinical genomics. 3. Convene a workshop with genomics experts, primary care providers, and ELSI scholars to produce a white paper on actionability and the ethical, effective integration of CGS into primary care, guided by the results from Aims 1 and 2. This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award includes a highly-structured, mentored training program that will support the candidate's goal to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI investigator focused on assessing the value of genomic information.

Receive training in genetic and genomic science to facilitate collaboration with genomics care teams and make scientifically accurate policy recommendations 2. Build new methodological skills in biomedical informatics and natural language processing to conduct generalizable research 3. Publish and engage with scientific and medical audiences to have a more direct impact on future guidelines and policies. 4. Develop a collaborative and interdisciplinary research network. This training will include coursework, guided readings, network building, and sustained mentorship by a highly-qualified team of faculty with expertise in ELSI research, bioethics, clinical genomics, biomedical informatics, and the history and sociology of medicine. This training will prepare the candidate to transition to an independent ELSI investigator focused on ethical issues related to the actionability of genomic health information – an ELSI research priority in Genetic and Genomic Healthcare.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,9886261,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Community Medicine', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'data preservation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,371859,-0.010615092019225277
"Advancing Multi-Omics and Electronic Health Records Computational Methodologies PROJECT SUMMARY  Phenomic advances from large-scale electronic health records (EHR) linked to DNA biobanks have pioneered an efficient approach to genetic discovery that has transformed human genetic studies, with the enormous potential to provide constraints on relevant biological mechanisms on a wide spectrum of human phenotypes. Nevertheless, our understanding of the downstream molecular consequences of genetic associations remains limited and impedes our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases. Given their enormous discovery potential for human genomics and precision medicine, genetic analyses in diverse populations offer unprecedented opportunities to identify causal genetic mechanisms underlying human trait variation.  This research proposal aims to address these convergent developments and critical gaps and to exert a powerful influence on efforts to expand our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Here we hypothesize that a comprehensive multi- omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology will provide a robust and rigorous framework. This proposal thus has the following aims: AIM 1: Develop a regularized regression based methodology and a deep learning framework to improve characterization of the genetic architecture of gene expression and to build robust prediction models, extending a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methodology (called PrediXcan) that we developed. AIM 2: Develop statistical causal modeling of trait-associated genetic variation through a convergent TWAS and Mendelian Randomization approach and apply it to thousands of human traits with available GWAS and EHR data. AIM 3: Develop analytic approaches and software tools to further genetic analyses in admixed and multi-ethnic populations and to lay the groundwork for trans-ethnic multi-omic methodologies, using EHR data (e.g., BioVU, UK Biobank, All of Us). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE We will develop a comprehensive multi-omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology that bridges the gap between Genetic Epidemiology and Functional Genomics. This research provides a rigorous framework for investigating relevant mechanisms underlying complex traits, including disease risk and quantitative traits.

"A next-generation morbid map of the human genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) on gene discovery and molecular diagnostics for Mendelian conditions (MCs) is hard to overstate. However, to provide affected individuals with precise natural history, recurrence risk, and prognosis in clinical settings, identification of pathogenic variant(s)/genotypes alone is often insufficient. This is a challenge most notably for genes that cause more than one MC or ~25% of all genes that underlie MCs. In such an instance, even with a known genotype a patient's phenotype has to be compared to that of all MCs caused by variants in a gene to determine which MC, if any, is the likely diagnosis or whether patient instead has a novel condition. This comparison is increasingly difficult because delineation of the ~5,100 MCs currently known has typically been based on subjective grouping of affected individuals by phenotypic similarity. We propose to develop a quantitative framework for assessing overlap among the distributions of phenotypes due to pathogenic genotypes the same gene and apply this framework genome-wide. NGS has enabled identification of causal genotypes in hundreds of thousands of individuals with MCs, providing a sufficiently large dataset that it is now feasible to use machine learning to quantitatively and systematically identify “clusters” of co-occurring genotypes and phenotypic features for each known gene. We will refine and validate our approach by comparing differences between conventionally-delineated and quantitatively-delineated MCs and by assessing the similarity of individuals with well-studied atypical phenotypes/genotypes to quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will then apply the optimal strategy across the genome to generate a “next- generation morbid map” based on quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will also apply machine learning approaches to identify genomic properties associated with the propensity for each gene to underlie multiple MCs (i.e., the numeric contribution of each gene to the morbid map or phenotropy). This will enable a more precise and complete understanding of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of each MC, enable more objective diagnosis of individuals with atypical phenotypes, and more robustly identify the existence of multiple MCs among individuals with non-specific “class” phenotypes (e.g., developmental delay, autism, hearing impairment). We will make all newly developed methods publicly available via interactive and programmatic web-based tools to facilitate extension of this work to other human and model organism datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of this project are to develop a quantitative framework that enables objective delineation of Mendelian conditions, apply the framework to systematically delineate conditions across all genes known to underlie a Mendelian condition, and predict the number of conditions due to each gene. This framework will provide a fuller, unbiased characterization of the genotypic/phenotypic spectrum for all Mendelian conditions, enable more precise diagnoses and counseling of individuals with difficult to diagnose phenotypes, and accelerate the detection of new Mendelian conditions.",A next-generation morbid map of the human genome,10047366,R35HG011297,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'hearing impairment', 'large datasets', 'molecular diagnostics', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2020,466172,-0.010510783220611795
"Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa Project Summary/Abstract Background: A major challenge in evolutionary genomics is to characterize the forces shaping present-day patterns of genetic variation. For instance, the extent and manner in which natural selection affects genetic diversity remains highly controversial. Researchers have largely addressed this problem by developing statistical tests or summaries of genome sequence variation that provide insights into the evolutionary forces at play. However, because such approaches typically rely on a single univariate summary of the data, valuable discriminatory information present in the original dataset is lost. A more fruitful strategy would thus be to use multidimensional summaries of genomic data (e.g. a large vector of summary statistics) or even the totality of the input data (e.g. a matrix-representation of a sequence alignment) to make more accurate inferences. An even more powerful approach is to utilize data sets in which the same population is sampled at multiple time points, allowing one to observe evolutionary dynamics in action. Although such genomic time-series data are becoming more prevalent, the development of appropriate computational methodologies has lagged behind the proliferation of such data. Proposal: The Schrider Lab seeks to develop and apply powerful machine learning methods for evolutionary inference. Our work over the next five years will yield powerful software tools leveraging novel representations of genomic datasets, including time-series data. These efforts will dramatically improve researchers' ability to make accurate evolutionary inferences from both population genomic and phylogenetic data. Indeed, preliminary results demonstrate that our methods vastly outperform current approaches in evolutionary genetics. More importantly, we will use these tools to answer pressing evolutionary questions. In particular, our use of time-series data will reveal loci responsible for recent adaptation with much greater confidence than currently possible. Our efforts will help to resolve the controversy over the role of adaptation in shaping patterns of diversity across the human genome. This research has important implications for public health as well, as genes underlying recent adaptations are enriched for disease-associations. Moreover, we are constructing a time-series dataset in the mosquito vector species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We will interrogate these data for evidence of recent and ongoing adaptation—this work will reveal loci responsible for the evolution of resistance to insecticides and other control efforts. Encouraging preliminary data also suggest that our work in phylogenetics will substantially improve inferential power in this important research area. More broadly, the success of the novel approaches described in this proposal has the potential to transform the methodological landscape of evolutionary genomic data analysis. Project Narrative The work proposed here seeks to develop and apply powerful machine-learning based software tools for evolutionary genetic inference in humans, mosquito vectors, and other species. Such efforts have important health implications, as they can identify genes involved in adaptation, which in humans are often associated with disease and in mosquitos are often associated with resistance to insecticides and other control efforts.",Advancing evolutionary genetic inference in humans and other taxa,10028474,R35GM138286,"['Address', 'Aedes', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Insecticides', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Selections', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'statistics', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'vector', 'vector mosquito']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2020,382894,-0.0070305522740139
"Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) Project Summary/Abstract  The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have enabled the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of disease phenotypes, at the tissue and even the single cell level. This has allowed development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients. Thus, new genomic science educational initiatives need to be continually updated to educate the clinical and translational workforce on how to effectively interpret and apply the findings from genomics studies. Patients of providers who have participated in these educational initiatives also benefit as it allows for more rapid integration of genomic study findings into the clinical care setting. Thus, in response to PAR-19-185, we propose to develop and implement the Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) program that will not only focus on the analysis of genomic data, but also on gene-expression data, the integration of these two data types, as well as introductory theory and application of statistical and machine learning methods. Specifically we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Develop and successfully implement the online and in-person phases of CREiGS to increase the methodologic ingenuity by which researchers tackle important genomics-related clinical problems. 2. Establish a Diversity Recruitment External Advisory Board to ensure that the most effective strategies are employed to recruit URM doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from academic institutions nationwide into CREiGS. 3. Enhance the dissemination phase of CREiGS by packaging and uploading the asynchronous lectures and the online critical thinking/problem solving assessments with solutions for publicly available, online teaching resources. 4. Implement effective methods to evaluate the efficacy of CREiGS by examining:1) the participants' grasp of the CREiGS core competencies, 2) the clarity and quality of the curriculum, 3) program logistics and operation, and 4) the participants' short-term and long-term success attributed to participation in CREiGS. In summary, we posit that CREiGS will provide participants with a solid foundation in genomics science to answer complex, clinical questions. We believe that CREiGS supports the mission of the NHGRI by providing researchers with rigorous training to “accelerate medical breakthroughs that improve human health.” Project Narrative The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have allowed for the development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients.

"Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits Project Summary  Over the past decade, data generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to analyze heritability of human diseases and complex traits to improve understanding of genetic architecture, including identifying the genetic variants associated with diseases and their effect sizes. These heritability enrichment analyses have revealed underlying biological mechanisms such as regulatory elements involved in disease pathways. This research proposes statistical methods and analysis to formally assess the contribution of biological pathways, gene networks, and re-prioritized functional annotations to the genetic architecture of 94 human diseases and complex traits. Better understanding of disease architecture will improve genome-wide associations and fine mapping and provides robust inference of disease etiology and mechanisms.  The first aim is to determine the contribution of disease-associated gene pathways to disease heritability. It is well known that an abnormality in individual genes rarely causes a human disease. Large-scale pathway analysis will elucidate disease pathways by constructing functional annotations and applying an existing polygenic method to partition heritability. Furthermore, pathway analyses on candidate genes identified via whole-exome sequencing (WES) data will inform new biological inference. The resulting set of enriched pathway-trait pairs will further help with independent validation of previously reported associations and for novel associations enriched for trait heritability.  The second aim is to determine the contribution of gene network to disease heritability across 94 diseases, focusing on hub genes defined by a broad set of network connectivity metrics. The contribution of gene network to disease heritability has been only partially answered, limited to few network connectivity metrics across 42 diseases. Comprehensive analysis of gene sets informed by published gene networks will inform a new direction of integrating gene networks to infer biological mechanisms of human diseases. In addition, visualization method for large-scale gene networks will greatly enhance research translation, serving as a useful resource for studying gene-gene interactions for potential drugs and therapeutic targets.  The third aim is to de-noise and re-prioritize Mendelian annotations to infer candidate genes. Despite considerable process on prioritizing rare variants impacting Mendelian diseases, little is known about the utility of these Mendelian pathogenicity scores for common disease. I will conduct heritability enrichment analyses to answer informativeness of Mendelian disease pathogenicity scores for common disease. To further improve their informativeness, I propose a machine learning variant reprioritization framework. Ultimately, this project will produce (1) a detailed understanding of disease-associated biological pathways to disease heritability, (2) a set of functional annotations informed by gene networks significantly enriched for disease heritability, and (3) a new method to prioritize variants and identifying candidate genes based on diverse genomic features. Project Narrative Understanding human genetic variations, from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to mutations, offers a great potential in uncovering underlying disease mechanisms by identifying new disease-associated genes and in discovering potential drug targets and therapeutics. This proposed studies aim to understand the role of these genetic variations in trait heritability, leveraging disease-associated biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations. The developed method to prioritize variants and genes will answer the contribution of gene pathways, gene sets informed by gene networks, and Mendelian pathogenicity scores to disease heritability.","Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits",9990520,F31HG010818,"['Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'denoising', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'fitness', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'open source', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2020,45520,-0.028784208481498368
"Leveraging Common Fund data for feature selection in Kids First studies. Project Abstract This project will pilot a process for identifying multi-variant interactions contributing structural birth defect and childhood cancer disorders. This study will focus on analysis of oral-facial clefts, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and congenital heart defects from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from family cohorts taken from Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project (KF).  Typically, tests to link disorders to genome-wide complex multivariate associations are computationally prohibitive. Thus, a first step to making such analyses more reasonable is to limit the number of variables (genes, variants) being tested together. We can reduce the number of possible tests by restricting what data should be tested. This study will seek to reduce the data for testing by utilizing biological knowledge from other two Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. KOMP2 has generated extensive information on mouse knockout developmental phenotypes relevant for matching gene and phenotypes in KF WGS studies. GTEx can be merged with KF loci and relevant tissue-to-phenotype relationships. Thus, using features from other Common Fund data and annotations, we can generate selected subsets of KF variants and genes as feature-reduced KF data.  A comprehensive machine learning (ML) analysis pipeline will then be utilized for the identification of candidate risk factors and characterization of complex patterns of association between these feature-reduced KF data. In addition to performing the more traditional univariate association analyses of genotype vs. phenotype, this pipeline will also identify complex associations including (1) context-dependent genetic effects resulting from non-additive multi-variant interactions, i.e. epistasis, and (2) subgroup-specific associations, i.e. by phenotype and genotypic heterogeneity, where different etiological paths lead to the same/similar phenotypes in the selected KF subject group. This pipeline will include feature selection, modeling, and interpretation of multi-variant interactions.  The outcomes of this study will include (1) pipelines for integrating Common Fund data into Kids First datasets, (2) integrated KF-KOMP2-GTEx datasets including cross-species integration, (3) ML pipelines for multi-variant interaction analyses of phenotype vs genotype in selected, reduced-feature KF data, and (4) results from the aforementioned pipelines for multi-variant interactions for later hypothesis testing. Project Abstract This project will pilot a process for identifying interactions between genetic variants that contribute to structural birth defect and childhood cancer disorders by combining data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project with biological knowledge from other two Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.

"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",9983094,R01GM134056,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Complement', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Homeostasis', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Model', 'Plants', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Toxin', 'Transgenes', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biophysical properties', 'bisulfite', 'density', 'epigenetic memory', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'trait', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2020,319720,-0.01575989019147493
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets.

"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed understanding of admixture is essential for effective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on phenotype are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simplified models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This proposal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to leverage this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate powerful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as effectively as homogeneous populations. The first step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statistical framework to infer fine-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop effective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major impact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to efficiently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human phenotypes, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on fine-scale genomic structure and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can benefit from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,9990809,R35GM125055,"['Admixture', 'Alleles', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic evolution', 'insight', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structural genomics', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2020,332952,0.009290447042075184
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9916801,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'diverse data', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,341471,-0.03785684534417035
"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggset that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcripition in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields. Project Narrative Diaphragmatic hernias and cardiovascular malformations are serious birth defects. In this study, we will use bioinformatics and mouse models to identify genes that cause these birth defects and to learn how they work. These experiments will help us to understand how the diaphragm and heart form prior to birth and may ultimately lead to new ways of treating or preventing these birth defects.",Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development,9972190,R01HD098458,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Association Learning', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital diaphragmatic hernia', 'Cytogenetics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diaphragmatic Hernia', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Encyclopedias', 'Endocardium', 'Endothelium', 'Foundations', 'GATA4 gene', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Hernia', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Mesenchymal', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Role', 'SOX7 gene', 'Source', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'WNT4 gene', 'Work', 'biochip', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cardiogenesis', 'congenital anomaly', 'data modeling', 'dosage', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'genome database', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'microdeletion', 'molecular sequence database', 'mortality', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'research study', 'septal defect', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web based interface']",NICHD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,457528,-0.014131973654081077
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,9893003,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2020,336445,-0.00806619603052847
"Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes Project summary In contract to sexual organisms, the mechanisms of population genetics in bacteria are far less understood. Two fundamental aspects of bacterial population genetics remain sorely understudied: i) the impact of DNA exchange on the evolution of bacterial genomes and populations is largely unknown. ii) the prominence of adaptive evolution has not been comprehensively assessed in bacteria. Determining how recombination and adaptive evolution impact bacteria is key to understand the biology of these organisms and to develop relevant models of their evolution. Although bacteria reproduce clonally, there is increasing evidence that the vast majority of these organisms are capable of homologous recombination by exchanging pieces of DNA in a process similar to gene conversion in animals and plants. This process enhances microbial capacity to adapt to stresses or changing environments and the exchange of DNA between bacterial strains is a major concern for human health as exemplified by the transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite the central role of this process, the rates and patterns of recombination remain unresolved in bacteria. The extent of recombination often varies greatly from one study to another and, as a result, the same bacterial species can be perceived as clonal in one study and highly recombining in another. In this project, we propose to re-evaluate the landscape of recombination rates and patterns along the genomes of hundreds of bacterial species. Using new methodological frameworks based on Approximate Bayesian Computation and Deep Learning, we will identify the factors shaping the variation in recombination rate across bacteria. We will also uncover recombination rate variation across bacterial chromosomes (i.e. hot spots and cold spots). Our rate estimates will also allow us to study how recombination drives the evolution of genomic architecture of bacteria, including turnover in gene content. Finally, we will quantify the impact of adaptive evolution in bacteria, which may be substantially larger than in other organisms due to large bacterial effective population sizes. We will also investigate the relationship between adaptation and recombination, and identify the genes/pathways responsible for adaptation. In summary, this study will evaluate the rates and patterns of recombination across hundreds of species, determine the factors driving the evolution of the recombination process, reveal the role of adaptive evolution in bacteria, and the interplay between recombination and adaptation. Project narrative Homologous recombination and adaptive evolution are key mechanisms driving bacterial adaptation to new environments and new treatments. The proposed study aims to apply new approaches to determine the rates and patterns of recombination across genomic data in order to identify the factors shaping the rates and landscapes of recombination as well as the impact of adaptive evolution on bacteria. Upon completion, this project will provide a global view of the interplay between recombination and adaptative evolution across hundreds of bacterial species.",Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes,9968563,R01GM132137,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Chromosomes', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Contracts', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Fibrinogen', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Spottings', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'gene function', 'genome analysis', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'homologous recombination', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'novel strategies', 'resistance gene', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO,R01,2020,294378,-0.0036440956227814735
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9979887,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,400001,-0.018884100189377643
"Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits Project Summary Deeper understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and implicated biological mechanisms across populations is essential for equitable precision medicine implementation and can only be accomplished by studying the genetic architecture of complex traits in diverse populations. In our initial project period, we have shown that genetic correlation of gene expression depends on shared ancestry proportions in African American, Hispanic, and European populations. We identified a subset of genes that are well-predicted in one population, but poorly predicted in another and showed these differences are due to allele frequency differences between populations. Our results demonstrate that when comparing predicted expression levels to the observed, a balance of the training population with ancestry similar to the test population and total sample size leads to optimal predicted gene expression. Our studies of lipid traits in Yoruba, Filipino and Hispanic populations uncovered key genes likely regulated by variants that are monomorphic or rare in European populations, demonstrating why studies in diverse populations are crucial. We have optimized genetic prediction models of gene expression levels in diverse populations and thus have broadened the scope of PrediXcan. In this proposal, we seek to (1) optimize global and local ancestry-aware omics trait prediction models within and across diverse populations and (2) predict the intermediate omics traits and perform poly- omic PrediXcan analyses of complex traits in GWAS cohorts from diverse populations. We have gathered data of multiple omics traits from diverse populations for this project (genome-wide genotype, RNA-Seq, methylomics, metabolomics, and microbiome). We will use machine learning to optimize genotypic prediction models of gene expression levels, splicing ratios, methylation, metabolite levels, and microbial diversity. We expect a range of predictive power will be observed across omics traits dependent on the heritability of each trait and differences in allele frequencies and effect sizes among populations. We will integrate regulatory data and previous results from larger European populations when appropriate to prioritize functional variants in our prediction models. For each omics trait, we will survey its genetic architecture to inform the best prediction models. Our models will account for global and local ancestry and we will quantify the ancestry specific components of each omics trait. We will test the predicted omics traits for association with phenotypes of interest using either raw genotypes or summary statistics. We will use colocalization methods to determine if the SNPs driving each omics trait prediction model are also those most associated with the phenotype and thus most likely to be causal. We will combine predicted omics traits in poly-omic models to determine which genes and biological pathways are implicated for a particular phenotype. Our team is well positioned to perform novel PrediXcan-based analyses of omics traits in diverse populations and promises to maximize impact by making our scripts, models, and results publicly available. Project Narrative Differences in DNA sequence among individuals can lead to differences in omics traits like gene expression, splicing, methylation, metabolite levels, and microbial diversity, which in turn can lead to trait differences. We have developed a method that harnesses DNA differences to predict omics traits, which are then tested for association with a disease or other trait of interest. Our project will lead to a better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results across populations, which has the potential to improve the implementation of precision medicine among diverse populations and reduce health disparities.",Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits,9880471,R15HG009569,"['Adopted', 'African American', 'Authorship', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Balance training', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Catalogs', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Disease', 'European', 'Filipino', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publishing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Variant', 'base', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'epidemiological model', 'epigenomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'methylomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'undergraduate student']",NHGRI,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R15,2020,436000,-0.019124026250806034
"Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are a cause of premature deaths, responsible for up to 8% of sudden deaths in industrialized countries. Identifying individuals at risk for TAAD allows for medical management that prevents deaths due to dissections. We determined that up to 20% of TAAD patients without a known genetic syndrome have a family history of TAAD, which is inherited primarily in an autosomal dominant manner (termed heritable thoracic aortic disease, HTAD). We established a cohort of HTAD families (842 families with two or more members with TAAD) and used this cohort to identify novel HTAD genes. Positional cloning and candidate gene approaches by our lab and others have successfully identified 18 genes for HTAD. We hypothesize that there are multiple altered genes yet to be identified, disrupting known and novel molecular pathways responsible for thoracic aortic disease, and responsible for disease in the unsolved HTAD families. The overarching goal of the project is to identify the remaining genes for HTAD, characterize the phenotype associated with these novel genes, perform initial molecular studies linking the mutant gene to aortic disease, and rapidly translate these findings into improved clinical care and prevention of premature deaths due to aortic dissection in HTAD families. The proposed aims are: (1) Recruit and characterize additional HTAD families to be used to identify novel genes, and delineate the clinical features and mutation spectrum associated with new genes; (2) Pursue exome/genome sequencing on HTAD cases and use the genetic strategies to identify novel genes, including segregation of rare variants in affected relatives and trios (affected proband and unaffected parents) and burden analyses; (3) Pursue a machine-learning approach using exome data from HTAD families and controls to identify novel disease genes; (4) Perform initial molecular and cellular biology studies of novel HTAD genes to confirm a link between the mutant gene and thoracic aortic disease. In summary, we are uniquely poised to identify novel HTAD genes using our assembled cohort and are proposing both proven and novel strategies to identify additional HTAD genes. Uncovering HTAD genes is crucial for identifying individuals at risk for aortic dissections and initiating gene-specific clinical management to prevent premature death due to dissections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute aortic dissections are a common cause of premature death in the United States. The goal of the proposed research is to prevent premature deaths due to dissections by identifying individuals who are predisposed by uncovering all the genetic variants in the human genome that trigger dissection.",Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections,10053081,R01HL109942,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Survival', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dissection', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FBN1', 'FOXE3 gene', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'LOX gene', 'LTBP2 gene', 'Link', 'MADH4 gene', 'MYH11 gene', 'MYLK gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Medical', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Sudden Death', 'Surgical Management', 'Syndrome', 'TGFB2 gene', 'TGFBR1 gene', 'TGFBR2 gene', 'Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'family management', 'gene discovery', 'genetic approach', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'positional cloning', 'premature', 'prevent', 'proband', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'segregation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,653552,-0.03509069335097422
"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,9894766,R01AR073882,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cadaver', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Harvest', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of shoulder region', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Seeds', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'design', 'epigenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preclinical study', 'progenitor', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'rotator cuff tear', 'scaffold', 'spatial relationship', 'stem cells', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'tendon development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'translation to humans']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,491199,-0.013059422377110733
"Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort ABSTRACT  Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting the exocrine system, with hallmark symptoms of dry mouth and/or dry eyes caused by the dysfunction of salivary and/or lacrimal glands, respectively. While Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and other studies have increased our knowledge of genetic risk factors for SS, the disease etiology remains not well understood, and such risk factors have not been translatable to any immunological treatment options for SS. The NIH-NIDCR-funded Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) was established to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of patients with SS by developing/validating standardized classification criteria for SS; and developing a rich biospecimen repository with clinical data to be used for future epidemiologic, pathogenesis, and genetic studies of SS.[1, 2] For this project, we will focus on genomic data and measures of the 2016 ACR-EULAR classification criteria, involving ocular, oral, and autoantibody manifestations. As shown in our previous work, the genetics of SS varies with ancestry; thus, we will cluster patients by both the criteria subphenotypes and genetic ancestry. We believe that accounting for disease heterogeneity in this way will enable us to more precisely identify disease pathways and mechanisms. Using previously secured funding, we are completing DNA methylation typing on LSGs in 373 SICCA patients and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on PBMCs of 86 SICCA patients who also have DNA methylation profiling. This data provides a unique opportunity for multi-omics analysis to determine correlates between LSG tissue epigenetics, peripheral blood cell-type distributions and cell-specific gene expression by SS subsets. First, using GWAS data and DNA methylation data from LSG biopsies, we will identify genetic and epigenetic modifications associated with subtypes of SS in SICCA patients. We will then examine the relationships between them by testing for genotype-specific methylation and expression, and utilizing mendelian randomization and causal inference testing to investigate causality between these measures. Second, we will analyze scRNAseq data to identify how cell types, states and cell- specific gene expression correlate with SS subtypes. Finally, we will integrate genetics, epigenetics, and transcriptomics to determine multi-omics profiles associated with SS subtypes. We will jointly model associated features from the genomic data to investigate causal pathways via correlation networks, conditional analysis, and machine learning. We anticipate that SS subtypes will exhibit specific relationships within the multi- omics data and that this will advance our understanding of SS disease processes, leading to better treatment targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal leverages unique NIDCR-funded resources by utilizing existing infrastructure and data with high level expertise to better understand the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome and identify new therapeutic pathways. We propose to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data recently generated on patients of the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) biorepository/registry. We will identify genomic determinants of subtypes of SS derived from subphenotypes and genetic ancestry, which we believe will be more indicative of underlying biologic pathways and will lead to more appropriate genomic candidates for SS treatments.",Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort,10041649,R03DE029800,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'American', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cells', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exanthema', 'Exhibits', 'Exocrine System', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Immunologics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Laboratories', 'Lacrimal gland structure', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'college', 'differential expression', 'disease heterogeneity', 'epigenome', 'eye dryness', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'methylation testing', 'monocyte', 'multiple omics', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2020,161500,0.0038565892430400812
"Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation Abstract Macrophages in Greek means “big eaters"" are powerful cellular components of innate immunity. They play a pivotal role in immune defense by ‘eating’ pathogens, dead or cancerous cells. They also contribute to tissue homeostasis, development and repair. When doing their job, macrophages react to their surroundings and trigger acute inflammation to resolve the problems. They do so by assuming one of the two states that have been widely recognized, i.e., immunoreactive (proinflammatory) and immunotolerant (a.k.a, M1 and M2, respectively). While finite degrees of reactivity and tolerance are desirable in physiology, excess of either state is undesirable and invariably associated with disease pathogenesis (i.e., the Goldilocks conundrum). For example, hyperreactivity is recognized as the root cause of tissue injury in a wide array of diseases (colitis, sepsis, NASH) and hypertolerance is a common determinant that drives most, if not all chronic diseases that are incurable, e.g., cancers. Consensus on the definition of these physiologic and pathologic macrophage states has not been reached, perhaps because of 4 major challenges: heterogeneity, biological robustness, the temporal evolution of the network, and artifacts (tremendous plasticity of macrophages as they drift rapidly when isolated from tissues). We have used a novel computational methodology, Boolean Implication Network [Sahoo 2008], to analyze pooled human macrophage gene expression datasets. This method, which identifies asymmetric gene expression patterns, blurs noise (heterogeneity/artifacts) but reveals a temporal model of events that is invariably seen across all datasets. The analysis revealed hitherto unknown continuum transition states between reactive to tolerant states along five paths; machine-learning identified one of them as the major path which subsequently stood the rigorous test/validation on multiple publicly available transcriptomic datasets, across species (mouse and human), macrophage subtypes and disease states. Most importantly, unlike other commonly used gene cluster signatures, the Boolean path can prognosticate outcomes across diverse diseases. Preliminary validation studies on a genetic model confirm that the path could be exploited for modulating macrophage polarization by altering LPS/TLR4 responses. We will now interrogate the impact of these discoveries using an iterative approach, i.e., model-driven experimentation and experiment-driven model refinement, through three aims: Unravel the importance of novel molecular drivers in the newly identified gene signatures of macrophage polarization using semi-HTP chemical/genetic screens on murine and human monocyte-derived macrophages (Aim 1), in murine disease models of hyperreactivity and hypertolerance (Aim 2) and in “Humanoids”, i.e., human organoid-based microbe/immune cells co-culture models (“gut-in-a-dish”; Aim 3). Although our focus is gastrointestinal infection and inflammation, the findings will define macrophage transition states in multiple organs/disease contexts and therefore, impact many fields. We expect to identify high-value therapeutic targets that can restrict and/or reset macrophage responses to infections and inflammation within the “Goldilocks zone.” Narrative Macrophages are powerful cellular components of innate immunity; on the one hand they play a pivotal role in defending against pathogens, cancerous cells and other harmful stimuli by being immunoreactive, and on the other hand, they contribute to tissue homeostasis by being immunotolerant to harmless antigens and beneficial microbes. Too much or too little of either of these two states (immunoreactive vs. tolerant) can serve as triggers and perpetuate diverse human diseases. Using novel computational approaches, we have charted a formal model for macrophage response to infections, and revealed hitherto unknown important genes that regulate the process of macrophage polarization; we plan to identify potential therapeutic targets that can reprogram macrophage response in disease states.",Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation,10100201,R01AI155696,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cancerous', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Eating', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Immunity', 'Noise', 'Nomenclature', 'Occupations', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TLR4 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'beneficial microorganism', 'body system', 'bone', 'cell type', 'chemical genetics', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gastrointestinal infection', 'genetic signature', 'human disease', 'human model', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,1000214,-0.02497834346795404
"Genetic Modulators of Glaucoma Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor, damage and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) underlies visual field loss. However, a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous and it represents a family of age-related disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic networks. We propose to continue to use the BXD (C57BL/6 x DBA/2J) family of recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice as a genetic reference panel (GRP) and to combine our work with human genome wide association studies (GWAS), to uncover and clarify the genetic heterogeneity that underlies optic nerve (ON) damage. We have had recent success using this combined approach in the regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP). We are very well positioned to take the next step and apply this approach to define cellular targets of RGC damage and death. We propose to uncover phenotypic diversities of glaucoma-related ON damage and uncover common underlying mechanisms that are shared with IOP modulation. Our long-term research goal is to identify disease mechanisms and develop neuroprotective therapies to preserve retinal health in patients at risk for glaucoma. Our overall objective is to identify novel gene products and related mechanisms that lead to glaucomatous endophenotypes using multi-dimensional genetic analyses, cross-species comparisons (mouse, rat and human) and validation using novel murine glaucoma models. Our central hypothesis is that molecular processes leading to glaucoma associated-endophenotypes, such as elevated IOP and ON damage, are shared across species, and that species comparisons can uncover common underlying mechanisms, and efficient testing of targeted glaucoma therapeutics. In the current investigation, we perform a systematic analysis of ON damage, and an additional species—rat. We will mine the extensive databases of IOP and ON damage that we are generating for more than 70 BXD strains across five age cohorts with the goal of defining new models of glaucoma. An overall strength of this proposal is the combination of cutting-edge systems genetics methods, species comparisons of glaucoma phenotypes, and a strong interdisciplinary team that includes investigators with extensive experience in systems genetics, glaucoma, GWAS in human and rats, and advanced computational methods. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following thress studies: 1) Identify the candidate gene on chromosome 12 that modulates ON damage; 2) Determine if modulation of IOP and/or ON damage is shared across rodent species; and 3) Identify novel spontaneous glaucoma models through a comprehensive analysis of our enlarged BXD GRP of 100 or more BXD strains. The outcomes of these studies will define novel genes and molecular networks that underlie glaucoma-associated phenotypes and also provide unique glaucoma models for future analysis. These results are expected to fundamentally advance the field of glaucoma disease mechanisms and enable targeted therapeutic development. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and a thorough understanding of this disease is a major challenge because its genetic basis is heterogeneous, and it likely represents a family of disorders resulting from intersecting gene-regulated pathophysiologic pathways.

"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9962426,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'multiple data types', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,323659,-0.017293260777339236
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,9982627,RM1HG009034,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All of Us Research Program', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'CCL4 gene', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Conceptions', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Protection', 'Data Security', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'European Union', 'Family', 'Film', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Identity', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Privacy', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newspapers', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral economics', 'blockchain', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'data access', 'data privacy', 'data sharing', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genomic data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'legal implication', 'minimal risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'news', 'next generation', 'sex', 'social', 'social media']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2020,1112351,-0.021238500098625022
"Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study - DNA Methylation Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Native Hawaiian women (NatHW) experience substantial health disparities compared to women of other races/ethnicities, evidenced by their short healthy life expectancy and high all-cause and cancer mortality rates. Reasons for NatHW’s health disparities likely involve a combination of causes, including genetic susceptibility, individual and contextual socioeconomic status (SES), obesity and related lifestyle factors, smoking, healthcare access and quality, and the environment. The multifactorial basis of disparities requires an array of information and integrative approaches in research. Herein, we propose to use epigenetic biomarkers, known to reflect and mediate the combined effects of some of the genetic and environmental stressors, to enhance our mechanistic understanding of NatHW’s disparities in key carcinogenic metabolic traits. We will base the study in the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), which is following the largest number of otherwise understudied Native Hawaiians (~7,850 women, ~6,120 men), as well as >201,000 older adults of mainly four other ethnicities (African American, Japanese American, Latino, white) since 1993-1996 with comprehensive characterization. Research to date indicates that there are significant sex and racial/ethnic differences in the human DNA methylome and in DNA methylation age (DNAm-age) acceleration. Thus, to enable an initial study in the MEC of leukocyte DNA methylation as a likely mediator of NatHW’s health disparities, we request a supplement to the MEC grant (U01 CA164973) in response to NOT-OD-20-048. We will analyze the archived leukocyte DNA samples in the Adiposity Phenotype Study (APS), which is a cross-sectional subset of the MEC, using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC bead chips. This will allow us to compare genome-wide methylation patterns and DNAm-age parameters in 140 NatHW and 140 white women, aged 60-77 years at the time of blood collection. We plan to (Aim 1) compare the DNA methylation patterns by constructing a DNA methylation score (DNAm- score) for NatHW vs. white women using penalized logistic regression of ethnicity on methylation at CpGs, adjusted for % Native Hawaiian genetic ancestry. Based on the selected differentially methylated genes, we will infer the biological functions in pathway analysis. We hypothesize that we will discover a DNA methylation signature and accelerated DNAm-age for NatHW vs. white women. We will then (Aim 2) quantify the proportion of the excess metabolic risk in NatHW compared to white women, namely higher insulin, triglycerides, visceral fat, and liver fat, respectively, mediated through the DNA methylome, based on the DNAm-score and DNAm- age. Finally, we will (Aim 3) identify behavioral and environmental determinants of the DNAm-score or DNAm- age among the wealth of data in the MEC-APS (adulthood weight gain, total body fat, lifetime smoking, diet quality, alcohol and meat intake, physical in/activity, sleep hours, and individual and neighborhood SES). This study addresses the goal of the U3 supplement and the MEC U01 grant and may yield important insight into the mechanisms of the disparities in NatHW. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE Native Hawaiian women (NatHW) experience substantial health disparities compared to women of other races/ethnicities. We propose to compare blood epigenetics, the external changes to DNA induced by both genetic and environmental influences, in NatHW and white women. This analysis nested in a large, long-term follow-up study will allow us to understand better which lifestyle and environmental risk factors, to what extent and for which physiologic functions increase the disease-causing metabolic risk in NatHW through epigenetics.",Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study - DNA Methylation Supplement,10091327,U01CA164973,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '21 year old', 'Aborigine', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Archives', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chinese American', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hepatocarcinogenesis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypermethylation', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'Japanese American', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Latino', 'Leukocytes', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Liver', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polynesian', 'Processed Meats', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Strategic Planning', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visceral', 'Visceral fat', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'aged', 'base', 'bead chip', 'carcinogenicity', 'chronic liver disease', 'disadvantaged population', 'environmental stressor', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'genome wide association study', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'human DNA', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'liver function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mortality', 'promoter', 'racial and ethnic', 'random forest', 'response', 'sex', 'trait']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,U01,2020,232505,0.008876887174160214
"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9817679,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2020,229500,0.009553045052530098
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9840897,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'exercise intervention', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual response', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2020,4401725,-0.008047331960925752
"Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation Project Summary/Abstract: With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the breadth and depth of different omics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of individuals in genomic data science. Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices. Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects, such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Project Narrative: Sharing large-scale functional genomics data is critical for scientific discovery, but comes with important privacy concerns related to the possible misuse of such data. This proposal will quantify and manage the rieslkasted to releasing functional genomics datasets, based on integrating inferred genotypes from the raw sequence files, signal tracks, and microbiome mapped sequences. Finally, we will develop file formats, statistical methodologies, and related software for anonymization of functional genomics data that enable open sharing.",Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation,9970939,R01HG010749,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glean', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'open data', 'privacy preservation', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,523409,-0.015241666311093145
"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community. The proposed work will advance the ﬁeld of statistical genomics and facilitate trans-omics precision medicine studies of chronic diseases.

"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,9928091,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Cell Death', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Deacetylation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HDAC7 histone deacetylase', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous body substance', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic platform', 'healthspan', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel strategies', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'programs', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,483750,-0.01806813538460994
"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10032890,R01DK125562,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Base Sequence', 'Beds', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cleft Palate', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Mouse', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intracisternal A-Particle Elements', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Micronutrients', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrotransposon', 'Seminal', 'Supplementation', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'critical period', 'disorder risk', 'early pregnancy', 'embryo culture', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenetic variation', 'experimental study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolic phenotype', 'mother nutrition', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nonhuman primate', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'offspring', 'peripheral blood', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,500075,0.0048898039875918745
"Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores PROJECT SUMMARY The key appeal of polygenic risk scores (PRS) is the provision of individual-level estimates of genetic liability to complex disease. These proxies of genetic liability enable a raft of applications across clinical and basic research settings. However, while PRS are set to play a pivotal role in the future of biomedical research, their present formulation is suboptimal since it fails to directly account for substructure in genetic disease risk. The overarching goal of our proposal is to introduce a new generation of pathway-specific PRS, informed by biological function. Rather a single genome-wide PRS for each individual, they will have a set of k PRS over k pathways. Pathways will be defined according to multiscale integration of ‘omics data, exploiting co-expression networks, the transcriptome and the epigenome. The key deliverable from this project will be the production of a powerful and comprehensive pathway-specific PRS computational tool, PRSet, informed by biological function. The rationale is that PRS calculated for individuals by aggregating the effects of all risk variants genome-wide, results in a loss of vital individual-level information. Providing pathway-specific estimates of genetic liability, computed in a scalable, statistically rigorous way, informed by latest multi-omic data, could enable researchers to better decompose heterogenous complex disease, identify key pathways that explain overlap or differences among disorders, and explain problems of portability of PRS between and within populations. Applying our pathway-specific PRS tool, we seek to stratify patients into more homogenous subgroups by their liability over key pathways. We will use PRSet for stratification in three ways: (i) stratifying within SCZ/BiP, testing if liability over different pathways forms multiple routes to disease, (ii) differentiating between SCZ and BiP, testing if key pathways differentiate these highly overlapping disorders, (iii) testing whether variation in treatment response can be explained by pathway liability. Such stratification could help explain past successes, failures and adverse-effects in clinical trials, and provide new therapeutic targets tailored to subsets of patients. Our proposal is significant because the burgeoning application of PRS means that any advance in the PRS approach will have immediate, high impact across psychiatric research. Pathway-specific PRS could open-up routes to hypotheses that cannot be answered by genome-wide PRS. If PRSet reveals that genetic liability is more stratified than presently modelled, then this would call for a focus on pathways and their multi-omic integration, paving a new path towards precision medicine. Our proposal is innovative because we develop the first pathway-specific, function-informed, PRS tool, we propose that disease risk may be influenced by multiple genetic liabilities, and we stratify patients according to pathway-specific genetic risk for the first time. In conclusion, our proposal delivers a tool for the field to perform powerful pathway PRS analyses, better understand genetic liability to disease, and which may offer a more direct route to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are set to play a key role in advancing our understanding of the etiology and treatment of disease. While the application of genome-wide PRS is burgeoning across biomedical research, we propose that pathway-specific PRS have even greater potential to provide etiological insights and will help pave the way to precision medicine. Here we introduce a new generation of pathway-specific polygenic risk scores, informed by biological function, and deliver a comprehensive computational tool for their analysis, applying it to perform patient stratification in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.","Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores",9947403,R01MH122866,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,545648,-0.013325768939309746
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9989904,U01MH115727,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2020,4125261,-0.00915549599098751
"Privacy-preserving genomic medicine at scale 1 Project Summary  2  3 High-throughput sequencing, biomedical imaging, and electronic health record technologies are 4 generating health-related datasets of unprecedented scale. Integrative analysis of these  5 resources promises to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. Yet, the  6 sensitive nature of these data often requires that they be kept in isolated silos, limiting their 7 usefulness to science. The goal of this project is to develop innovative privacy-preserving  8 algorithms to enable data sharing and drive genomic medicine. Crucially, we will draw upon our  9 past success in secure genome analysis and algorithmic expertise in computational biology to 10 address the imminent need to perform complex integrative analyses securely and at scale. 11 Current privacy-preserving tools are prohibitively too costly to perform the complex 12 calculations required in genomic analysis. We previously leveraged the highly structured nature 13 of biological data and novel optimization strategies to implement efficient pipelines for secure 14 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and drug interaction predictions which scaled to 15 millions of samples. In this project, we will further exploit the unique properties of biomedical data 16 to: (i) develop secure integrative analysis methods for genomic medicine; (ii) develop an easy-to- 17 use programming environment with advanced automated optimizations to facilitate the adoption 18 of privacy-preserving analyses; and (iii) promote the use of our privacy techniques to gain novel 19 biological insights through large-scale collaborative genetic studies of multi-ethnic cohorts. 20 With co-I’s Amarasinghe (MIT) and Cho (Broad Institute), we aim to apply these tools to 21 realize the first multi-institution, multi-national secure genetic studies with our partners at the 22 Swiss Personalized Health Network, UK Biobank, Finnish FinnGen, All of Us, NIH NCBI, Broad 23 and Barcelona Supercomputing Center (Letters of Support). We will also use our privacy- 24 preserving approaches to study genomic origins of polygenic traits for disease as well as 25 neuroimaging and other clinical phenotypes. We will continue to actively integrate our methods 26 into community standards (MPEG-G, GA4GH). 27 Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods and open-source, 28 easy-to-use, production-grade implementations that open the door to secure integration and 29 analysis of massive sets of sensitive genomic and clinical data. With input from our collaborations, 30 we will build these tools and apply them to better understand the molecular causes of human 31 health and its translation to the clinic. Project Narrative Combining genomic and health-related data from millions of patients will empower the development of clinically relevant measures of human health and disease risks. However, this task requires securely sharing sensitive data at an immense scale beyond what existing cryptographic platforms can achieve.

"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9931169,F30CA224687,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Relapse', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor Promoters', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States', 'Variant', 'X Inactivation', 'anticancer research', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'simulation', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,47730,-0.0007927279268122781
"lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data PROJECT SUMMARY The onset of most human disease involves numerous molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway, and treatment contexts. This system is probed by thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, and integrative analysis of these data can generate testable hypotheses identifying causal genetic variants and linking them to network level changes in cells to disease phenotypes. This can enable deeper molecular-level understanding of pathophysiology, paving the way to genome-based precision medicine.  The long term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through integrative analysis of high- throughput biological data in a disease context. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration methods, created algorithms for the prediction of disease genes through context-specific and mechanistic network models and analysis of quantitative genetics data, and made novel insights into important biological processes and diseases. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by building public interactive systems capable of real-time user-driven integration that are popular among experimental biologists.  We now propose to connect these gene-level functional network approaches with the underlying genomic variation by deciphering how genomic variants lead to specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. We propose to develop ab initio sequence-level models capable of predicting biochemical effects of any genomic variant (including rare or never observed) on chromatin state and RNA regulation, then link these effects with gene-level regulatory consequences (including tissue-specific transcription and RNA splicing), and finally put genomic sequence directly into the network context via a statistical approach for detecting genes and network neighborhoods with a significantly elevated mutational burden in disease. Our key deliverable will be a user- friendly, interactive web-based framework enabling systems-level variant impact analysis in a network context and an open source library for computational scientists. In addition to systematic analysis across contexts and diseases, we will collaborate with experimentalists to apply our methods to Alzheimer’s, autism spectrum disorders, chronic kidney disease, immune diseases, and congenital heart defects as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to directly contribute to better understanding of these diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE To pave the way for mechanistic interpretation of disease in the genomic context and eventually, precision medicine, we will develop algorithms for de novo prediction of functional biochemical effects of noncoding variants at the DNA regulation and RNA processing levels and then build frameworks for sequence-based prediction of tissue-specific transcription and post-transcriptional RNA processes (starting with splicing). To facilitate discovery of disease mechanisms, we will develop approaches for analyzing these variant effects in a network context, including those developed in the previous grant period (mechanistic and functional networks) and novel network models that integrate exon usage information or enhancer-gene interactions. In addition to verifying top predictions experimentally in our group or by our collaborators in case study areas of neurodegenerative disease, chronic kidney disease, ASD, and congenital heart disease, we will make our methods available to the broader biomedical community through public, interactive user interfaces and open source libraries.",lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,9902503,R01GM071966,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histones', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunology', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'congenital heart disorder', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,448294,-0.01903798249002152
"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9985737,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer transplantation', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2020,545004,-0.017567352440436532
"Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals ABSTRACT While multidrug-resistance transporters including P-gp and MRP2 are generally studied for their role in exporting drugs and foreign compounds from the cell, our studies indicate that these efflux pumps expressed at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells provide a critical link in communication between sentinel functions of mucosal barriers and the immune system. Understanding how this P-gp/eCB anti-inflammatory arm is regulated will provide crucial insight into how dysfunction may promote intestinal inflammation and help identify potential new therapeutic targets. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the central hypothesis we aim to test is whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to prevent unnecessary inflammation. Our pilot studies indicate that the microbiota does influence P-gp expression and function, providing a unique foundation for further cause-effect studies. No data have previously demonstrated a link between the microbiota and eCBs or any other epithelial lipid signals, and may well provide great insight into a novel system. Bridging this gap could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To begin addressing these questions, in Aim 1 of this application will combine in vitro (including human colonoids) and in vivo murine model systems, as well as use healthy and UC patient stool, to more deeply understand the microbial consortia that collectively maximize P-gp expression and function. Aim 2 is designed to identify the microbial metabolites that drive activation of P-gp expression and eCB secretion to maintain an anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses will be performed to provide new information regarding microbial genes, gene clusters, and their metabolic products implicated in maintaining an anti- inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium through regulation of the P-gp/eCB axis. In Aim 3 we will employ novel computational methods will to uncover the inter-microbial network responses and the ecological structure of a stable community that is able to induce P-gp expression. Collectively, knowledge of the pathways that coordinate the maintenance of the P-gp/eCB axis will require a comprehensive understanding of distinct signals regulating intestinal homeostasis, how multiple signals are integrated in the complex intestinal environment, and pathways that modulate host-microbe interactions. Consequently, this proposal will directly advance novel biological principles with guidance of new therapeutic intervention strategies. Public Health Narrative Regulated recruitment and migration of acute inflammatory cells termed neutrophils (PMN) into the intestine and across the specialized epithelium that lines it is critical for host defense, yet dysregulation of this process is associated with disease. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the goal of this proposal will examine whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to maintain a homeostatic anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Understanding this process could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals,10029718,R01DK125407,"['ABCB1 gene', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Apical', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Colitis', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethanolamines', 'Eubacterium', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Knowledge', 'Lactobacillus', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'P-Glycoprotein', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Submucosa', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Work', 'Xenobiotic Metabolism', 'arm', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'commensal bacteria', 'design', 'efflux pump', 'first responder', 'healing', 'host colonization', 'host-microbe interactions', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innate immune mechanisms', 'insight', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal homeostasis', 'mathematical model', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'normal microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'nuclear factor 1', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'theories', 'transcriptomics']",NIDDK,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,560048,-0.023789875531706483
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium. This work will identify new genetic causes and dissect ciliary defects associated with genetic mutations.",Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome,9988508,R01NS048453,"['Apraxias', 'Ataxia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar malformation', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebrum', 'Cilia', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognitive', 'Congenital cerebellar hypoplasia', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Embryo', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joubert syndrome', 'Kidney', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Molar tooth', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Muscle hypotonia', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Sonication', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Termination of pregnancy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Training', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'WNT Signaling Pathway', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'accurate diagnosis', 'affection', 'base', 'cell type', 'cilium biogenesis', 'cohort', 'consanguineous family', 'disorder subtype', 'early childhood', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'fetal', 'founder mutation', 'gene discovery', 'genetic testing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'loss of function mutation', 'malformation', 'mutant', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'population based', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'screening', 'stem cell biology', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,510012,-0.01272925777007647
"Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) – comprising the endocannabinoids, their G-protein coupled re- ceptors, and their metabolic enzymes – is one of the most important physiological systems involved in estab- lishing and maintaining human health. In some illnesses, ECS dysregulation is an element of disease pathol- ogy whereas in others it is believed to be protective. Thus, there is intense interest in developing pharma- cotherapies that target the ECS to blunt its pathologies or harness its protective effects. One of the main challenges in developing new drugs that target the ECS is the problem of side effects, con- sistent with the nearly ubiquitous expression of this signaling system. Current efforts to increase the functional specificity of ECS drugs include preventing them from crossing the blood brain barrier, and targeting ancillary ECS proteins which modulate principal ECS components without being direct effectors themselves. Until now, discovery of ancillary proteins has proceeded mainly by inference from prior knowledge obtained from isolated cells. This approach can be limiting because knowledge of the underlying genetic and biochemical networks is usually incomplete. Here we propose to develop new high-throughput methodologies to enable the first unbi- ased genetic screens to identify new ECS molecules in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is an omnivorous bacterivore but it learns to prefer some species of bacteria more than others. We recently discovered that one of the worm's endocannabinoids increases the worm’s appetite for favored foods over less favored foods, a phenomenon called hedonic amplification. We propose this system as a genetically tractable model of cannabinoid effects on appetitive behavior, providing an easily screenable phenotype that directly corresponds to a well-known human behavior. The research develops two high-throughput microfluidic systems for quantifying hedonic amplification in C. ele- gans. The systems are then utilized to perform two small-scale genetic screens as a prelude to future large- scale screens. In the first, hedonic amplification will be quantified in strains in which homologs of known mam- malian ECS components have been knocked out; this screen further validates the C. elegans ECS as a mam- malian model. In the second screen, hedonic amplification will be assessed in a select set of wild isolate strains of C. elegans to estimate the heritability of this phenotype. The research is significant because it could ultimately lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to mitigate disease and promote health. Cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms involving endocannabinoids are involved in numerous physiological and psy- chological conditions including nausea, obesity, pain, anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and neu- rodegenerative disease where they can be part of the disease or the body's protective response to it. However, most attempts to harness the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid signaling have been stymied by prob- lematic side effects. The proposed research develops and applies innovative methods to screen for genes en- coding new members of the endocannabinoid signaling system as potential drug targets for treatment of endo- cannabinoid-related diseases, with fewer and milder side effects.",Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans,9966951,R21DA047645,"['Action Potentials', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cells', 'Chemotaxis', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzymes', 'Fire - disasters', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'Mutagenesis', 'Names', 'Nausea', 'Nematoda', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obesity', 'Operating System', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Organ', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'anandamide', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cell type', 'design', 'endocannabinoid signaling', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'feeding', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic strain', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hedonic', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function mutation', 'marijuana use disorder', 'member', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2020,184375,-0.013598651320382753
"Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats Project Summary (Overall)  The purpose of this renewal application is to continue the successful activities of our center, which uses quantitative genetic techniques to study the genetic basis of drug abuse-related behaviors in outbred rats. When our center was initially funded in June 2014, our goal was to develop outbred N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as a platform for genetic studies of behaviors that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. The first four years of funding have allowed us to establish a vibrant community of investigators using HS rats to study drug abuse and other traits, which we refer to as an ecosystem. This ecosystem includes both the investigators who are directly involved in this renewal application and many others who have obtained separate funding, some from NIDA, and some from other sources. The growth of this ecosystem reflects one of the ways that our center has served as national resource. We are proposing three projects that involved phenotyping HS rats for a variety of traits, including intravenous cocaine and nicotine self-administration, response to novelty, social behavior, reaction time, and delay discounting. Two of those projects are continuations from the prior funding period and are designed to increase our sample size from 1,600 to 3,200 rats per phenotype. We present data showing that such an increase produces an exponential increase in the number of significant findings. This approach parallels human genetics studies of SUD, which have also benefited tremendously from larger sample sizes. We will use these data to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a suite of related techniques. In addition, we will measure gene expression in behaviorally naïve rats using RNASeq and use those data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate GWAS and eQTL data in an effort to identify specific genes that influence the behavioral phenotypes. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also study genetic correlations, perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) and explore a novel strategy called polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS), that is intended to allow translation of polygenic signals across species. Project 4 will use a network-based approach to extend our GWAS to account for known biological networks. This proposed renewal also includes a pilot project core to support new directions and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. Finally we propose an administrative core that supports many activities of the center, including educational, career development and public outreach. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genes in a range of psychologically complex behaviors and will provide novel biological insights that may support future efforts at preventing or treating drug abuse. Project Narrative (Overall)  Using powerful genetic, molecular and statistical techniques, we will study the genetic basis of traits that have well-established relevance to drug abuse. We expect that these studies will enhance our understanding of drug abuse and lead to the identification of specific genes and pathways. These discoveries will improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to drug abuse in humans and may identify new opportunities to treat psychiatric disorders including but not limited to addiction.",Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats,9971494,P50DA037844,"['Adolescent', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crime', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Esthesia', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Individual', 'Intravenous', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Network-based', 'Nicotine', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Self Administration', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Reinforcement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'discounting', 'drug abuse related behavior', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'premature', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P50,2020,2985563,-0.013757731554242446
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome,9986790,RC2DK118619,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bile duct carcinoma', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'High Performance Computing', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institution', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Disease', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Network-based', 'Norway', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical database', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'pollutant', 'primary outcome', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,RC2,2020,1547338,-0.005859980471746896
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9933925,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Arginine', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biogenesis', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Carbohydrates', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Citrulline', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Health Professional', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Eye Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitric Oxide Pathway', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Optic Nerve', 'Ornithine', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'case control', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'dietary restriction', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'secondary analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'time interval', 'trait']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,546195,-0.0025453620595034137
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults. The relevance of the project to public health is reflected in the long-term goal, which is to construct a genetic risk profile which can be used by health-care providers and educators to identify individuals genetically at risk for chronic tinnitus.",Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,9824578,R21DC016704,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Audiology', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Hyperacusis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrial Arts', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Otitis Media', 'PTGS1 gene', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Tinnitus', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'college', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hearing impairment', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'relating to nervous system', 'serotonin receptor', 'serotonin transporter', 'sound', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'voltage gated channel', 'young adult']",NIDCD,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,151994,-0.011975850716111949
"Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening PROJECT SUMMARY The guidelines for initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are currently based on two risk factors: attained age and family history of CRC. Using the principles of precision medicine, we will individually tailor CRC screening recommendations based on the enormous knowledge we now have on genetic and non- genetic factors that predict risk for this disease. This strategy will reduce under and over-utilization of CRC screening, because individual risks vary substantially in the population, and over 80% of all CRC cases occur in those without a positive family history. In Aim 1 we will develop predictive models for CRC, based on genetic (~30M common and rare genotyped or imputed genetic variants) and clinico-epidemiologic variables (over 70 harmonized characteristics), derived from over 40,000 colorectal tumor cases and 46,000 controls. We will identify key predictors, and derive efficient personalized risk-prediction models for early detection of more treatable CRCs as well for CRC prevention, through the identification of advanced colorectal adenomas. In Aim 2 we will calibrate and validate these models in two prospective cohorts of >120,000 participants, including 40,000 minority members, diversity representing racially/ethnically and socioeconomically. These two cohorts (Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health and the Women's Health Initiative Minority cohort) contain genome-wide genotype array and comprehensive risk factor data coupled to data on screening and outcome data, allowing us to test the model's ability to predict risk for CRC and advanced colorectal adenoma across a broadly defined community-based population, and to personalize decision on starting age of screening based on individually specific genetic and environmental risk factors. In Aim 3 we will estimate the population benefit of our risk-stratified screening strategy, based on our risk prediction methods, compared with the current screening recommendations. This comparison will employ the well-tested decision model currently used to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force CRC screening guidelines. Accomplishing these three aims, our research has the potential to accelerate the translation of a large amount of genetic and epidemiologic research to patient care by predicting advanced adenoma risk, for cancer prevention, and predicting cancer risk, for early cancer detection. Genetic testing is becoming part of routine care and genetic data will increasingly become part of an individual's medical record. Using genetic and non-genetic risk-factor information in clinical and preventive settings is a critical step towards developing precision medicine. Our models will provide recommendations for individually tailored CRC screening and interventions and, because they are personalized, may also increase adherence, maximize the appropriate use of invasive technologies, and guide important next steps towards public health policy development and clinical translation.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) saves lives, but current recommendations for initiation of CRC screening do not use important information on individual genetic, lifestyle and environmental risks for this disease. Our research, in large CRC consortia will accelerate the translation of several decades of genetic and epidemiologic research on CRC risks, to allow for personalized screening decisions, based on an individual's specific genetic and environmental risk factor distributions. This work will ensure that the most comprehensive information will inform novel precision medicine strategies for CRC.  ",Comprehensive Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction to Inform Personalized Screening,9850545,R01CA206279,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Communities', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'community based participatory research', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'functional genomics', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'member', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction model', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,617785,-0.016977622824497714
