"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user's location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user's location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user's trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings. The proposed research would result in a new smartphone-based wayfinding app that could greatly increase travel independence for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,9934891,R01EY029033,"['Adoption', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cost Measures', 'Destinations', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elevator', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Indoor environment', 'Infrastructure', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Process', 'Research', 'Schools', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'digital', 'interest', 'meetings', 'open source', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'way finding', 'wireless fidelity']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,105337,0.1542102129430356

"SCH: INT: Conversations for Vision: Human-Computer Synergies in Prosthetic Interactions  The project will investigate prosthetic support for people with visual impairment (PVI) that integrates computer vision-based prosthetics with video-mediated human-in-the-loop prosthetics. Computer vision- based (CV) prosthetics construe the fundamental technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of parsing and identifying objects across scales, distances, and orientations. Visual prosthetic applications have been central drivers in the development of computer vision technology through the past 50 years. Video-mediated remote sighted assistance (RSA) prosthetics are more recent, enabled by different technologies, and construe the orienting technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of effective helping interactions. RSA services are commercially available now, and have evoked much excitement in the PVI community. The two approaches, CV and RSA, will be successively integrated through a series of increasingly refined Wizard of Oz simulations, and investigate possible synergies between the two approaches. We will employ a human-centered design approach, identifying a set of key assistive interaction scenarios that represent authentic needs and concerns of PVIs, by leveraging our 6-year relationship working directly with our local chapter of the National Federation of the Blind. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): 23.7 million American adults have vision loss; 1.3 million people in US are legally blind.

"Vision in Natural Tasks Summary/Abstract  In the context of natural behavior, humans make continuous sequences of sensory-motor decisions to satisfy current behavioral goals, and vision must provide the information needed to achieve those goals. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoor environments, taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements in these contexts. Currently we have only limited understanding of the constituent tasks in natural locomotion, or the requisite information, and the proposal attempts to specify these.  in the context of natural gait, the patterns of optic flow are unexpectedly complex, raising questions about its role. The patterns of motion on the retina during locomotion depend critically on both eye and body motion, and these in turn depend on behavioral goals. Our first Aim is therefore to comprehensively describe the statistics of retinal motion patterns in a variety of terrains and task contexts. We will measure binocular eye and body movements while walking in outdoor terrains of varying roughness, crossing a busy intersection, and making coffee. These contexts will induce different gaze patterns. We will provide a comprehensive description of the motion stimulus in natural locomotion and help separate out self-motion signals from externally generated motion. These data will allow a more precise specification of the response patterns in cortical motion sensitive areas. Because of the complexity of natural motion patterns, we will re-examine the influence of optic flow on walking direction in a virtual reality environment and test alternative explanations for the role of flow.  A central task in walking is foot placement, and we will focus on identifying the image properties that make a good foothold. Stereo, structure from motion, and spatial image structure are all likely contenders. We directly investigate the role of stereo in foothold selection by examining gait patterns in stereo-deficient subjects in terrains with varying degrees of roughness. Using a different strategy, we will attempt to predict gaze locations and footholds in rough terrain using convolution neural nets (CNN’s) to identify potential search templates for footholds in rough terrain. We will describe fixation patterns from crosswalk and sidewalk navigation and attempt to make inferences about their purpose, and use Modular Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MIRL) to predict direction decisions and decompose the behavior into sub-tasks.  The collection of integrated gaze, body kinematics, and scene images in a range of natural environments is innovative, as little comparable data exists The work will be strengthened by the investigation of stereo- deficient subjects for whom there is almost no integrated eye and body data. Since much of the work in robotics has no visual input at all this should help in development of visual guidance for robots and also help better define the necessary information for individuals with impaired vision. The data set will be made publicly available. Project Narrative  The central goal of this work is to understand vision in its natural context. This is very important information in order to devise suitable vision aids and rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual impairments, and it is becoming increasingly accessible because of developments in technology for monitoring eye and body movements.

"Personalizing Glaucoma Diagnosis by Disease Specific Patterns and Individual Eye Anatomy Project Summary/Abstract Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve which is accompanied by visual ﬁeld (VF) loss. While accurate VF loss diagnosis and the detection of its progression over time is of high relevance to clinical practitioners as it indicates the initiation of or change in ocular therapy, there is no consensus on objective measures for this purpose, and VF measurements are known to be often unreliable. The main objective of this project is to develop clinically applicable measures to improve the diagnosis of glaucomatous VF loss and of its progression by two approaches: First, the identiﬁcation of representative loss patterns and their progression, achieved by large-scale, customized bioinformatical procedures applied to data from glaucoma patients from nine clinical centers and second, the inclusion of eye and patient speciﬁc personalized parameters. In total, 480,486 VFs, are available for this project. One major aim is to develop novel diagnostic indices based on computationally identiﬁed evolution patterns of VF loss, particularly (1) an index that denotes the probability of glaucomatous vision loss and (2) an index that assigns probabilities to a VF that follow-up measurements will be in a certain defect class. The indices will be statistically evaluated on separate VF samples and compared to existing approaches. Routinely available patient speciﬁc parameters which are candidates to impact glaucomatous vision loss are patient ethnicity, type of glaucoma, spherical equivalent (SE) of refractive error and the location of the blind spot relative to ﬁxation. The effect of these parameters on the vision loss patterns will be systematically studied. The impact of their inclusion in the novel diagnostic indices and their potential improvement on glaucoma diagnosis will be quantiﬁed on a separate data set. A further aim is the calculation of a spatial map speciﬁc to a measured VF that represents the preferred VF locations of future defects as well as their reliability as an aid to event-based progression diagnosis. A second major objective is the investigation of the relationship of VF loss and individual parameters related to retinal structure, based on retinal nerve ﬁber layer thickness (RNFLT) measurements around the optic disc. The inter-relationship of representative patterns of RNFLT and its decrease over time with trajectories of major retinal arteries, SE, and blind spot location is systematically studied, and the impact on patterns of VF loss is quantitatively analyzed with the goal to improve the interpretation of existing VF loss and to predict future glaucomatous vision loss. Main contributions of the project with relevance to clinical practice are publicly available open-source software implementations of new diagnostic indices and maps, enhanced by individual functional and structural parameters, and a detailed and personalized model for the relationship between retinal structure and glaucomatous vision loss. Project Narrative Glaucoma is an ocular disease accompanied by vision loss which may progress over time up to total blindness, but the assessment of glaucomatous vision loss is noisy, and it is often hard for clinical practitioners to decide whether changes over time reﬂect true changes of functional vision or are the result of normal measurement variations or artifacts. This project contributes directly and immediately to public health by exploring the impact of individual anatomical parameters on the spatial patterns of glaucomatous vision loss in order to improve the diagnosis of vision loss and of its progression. Main objective of the project is the development of new quantitative diagnostic indices, implemented as publicly available software.",Personalizing Glaucoma Diagnosis by Disease Specific Patterns and Individual Eye Anatomy,9802123,R01EY030575,"['Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Axon', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blindness', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Refractive Errors', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Defect', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Retinal blind spot', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'base', 'central retinal artery', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'fovea centralis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'optic nerve disorder', 'outcome forecast', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sample fixation', 'sex']",NEI,SCHEPENS EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,534037,0.053482074549891324
"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9653180,R01EY025332,"['3-Dimensional', 'Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,416574,0.13423385482180294
"Annual meeting of the Vision Sciences Society: Travel grants for junior investigators PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Vision Sciences Society is a nonprofit membership organization of nearly 2000 scientists interested in the functional aspects of vision. VSS was founded in 2001 with the purpose of bringing together scientists from a broad range of disciplines including visual psychophysics, visual neuroscience, computational vision and visual cognition. The scientific content of the meetings reflects the breadth of topics and interconnected ideas and approaches in modern vision science, from visual coding to perception, recognition and the visual control of action, as well as recent developments in cognitive psychology, computer vision and neuroimaging. Since its founding, VSS has provided a forum and framework for communicating advances in vision science, and VSS has become a flagship conference for the field. The interdisciplinary nature of VSS is reflected in the deliberately diverse membership of the Board of Directors and Abstract Review Committee, and by its formal relationship with the more clinically-oriented Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. Many of the faculty from institutions in the United States who attend VSS are principal investigators of National Eye Institute grants; hence, the research objectives of the programs of the National Institutes of Health and of the National Eye Institute are well-represented in the program planning and individual presentations. Over 60% of participants are predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. Of these 55% are US citizens. VSS provides multiple career development opportunities: (1) the platform and poster presentations provide a forum for trainees to showcase their work and receive feedback, (2) career-development workshops cover topics such as “Getting that Faculty Job”, “Reviewing and Responding to Reviews”, “The Public Face of your Science”, “Careers in Industry and Government”, “Faculty Careers at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions”, and include panel discussions with journal editors, NIH and NSF grant officers, and academic and industry representatives, (3) a “Meet the Professors” event in which trainees meet in small groups with members of the VSS Board and other professors for free-wheeling, open-ended discussions, and (4), a partnership with ARVO through which trainees from one society can carry out research or attend the meeting of the other. Informally, VSS provides opportunities for networking with peers and senior colleagues in a comfortable and engaging setting. The large contingent of early-stage investigators at VSS is a sign of the strong health of the field and the opportunity VSS provides for advancing the field. Our goal is to facilitate access and participation for this next generation of vision scientists. The purpose of this grant is to provide 35 travel awards (5 for ARVO affiliates) for early-career investigators to attend the 2019 meeting, with the focus on attracting and supporting a diverse pool of pre- doctoral students, postdoctoral trainees, and pre-tenure faculty who demonstrate potential for future success as vision researchers and whose research findings will be presented at the meeting. Funds are also requested to support childcare services for awardees and workshops and social events for all early-career participants. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Vision Science Society (VSS) organizes an annual meeting for presenting cutting edge research on the mechanisms and principles of normal and abnormal visual perception. The aging American population will experience an increasing rate of visual loss due to diseases and disorders of the eye and central visual pathway.

"Environmental Localization Mapping and Guidance for Visual Prosthesis Users Project Summary About 1.3 million Americans aged 40 and older are legally blind, a majority because of diseases with onset later in life, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Second Sight has developed the world's first FDA approved retinal implant, Argus II, intended to restore some functional vision for people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In this era of smart devices, generic navigation technology, such as GPS mapping apps for smartphones, can provide directions to help guide a blind user from point A to point B. However, these navigational aids do little to enable blind users to form an egocentric understanding of the surroundings, are not suited to navigation indoors, and do nothing to assist in avoiding obstacles to mobility. The Argus II, on the other hand, provides blind users with a limited visual representation of their surroundings that improves users' ability to orient themselves and traverse obstacles, yet lacks features for high-level navigation and semantic interpretation of the surroundings. The proposed research aims to address these limitations of the Argus II through a synergy of state-of-the-art stimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object recognition technologies. For the past three years, JHU/APL has collaborated with Second Sight to develop similar advanced vision-based capabilities for the Argus II, including capabilities for object recognition and obstacle detection by stereo vision. This proposal is driven by the hypothesis that navigation for users of retinal prosthetics can be greatly improved by incorporating SLAM and object recognition technology conveying environmental information via a retinal prosthesis and auditory feedback. SLAM enables the visual prosthesis system to construct a map of the user's environment and locate the user within that map. The system then provides object location and navigational cues via appropriate sensory modalities enabling the user to mentally form an egocentric map of the environment. We propose to develop and test a visual prosthesis system which 1) constructs a map of unfamiliar environments and localizes the user using SLAM technology 2) automatically identifies navigationally-relevant objects and landmarks using object recognition and 3) provides sensory feedback for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and object/landmark identification. Project Narrative The proposed system, when realized, will use advanced simultaneous localization and mapping, and object recognition techniques, to enable visual prosthesis users with unprecedented abilities to autonomously navigate and identify objects/landmarks in unfamiliar environments.",Environmental Localization Mapping and Guidance for Visual Prosthesis Users,9818350,R01EY029741,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical Device', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Ocular Prosthesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Retinitis Pigmentosa', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Volition', 'aged', 'auditory feedback', 'base', 'behavior test', 'blind', 'cognitive load', 'falls', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'legally blind', 'navigation aid', 'object recognition', 'portability', 'prosthesis wearer', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'retina implantation', 'retinal prosthesis', 'sensory feedback', 'smartphone Application', 'synergism', 'visual feedback', 'visual information']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,641060,0.023295655628459883
"Naturalistic Data Collection In The SmartPlayroom PROJECT SUMMARY The aims of this proposal are to fully develop and validate the SmartPlayroom as a powerful automated data collection and analysis tool in developmental research. This room looks like any playroom in a home or school but is designed to naturalistically collect data in real time and simultaneously on all aspects of children's behavior. Behaviors include movement kinematics, language, eye movements, and social interaction while a child performs naturalistic tasks, plays and explores without instruction, walks or crawls, and interacts with a caregiver. The space is equipped with mobile eye tracking, wireless physiological heart rate and galvanic skin response sensors, audio and video recording, and depth sensor technologies. Funding is requested to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement using an example from visual attention research (Aim 1), and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use in 4-9 year-old children (Aim 2). By combining fine-grained sensor data with high-throughput automated computer vision and machine learning tools, we will be able to automate quantitative data collection and analysis in the SmartPlayroom for use in addressing myriad developmental questions. The SmartPlayroom approach overcomes completely the limitations of task-based experimentation in developmental research, offering quantitative precision in the collection of ecologically valid data. It has the power to magnify both construct validity and measurement reliability in developmental research. The investigators are committed to making freely available our data, computer vision algorithms, and discoveries so that we might move the field forward quickly. NARRATIVE We focus this work on developing and validating a novel and innovative data collection space called the SmartPlayroom, designed to pair naturalistic exploration and action with the precision of computerized automated data collection and analysis. This proposal aims to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement, and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use with 4-9 year-old children in the SmartPlayroom. !",Naturalistic Data Collection In The SmartPlayroom,9507909,R21MH113870,"['9 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automated Annotation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Instruction', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schools', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'eye hand coordination', 'flexibility', 'frontier', 'grasp', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'research and development', 'sample fixation', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'tool']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,203125,0.06757369970764401
"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user’s location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user’s location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user’s trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings. The proposed research would result in a new smartphone-based wayfinding app that could greatly increase travel independence for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,9499823,R01EY029033,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cost Measures', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elevator', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Indoor environment', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Needs Assessment', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Schools', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'interest', 'lens', 'meetings', 'open source', 'radiofrequency', 'sensor', 'way finding', 'wireless fidelity']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,416374,0.1542102129430356
"A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device ABSTRACT This project will create the first objective measurement tool, the VisBox, for the vision subtype of concussion (VSC). This will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye-care professional, for referral to a vision specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendations. The persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties. A lack of accessible, objective vision diagnostics are critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatment. The VisBox will be a software product that is used with the OcuTracker, Oculogica’s proprietary eye-tracking hardware platform. The VisBox will input eye movement measurements from the OcuTracker, calculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve function affected during a concussion, and use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this study. The VisBox will be used by non- vision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussion: convergence insufficiency (CI), accommodative insufficiency (AI), and saccadic dysfunction (SD) in under 4 minutes, during the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosed. The long-term goal is to develop an objective assessment of vision characteristics, that will enable physicians that are non-specialists in vision to 1) screen for concussion-related vision disorders; 2) identify VSC; 3) make decisions about the necessity of a referral for a comprehensive vision examination; 4) monitor the effectiveness of vision treatment. Phase I Hypothesis. VisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBI- related vision disorder, i.e., VSC, by leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking system. Specific Aim I. Generate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI-related vision disorder in 250 pediatric concussion patients. Specific Aim II. Develop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CI, AI, and SD using OcuTracker data. Plans for Phase II. The VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective randomized clinical study. Phase II will be a multi-armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive to vision therapy. Commercial Opportunity. VisBox customers are non-eye care specialists including neurologists, pediatricians, emergency room physicians, sports medicine physicians, and concussion specialists. The total addressable market is $400M, assuming 4M annual scans at $100/scan needed for concussions in the US. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT At least 4 million concussions occur in the US each year, and up to 30% of these injuries persist beyond 4 weeks in a condition known as persistent post-concussion symptoms, which is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, with children particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties – with often serious consequences. The lack of an accessible, objective vision diagnostics presents a critical barrier to identification of the vision disorder concussion sub-type (VSC) and referral for treatment. The proposed technology will be the first objective tool that can be used by non-vision-specialists to identify concussion-related vision symptoms that is accessible to a broad range of facilities and will enable non-specialist physicians the ability to refer patients to concussion specialists to improve outcomes, decrease the time it takes patients to return to work or play, and reduce healthcare costs associated with this debilitating condition.",A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device,9465330,R41NS103698,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Brain Concussion', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Post-Concussion Syndrome', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vision', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visit', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'chronic pain', 'commercial application', 'concussive symptom', 'disabling symptom', 'disorder subtype', 'economic impact', 'handheld equipment', 'improved outcome', 'lens', 'novel', 'patient response', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,"OCULOGICA, INC.",R41,2018,503162,0.12230919140649439

"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9438535,R01EY025332,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,416574,0.13423385482180294
"Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision Abstract Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  Difficulty in accessing print imposes obstacles to education, employment, social interaction and recreation.  The ongoing transition to the production and distribution of digital documents brings about new opportunities for people with visual impairment.  Digital documents on computers and mobile devices permit easy manipulation of print size, contrast polarity, font, page layout and other attributes of text.  In short, we now hae unprecedented opportunities to adapt text format to meet the needs of visually impaired readers.  In recent years, our laboratory and others in the vision-science community have made major strides in understanding the impact of different forms of low vision on reading, and the dependence of reading performance on key text properties such as character size and contrast.  But innovations in reading technology have outstripped our knowledge about low-vision reading.  A major gap still exists in translating these laboratory findings into methods for customizing text displays for people with low vision.  The broad aim of the current proposal is to apply our knowledge about the impact of vision impairment on reading to provide tools and methods for enhancing reading accessibility in the modern world of digital reading technology.  Our research plan has three specific goals:   1) To develop and validate an electronic version of the MNREAD test of reading vision, to extend this technology to important text variables in addition to print size, and to develop methods for customizing the selection of text properties for low-vision readers.  MNREAD is the most widely used test of reading in vision research and was originally developed in our laboratory with NIH support.  2) To investigate the ecology of low-vision reading in order to better understand how modern technologies, such as iPad and Kindle are being used by people with low vision.  We plan to evaluate the feasibility of using internet methods to survey low-vision individuals concerning their reading behavior and goals, and of collecting approximate measures of visual function over the internet.  We also plan to develop an ""accessibility checker"" to help low-vision computer users and their families to evaluate the accessibility of specific text displays.  3) To enhance reading accessibility by developing methods for enlarging the visual span (the number of adjacent letters that can be recognized without moving the eyes).  A reduced visual span is thought to be a major factor limiting reading in low vision, especially for people with central-field loss from macular degeneration.  We have already demonstrated methods for enlarging the visual span in peripheral vision.  We plan to develop a more effective perceptual training method for enlarging the visual span, with the goal of improving reading performance for people with central-vision loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  The ongoing transition to the use of digital documents on computers and mobile devices brings about new opportunities for customizing text for people with visual impairment.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.  Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions.  We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area).  This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement.  Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives:  ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals:  1) Empirical:  determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces.  2) Computational:  develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces.  3) Deployment:  translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility.  The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions:  University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare.  This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare).  We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.

"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user. The project addresses the need of approximately 1 % of our world's population, including millions of Americans, who rely on wheelchair for mobility.",NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair,9133939,R01NR015371,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conscious', 'Detection', 'Disabled Persons', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Hand functions', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Subconscious', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual Motion', 'Wheelchairs', 'aging population', 'base', 'improved', 'operation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'robot control', 'sensor']",NINR,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,133916,0.13433017781940323
"Naturalistic Data Collection In The SmartPlayroom PROJECT SUMMARY The aims of this proposal are to fully develop and validate the SmartPlayroom as a powerful automated data collection and analysis tool in developmental research. This room looks like any playroom in a home or school but is designed to naturalistically collect data in real time and simultaneously on all aspects of children's behavior. Behaviors include movement kinematics, language, eye movements, and social interaction while a child performs naturalistic tasks, plays and explores without instruction, walks or crawls, and interacts with a caregiver. The space is equipped with mobile eye tracking, wireless physiological heart rate and galvanic skin response sensors, audio and video recording, and depth sensor technologies. Funding is requested to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement using an example from visual attention research (Aim 1), and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use in 4-9 year-old children (Aim 2). By combining fine-grained sensor data with high-throughput automated computer vision and machine learning tools, we will be able to automate quantitative data collection and analysis in the SmartPlayroom for use in addressing myriad developmental questions. The SmartPlayroom approach overcomes completely the limitations of task-based experimentation in developmental research, offering quantitative precision in the collection of ecologically valid data. It has the power to magnify both construct validity and measurement reliability in developmental research. The investigators are committed to making freely available our data, computer vision algorithms, and discoveries so that we might move the field forward quickly. NARRATIVE We focus this work on developing and validating a novel and innovative data collection space called the SmartPlayroom, designed to pair naturalistic exploration and action with the precision of computerized automated data collection and analysis. This proposal aims to demonstrate the scientific advantage of naturalistic measurement, and in the process, to provide data to further develop flexible computer vision algorithms for automated behavioral analysis for use with 4-9 year-old children in the SmartPlayroom. !",Naturalistic Data Collection In The SmartPlayroom,9373088,R21MH113870,"['9 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automated Annotation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Instruction', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schools', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive development', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'eye hand coordination', 'flexibility', 'frontier', 'grasp', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'research and development', 'sample fixation', 'sensor', 'skills', 'tool']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,243750,0.06757369970764401
"Capti Screen Reading Assistant for Goal Directed Web Browsing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Web browsing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and magnifiers can often be a frustrating and challenging experience for people with vision impairments, because it entails a lot of searching for content, forms, and links that are required for doing online tasks such as shopping, bill-payment, reservations, etc. This SBIR Phase II project will build on Phase I results and will continue the development and eventual deployment of Capti Screen Reading Assistant - a next-generation assistive technology, enabling goal- directed web browsing for people with visual impairments. With Capti Assistant, users will be able to stay focused on their high-level browsing goals that are expressed in natural language (spoken or typed). The Assistant will lead the users step-by-step towards the fulfillment of these goals by offering suggestions on what action to take at every step of the way and automatically executing the chosen action on behalf of the user. Suggested actions will include operations such as form filling, activating controls (e.g., clicking buttons and links), et. Capti Assistant will dramatically reduce the time spent by people with visual impairments on performing tasks online. The Assistant will significantly improve the speed and efficiency with which they can interact with the Web, thereby, making people with disabilities more productive in today's web-based economy. Given a user browsing goal, expressed in a natural-language form, Capti Assistant will utilize a predictive model to guide the user toward the goal. The unique aspect of the Assistant is that its suggestions will be automatically learned from the user's own history of browsing actions and commands, as well as from the user's demonstration of how to accomplish browsing tasks that have not been done before. The Assistant will process user commands and present the suggested browsing actions to the user on demand, giving the user a choice between following the suggestions or continue browsing normally without accepting the suggestions. The functionality offered by the Assistant will go far beyond popular personal assistant applications such as Siri, which have not been designed specifically for people with vision impairments, and which cannot be used for ad hocweb browsing. Capti Assistant will go a long way towards bridging the growing web accessibility divide between the ways people with and without vision impairments browse the Web. For them, the Assistant will usher in a new era of independence and employability in our global web-based economy.

"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9238777,R01EY025332,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,416574,0.13423385482180294
"Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychophysics of Reading - Normal and Low Vision Abstract Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.  Difficulty in accessing print imposes obstacles to education, employment, social interaction and recreation.  The ongoing transition to the production and distribution of digital documents brings about new opportunities for people with visual impairment.  Digital documents on computers and mobile devices permit easy manipulation of print size, contrast polarity, font, page layout and other attributes of text.  In short, we now hae unprecedented opportunities to adapt text format to meet the needs of visually impaired readers.  In recent years, our laboratory and others in the vision-science community have made major strides in understanding the impact of different forms of low vision on reading, and the dependence of reading performance on key text properties such as character size and contrast.  But innovations in reading technology have outstripped our knowledge about low-vision reading.  A major gap still exists in translating these laboratory findings into methods for customizing text displays for people with low vision.  The broad aim of the current proposal is to apply our knowledge about the impact of vision impairment on reading to provide tools and methods for enhancing reading accessibility in the modern world of digital reading technology.  Our research plan has three specific goals:   1) To develop and validate an electronic version of the MNREAD test of reading vision, to extend this technology to important text variables in addition to print size, and to develop methods for customizing the selection of text properties for low-vision readers.  MNREAD is the most widely used test of reading in vision research and was originally developed in our laboratory with NIH support.  2) To investigate the ecology of low-vision reading in order to better understand how modern technologies, such as iPad and Kindle are being used by people with low vision.  We plan to evaluate the feasibility of using internet methods to survey low-vision individuals concerning their reading behavior and goals, and of collecting approximate measures of visual function over the internet.  We also plan to develop an ""accessibility checker"" to help low-vision computer users and their families to evaluate the accessibility of specific text displays.  3) To enhance reading accessibility by developing methods for enlarging the visual span (the number of adjacent letters that can be recognized without moving the eyes).  A reduced visual span is thought to be a major factor limiting reading in low vision, especially for people with central-field loss from macular degeneration.  We have already demonstrated methods for enlarging the visual span in peripheral vision.  We plan to develop a more effective perceptual training method for enlarging the visual span, with the goal of improving reading performance for people with central-vision loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Reading difficulty is one of the most disabling consequences of vision loss for five million Americans with low vision.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.  Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions.  We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area).  This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement.  Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives:  ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals:  1) Empirical:  determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces.  2) Computational:  develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces.  3) Deployment:  translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility.  The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions:  University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare.  This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare).  We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice.

"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids. The PI's team has performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the methods' near term applications will impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the methods will improve the autonomy of small robots and portable robotic devices that have a myriad of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the Pi's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"NRI: A Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid for the Visually Impaired PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The objective of the proposed research is to develop new technology for a Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid (W-ROMA) for the visually impaired. The W-ROMA is a hand-worn assistive device that provides assistance to a visually impaired individual in effectively grasping an object. Thanks to the onboard computer vision methods, the W-ROMA is capable of detecting a target object, determining the hand-object misalignment, and conveying to the wearer, via natural human-device interfaces, the desired hand motion for hand-object alignment. The W-ROMA will contribute to the independent lives of the visually impaired in twofold: First, it helps the visually impaired with independent travel by enabling them to identify a movable obstacle and manipulate the obstacle to make a passage. Second, it assists the visually impaired in effectively grasping an object for non-navigational purpose. The PIs will involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project and use the proposed project activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision and human-robot interaction methods that support accurate and effective object grasping for the visually impaired for their independent daily lives. These methods include: (1) a new real-time object recognition method; (2) an innovative hand-object alignment mechanism; (3) a novel hybrid tactile display system for object shape rendering; and (4) a computationally efficient device localization method. The proposed solutions can be encapsulated in a hand-worn robotic device. The W-ROMA will provide new co-robotic functions for the visually impaired. The PIs have performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision and tactile display methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the research will positively impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the proposed methods can be applied to other small robotic systems that have a wide range of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the PI's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.                ",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9030162,R01EY025332,"['3D Print', 'Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2016,416574,0.13423385482180294
"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision.  We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, o perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment.  Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions.  We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area).  This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement.  Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives:  ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals:  1) Empirical:  determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces.  2) Computational:  develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces.  3) Deployment:  translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility.  The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions:  University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare.  This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare).  We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice.

"NRI: An Egocentric Computer Vision based Active Learning Co-Robot Wheelchair DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of this proposal is to conduct research on the foundational models and algorithms in computer vision and machine learning for an egocentric vision based active learning co-robot wheelchair system to improve the quality of life of elders and disabled who have limited hand functionality or no hand functionality at all, and rely on wheelchairs for mobility. In this co-robt system, the wheelchair users wear a pair of egocentric camera glasses, i.e., the camera is capturing the users' field-of-the-views. This project help reduce the patients' reliance on care-givers. It fits NINR's mission in addressing key issues raised by the Nation's aging population and shortages of healthcare workforces, and in supporting patient-focused research that encourage and enable individuals to become guardians of their own well-beings.  The egocentric camera serves two purposes. On one hand, from vision based motion sensing, the system can capture unique head motion patterns of the users to control the robot wheelchair in a noninvasive way. Secondly, it serves as a unique environment aware vision sensor for the co-robot system as the user will naturally respond to the surroundings by turning their focus of attention, either consciously or subconsciously. Based on the inputs from the egocentric vision sensor and other on-board robotic sensors, an online learning reservoir computing network is exploited, which not only enables the robotic wheelchair system to actively solicit controls from the users when uncertainty is too high for autonomous operation, but also facilitates the robotic wheelchair system to learn from the solicited user controls. This way, the closed- loop co-robot wheelchair system will evolve and be more capable of handling more complicated environment overtime.  The aims ofthe project include: 1) develop an method to harness egocentric computer vision-based sensing of head movements as an alternative method for wheelchair control; 2) develop a method leveraging visual motion from the egocentric camera for category independent moving obstacle detection; and 3) close the loop of the active learning co-robot wheelchair system through uncertainty based active online learning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The project will improve the quality of life of those elders and disabled who rely on wheelchairs for mobility, and reduce their reliance on care-givers. It builds an intelligent wheelchair robot system that can adapt itself to the personalized behavior of the user.

"NRI: Small: A Co-Robotic Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The project's objective is to develop enabling technology for a co-robotic navigation aid, called a Co-Robotic Cane (CRC), for the visually impaired. The CRC is able to collaborate with its user via intuitive Human-Device Interaction (HDl) mechanisms for effective navigation in 3D environments. The CRCs navigational functions include device position estimation, wayfinding, obstacle detection/avoidance, and object recognition. The use of the CRC will improve the visually impaired's independent mobility and thus their quality of life. The proposal's educational plan is to involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project, and use the project's activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision methods that support accurate blind navigation in 3D environments and intuitive HDl interfaces for effective use of device. These methods include: (1) a new robotic pose estimation method that provides accurate device pose by integrating egomotion estimation and visual feature tracking; (2) a pattern recognition method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model that may recognize indoor structures and objects for wayfinding and obstacle manipulation/ avoidance; (3) an innovative mechanism for intuitive conveying of the desired travel direction; and (4) a human intent detection interface for automatic device mode switching. The GPU implementation of the computer vision methods will make real-time execution possible. The proposed blind navigation solution will endow the CRC with advanced navigational functions that are currently unavailable in the existing blind navigation aids. The PI's team has performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the methods' near term applications will impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the methods will improve the autonomy of small robots and portable robotic devices that have a myriad of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the Pi's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"NRI: A Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid for the Visually Impaired PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The objective of the proposed research is to develop new technology for a Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid (W-ROMA) for the visually impaired. The W-ROMA is a hand-worn assistive device that provides assistance to a visually impaired individual in effectively grasping an object. Thanks to the onboard computer vision methods, the W-ROMA is capable of detecting a target object, determining the hand-object misalignment, and conveying to the wearer, via natural human-device interfaces, the desired hand motion for hand-object alignment. The W-ROMA will contribute to the independent lives of the visually impaired in twofold: First, it helps the visually impaired with independent travel by enabling them to identify a movable obstacle and manipulate the obstacle to make a passage. Second, it assists the visually impaired in effectively grasping an object for non-navigational purpose. The PIs will involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project and use the proposed project activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision and human-robot interaction methods that support accurate and effective object grasping for the visually impaired for their independent daily lives. These methods include: (1) a new real-time object recognition method; (2) an innovative hand-object alignment mechanism; (3) a novel hybrid tactile display system for object shape rendering; and (4) a computationally efficient device localization method. The proposed solutions can be encapsulated in a hand-worn robotic device. The W-ROMA will provide new co-robotic functions for the visually impaired. The PIs have performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision and tactile display methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the research will positively impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the proposed methods can be applied to other small robotic systems that have a wide range of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the PI's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering.

"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays.  This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment.  No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents.  Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image.  For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast.  These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view.  Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users.  Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures.  The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.  The proposed research would result in a smartphone/tablet-based assistive technology system (available for free) to provide increased access to such display information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users,8916115,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blindness', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Location', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'information display', 'interest', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'prototype']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2015,368560,0.14982196787593527

"Video-based Speech Enhancement for Vision and Hearing Impairment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Video-based Speech Enhancement for Persons with Hearing and Vision Loss Project Summary It is estimated that by 2030, the number of people in the United States over the age of 65 will account for over 20% of the total population.  Hearing and vision loss naturally accompanies the aging process.  Persons with hearing loss can benefit from observing the visual cues from a speaker such as the shape of the lips and facial expression to greatly improve their ability to comprehend speech.  However, persons with vision loss cannot make use of these visual cues, and have a harder time understanding speech, especially in noisy environments.  Furthermore, people with normal vision can use visual information to identify a speaker in a group, which allows them to focus on this person.  This can greatly benefit a person with hearing loss who may be using a device such as a sound amplifier or a hearing aid.  A user with vision loss, however, needs to be provided with this speaker information to make optimal use of such devices.  We propose developing a prototype device that will clean the speech signal from a target speaker and improve speech comprehension for persons with hearing and vision loss in everyday situations.  In order to accomplish this task, we need to harness the visual cues that have so far largely been ignored in the design of assistive technolo- gies for persons with hearing loss.  Our first aim is to learn speaker-independent visual cues that are associated with the target speech signal, and use these audio-visual cues to design speech enhancement algorithms that perform much better in noisy everyday environment than current methods which only utilize the audio signal.  We will utilize a video camera and computer vision methods to design advanced digital signal processing techniques to enhance the target speech signals recorded through a microphone.  Our second aim is to use the video and audio signals to detect and efficiently localize the visible speaker.  The information regarding the location of the speaker of interest can then be used to efficiently perform speaker separation, as well as be provided to the user.  Finally, we aim to implement these developed algorithms on a portable prototype system.  We will test the performance of this system and improve the user-interface through user experiments in real-world situations as well as laboratory conditions.  The end product will show the feasibility and importance of incorporating multiple modalities into sensory assistive devices, and set the stage for future research and development efforts.

"Sign Finding and Reading SFAR on GPU Accelerated Mobile Devices     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inability to access information on printed signs directly impacts the mobility independence of the over 1.2 million blind persons in the U.S. Many previously proposed technological solutions to this problem either required physical modifications to the environment (talking signs or the placement of coded markers) or required the user to carry around specialized computational equipment, which can be stigmatizing. A recently pursued strategy is to utilize the computational capabilities of smart phones and techniques from computer vision to allow blind persons to read signs at a distance using commercially available, non-stigmatizing, smart- phones. However, despite the fact that sophisticated algorithms exist to recognize and extract sign text from cluttered video input (as evidenced, for example, by mapping services such as Google Maps automatically locating and blurring out only license plate text in street-view maps) current mobile solutions for reading sign text at a distance perform relatively poorly. This poor performance is largely because until recently, smart-phone processors have simply not been able to execute state-of-the-art computer vision text extraction and recognition algorithms at real-time rates, which forced previous mobile sign readers to utilize older, simplistic, less effective algorithms. Next-generation smart-phones run on fundamentally different, hybrid processor architectures (such as the Tegra 4, Snapdragon 800, both released in 2013) with dedicated embedded graphical processing units (GPUs) and multi-core CPUs, which make them ideal for high-performance, vision-heavy computation. In this study, we propose to develop a smart-phone-based system for finding and reading signs at a distance which significantly outperforms previous such readers by implementing state-of-the-art text extraction algorithms on modern smart-phone hybrid GPU/CPU processor architectures. In Phase I, the proposed system will be developed and tested with blind users. In Phase II, feedback from user testing will be integrated into system design and the performance will be improved to permit operation in extremely challenging (such as low light) environments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 1.2 million people in the US are blind, and lack of safe and independent mobility substantially impacts the quality of life of this population. Printed textual signs, which are ubiquitously used in sighted navigation, are inaccessible to visually impaired persons, and this lack of access to environmental information contributes significantly to the mobility problem. This research would help develop a system whereby blind persons could use commercially available smart-phones to locate and read sign text at a distance.            ",Sign Finding and Reading SFAR on GPU Accelerated Mobile Devices,8779810,R43EY024800,"['Acceleration', 'Access to Information', 'Algorithms', 'Antirrhinum', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Hybrids', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Modification', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Running', 'SKI gene', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'assistive device/technology', 'authority', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'next generation', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'public health relevance', 'volunteer']",NEI,"LYNNTECH, INC.",R43,2014,229742,0.0717455799020607

PERFORMANCE PERIOD 09/16/ This proposal describes enhancements to Viocare’s Mobile Food Intake Visual and Voice Recognizer (FIVR)  System, a novel combination of innovative technologies including computer vision and speech recognition to  measure dietary intake using a mobile phone. FIVR uses a mobile phone’s camera to capture a short video  of foods to be consumed, which is then verbally-annotated on the mobile phone by the user.

"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays.  This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment.  No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents.  Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image.  For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast.  These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view.  Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users.  Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures.  The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces  Title: Designing Visually Accessible Spaces NIH Program Announcement: 10-234 Bioengineering Research Partnerships (BRP)[R01] Abstract Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals, including those with physical disabilities, and to enhance safety for older people and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool enabling architectural design professionals to assess the visual accessibility of a wide range of environments (such as a hotel lobby, subway station, or eye-clinic reception area). This tool will simulate such environments with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or hazards, such as steps or benches, for different levels and types of low vision, and for spaces varying in lighting, surface properties and geometric arrangement. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments."" Our research plan has three specific goals: 1) Empirical: determine factors that influence low-vision accessibility related to hazard detection and navigation in real-world spaces. 2) Computational: develop working models to predict low vision visibility and navigability in real-world spaces. 3) Deployment: translate findings from basic vision science and clinical low vision into much needed industrial usage by producing a set of open source software modules to enhance architectural and lighting design for visual accessibility. The key scientific personnel in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota -- Gordon Legge and Daniel Kersten; University of Utah -- William Thompson and Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University -- Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the necessary areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility -- empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), computer graphics and photometrically accurate rendering (Thompson & Shakespeare) and architectural lighting design (Shakespeare). We have collaborative arrangements with additional architectural design professionals who will participate in the translation of our research and development into practice.

"Mobile Search for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The technology developed as part of this NIH SBIR project will transform the cell phone camera of visually impaired individuals into a powerful tool capable of identifying the objects they encounter, track the items they own, or navigate complex new environments. Broad access to low-cost visual intelligence technologies developed in this project will improve the independence and capabilities of the visually impaired. There has been tremendous technological progress in computer vision and in the computational power and network bandwidth of and Smartphone platforms. The synergy of these advances stands to revolutionize the way people find information and interact with the physical world. However, these technologies are not yet fully in the hands of the visually impaired, arguably the population that could benefit the most from these developments. Part of the barrier to progress in this area has been that computer vision can accurately handle only a small fraction of the typical images coming from a cell phone camera. To cope with these limitations and make any-image recognition possible, IQ Engines will develop a hybrid system that uses both computer vision and crowdsourcing: if the computer algorithms are not able to understand an image, then the image is sent to a unique crowdsourcing network of people for image analysis. The proposed research includes specific aims to both develop advanced computer vision algorithms for object recognition and advanced crowdsourced networks optimized to the needs of the visually impaired community. This approach combines the speed and accuracy of computer vision with the robustness and understanding of human vision, ultimately providing the user fast and accurate information about the content of any image.           The image recognition technology developed in this application will enable the visually impaired to access visual information using a mobile phone camera, a device most people already have.

"Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users  Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users Summary The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system that runs on smartphones and tablets to enable blind and visually impaired persons to read appliance displays. This ability is increasingly necessary to use a variety of household and commercial appliances equipped with displays, such as microwave ovens and thermostats, and is essential for independent living, education and employment. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed system runs as software on a standard, off-the-shelf smartphone or tablet and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze video images taken by the user and to detect and read the text within each image. For blind users, this text is either read aloud using synthesized speech, or for low vision users, presented in magnified, contrast- enhanced form (which is most suited to the use of a tablet).  We propose to build on our past work on a prototype display reader using powerful new techniques that will enable the resulting system to read a greater variety of LED/LCD display text fonts, and to better accommodate the conditions that often make reading displays difficult, including glare, reflections and poor contrast. These techniques include novel character recognition techniques adapted specifically to the domain of digital displays; finger detection to allow the user to point to a specific location of interest in the display; the use of display templates as reference images to match to, and thereby help interpret, noisy images of displays; and the integration of multiple views of the display into a single clear view. Special user interface features such as the use of finger detection to help blind users aim the camera towards the display and contrast-enhancement for low vision users address the particular needs of different users. Blind and visually impaired subjects will test the system periodically to provide feedback and performance data, driving the development and continual improvement of the system, which will be assessed with objective performance measures. The resulting display reader system will be released as an app for smartphones and tablets that can be downloaded and used by anybody for free, and also as an open source project that can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self-sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays.  The proposed research would result in a smartphone/tablet-based assistive technology system (available for free) to provide increased access to such display information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.                ",Providing Access to Appliance Displays for Visually Impaired Users,8579051,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Location', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'information display', 'interest', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2013,376082,0.14884887676983635
"Perception of Tactile Graphics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad objective of the proposed research is to answer the following question: why are tactile graphics difficult to understand? People with normal vision can easily recognize line drawings of objects. However, both blind and sighted people find it very difficult to recognize the same drawings when they are presented as tactile images. For blind people, tactile graphics are the only solution for accessing information in visual diagrams and illustrations found in textbooks. Consequently, the results of the proposed research will be used to improve the production of tactile graphics so that they are better understood by blind people. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) explore how the complexity of tactile images affects perception, 2) determine the effects of spatial and temporal integration on perception of tactile images, and 3) investigate how well people can recognize tactile images of objects embedded in backgrounds. The general methodology of the proposed experiments is to present participants with tactile images and to have them draw what they perceive the images to be. Blind individuals will draw tactile images using special paper and a stylus. The experimenters will evaluate the drawings by using a quantitative measure that computes a distance score reflecting the discrepancy between the original image and the participant's drawing. In the first study, participants will feel tactile stimuli of varying complexity, from simple lines in different orientations to complex depictions of objects. The second study will determine the limitations of tactile perceptual integration by limiting either the spatial or temporal window over which participants feel the image. Participants will either view or feel images through apertures of various sizes (spatial window) or they will have a limited amount of time to view or feel the images (temporal window). In the third study, participants will feel tactile images of objects embedded in simple backgrounds. This research will impact several areas of study, including computer vision, human object and scene recognition, and low vision rehabilitation.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance The proposed research seeks to improve the translation of visual graphics into tactile graphics for use by visually-impaired individuals. By making the information in visual graphics more accessible, this research will improve educational services for people with low vision. This work will also facilitate the development of better visual-to-tactile substitution technologies.

"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians Abstract Project Summary Urban intersections are among the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Building on our past work on a prototype ""Crosswatch"" system that uses computer vision algorithms to find crosswalks and Walk lights, we will greatly enhance the functionality of the system with information about the intersection layout and the identity of its connecting streets, the presence of stop signs, one-way signs and other controls indicating right-of-way, and timing information integrated from Walk/Don't Walk lights, countdown timers and other traffic lights. The system will convey intersection information, and will actively guide the user to align himself/herself with crosswalks, using a combination of synthesized speech and audio tones. We will conduct human factors studies to optimize the system functionality and the configuration of the user interface, as well as develop interactive training applications to equip users with the skills to better use the system. These training applications, implemented as additional cell phone software to complement the intersection system, will train users to hold the camera horizontal and forward and to minimize veer when traversing a crosswalk. The intersection analysis and training software will be made freely available for download onto popular cell phones (such as iPhone, Android or Symbian models). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.

"Mobile Search for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The technology developed as part of this NIH SBIR project will transform the cell phone camera of visually impaired individuals into a powerful tool capable of identifying the objects they encounter, track the items they own, or navigate complex new environments. Broad access to low-cost visual intelligence technologies developed in this project will improve the independence and capabilities of the visually impaired. There has been tremendous technological progress in computer vision and in the computational power and network bandwidth of and Smartphone platforms. The synergy of these advances stands to revolutionize the way people find information and interact with the physical world. However, these technologies are not yet fully in the hands of the visually impaired, arguably the population that could benefit the most from these developments. Part of the barrier to progress in this area has been that computer vision can accurately handle only a small fraction of the typical images coming from a cell phone camera. To cope with these limitations and make any-image recognition possible, IQ Engines will develop a hybrid system that uses both computer vision and crowdsourcing: if the computer algorithms are not able to understand an image, then the image is sent to a unique crowdsourcing network of people for image analysis. The proposed research includes specific aims to both develop advanced computer vision algorithms for object recognition and advanced crowdsourced networks optimized to the needs of the visually impaired community. This approach combines the speed and accuracy of computer vision with the robustness and understanding of human vision, ultimately providing the user fast and accurate information about the content of any image.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The image recognition technology developed in this application will enable the visually impaired to access visual information using a mobile phone camera, a device most people already have.

"Vision Without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera  Vision without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera Project Summary As computer vision object recognition algorithms improve in accuracy and speed, and computers become more powerful and compact, it is becoming increasingly practical to implement such algorithms on portable devices such as camera-enabled cell phones. This ""mobile vision"" approach allows normally sighted users to identify objects, signs, places and other features in the environment simply by snapping a photo and waiting a few seconds for the results of the object recognition analysis. The approach holds great promise for blind or visually impaired (VI) users, who may have no other means of identifying important features that are undetectable by non-visual cues. However, in order for the approach to be practical for VI users, the interaction between the user and the environment using the camera must be properly facilitated. For instance, since the user may not know in advance which direction to point the camera towards a desired target, he or she must be able to pan the camera left and right to search for it, and receive rapid feedback whenever it is detected. Drawing on past experience of the PI and his colaborators on object recognition systems for VI users, we propose to study the use of mobile vision technologies for exploring features in the environment, specificaly examining the process of discovering these features and obtaining guidance towards them. Our main objectives are to investigate the strategies adopted by users of these technologies to expedite the exploration process, devise and test maximally effective user interfaces consistent with these strategies, and to assess and benchmark the efficiency of the technologies. The result will be a set of minimum design standards that will specify the system performance parameters, the user interface functionality and the operational strategies necessary for any mobile vision object recognition system for VI users.  Vision without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera Project Narrative The ability to locate and identify objects, places and other features in the environment is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but this fundamental capability is missing or severely degraded in the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind.

"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.

Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team.

"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and  about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is  currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of  CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-  ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are,  they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms  2) Accommodative Mechanisms  3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms  There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term,  we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions  associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase t, we propose to:  ¿Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects  and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population  ¿Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms  ¿Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations  ¿Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product using both statistical   methods and subjective questionnaires n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,8203808,R41EY015023,"['Address', 'Age', 'Asthenopia', 'Back', 'Blurred vision', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Burns', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Headache', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Neck', 'Pain', 'Phase', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Shoulder', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'combat', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'eye dryness', 'improved', 'ocular surface', 'sex']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2011,47724,0.02890394236082448
"Vision Without Sight: Exploring the Environment with a Portable Camera    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As computer vision object recognition algorithms improve in accuracy and speed, and computers become more powerful and compact, it is becoming increasingly practical to implement such algorithms on portable devices such as camera-enabled cell phones. This ""mobile vision"" approach allows normally sighted users to identify objects, signs, places and other features in the environment simply by snapping a photo and waiting a few seconds for the results of the object recognition analysis. The approach holds great promise for blind or visually impaired (VI) users, who may have no other means of identifying important features that are undetectable by non-visual cues. However, in order for the approach to be practical for VI users, the interaction between the user and the environment using the camera must be properly facilitated. For instance, since the user may not know in advance which direction to point the camera towards a desired target, he or she must be able to pan the camera left and right to search for it, and receive rapid feedback whenever it is detected. Drawing on past experience of the PI and his collaborators on object recognition systems for VI users, we propose to study the use of mobile vision technologies for exploring features in the environment, specific examining the process of discovering these features and obtaining guidance towards them. Our main objectives are to investigate the strategies adopted by users of these technologies to expedite the exploration process, devise and test maximally effective user interfaces consistent with these strategies, and to assess and benchmark the efficiency of the technologies. The result will be a set of minimum design standards that will specify the system performance parameters, the user interface functionality and the operational strategies necessary for any mobile vision object recognition system for VI users.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to locate and identify objects, places and other features in the environment is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but this fundamental capability is missing or severely degraded in the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind. The proposed research would investigate how computer vision object recognition technologies, which are now being implemented on mobile vision devices such as cell phones but are typically designed for normally sighted users, could be modified and harnessed to meet the special needs of blind and visually impaired persons. Such research could lead to new technologies to dramatically improve independence for this population              The ability to locate and identify objects, places and other features in the environment is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but this fundamental capability is missing or severely degraded in the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind.

"Perception of Tactile Graphics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad objective of the proposed research is to answer the following question: why are tactile graphics difficult to understand? People with normal vision can easily recognize line drawings of objects. However, both blind and sighted people find it very difficult to recognize the same drawings when they are presented as tactile images. For blind people, tactile graphics are the only solution for accessing information in visual diagrams and illustrations found in textbooks. Consequently, the results of the proposed research will be used to improve the production of tactile graphics so that they are better understood by blind people. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) explore how the complexity of tactile images affects perception, 2) determine the effects of spatial and temporal integration on perception of tactile images, and 3) investigate how well people can recognize tactile images of objects embedded in backgrounds. The general methodology of the proposed experiments is to present participants with tactile images and to have them draw what they perceive the images to be. Blind individuals will draw tactile images using special paper and a stylus. The experimenters will evaluate the drawings by using a quantitative measure that computes a distance score reflecting the discrepancy between the original image and the participant's drawing. In the first study, participants will feel tactile stimuli of varying complexity, from simple lines in different orientations to complex depictions of objects. The second study will determine the limitations of tactile perceptual integration by limiting either the spatial or temporal window over which participants feel the image. Participants will either view or feel images through apertures of various sizes (spatial window) or they will have a limited amount of time to view or feel the images (temporal window). In the third study, participants will feel tactile images of objects embedded in simple backgrounds. This research will impact several areas of study, including computer vision, human object and scene recognition, and low vision rehabilitation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance The proposed research seeks to improve the translation of visual graphics into tactile graphics for use by visually-impaired individuals. By making the information in visual graphics more accessible, this research will improve educational services for people with low vision. This work will also facilitate the development of better visual-to-tactile substitution technologies.              Relevance The proposed research seeks to improve the translation of visual graphics into tactile graphics for use by visually-impaired individuals.

"A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Cell Phone-Based Street Intersection Analyzer for Visually Impaired Pedestrians Abstract Project Summary Urban intersections are among the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel. They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult. To alleviate this problem, we propose to develop and evaluate a cell phone-based system to analyze images of street intersections, taken by a blind or visually impaired person using a standard cell phone, to provide real-time feedback. Building on our past work on a prototype ""Crosswatch"" system that uses computer vision algorithms to find crosswalks and Walk lights, we will greatly enhance the functionality of the system with information about the intersection layout and the identity of its connecting streets, the presence of stop signs, one-way signs and other controls indicating right-of-way, and timing information integrated from Walk/Don't Walk lights, countdown timers and other traffic lights. The system will convey intersection information, and will actively guide the user to align himself/herself with crosswalks, using a combination of synthesized speech and audio tones. We will conduct human factors studies to optimize the system functionality and the configuration of the user interface, as well as develop interactive training applications to equip users with the skills to better use the system. These training applications, implemented as additional cell phone software to complement the intersection system, will train users to hold the camera horizontal and forward and to minimize veer when traversing a crosswalk. The intersection analysis and training software will be made freely available for download onto popular cell phones (such as iPhone, Android or Symbian models). The cell phone will not need any hardware modifications or add-ons to run this software. Ultimately a user will be able to download an entire suite of such algorithms for free onto the cell phone he or she is already likely to be carrying, without having to carry a separate piece of equipment for each function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.              The ability to walk safely and confidently along sidewalks and traverse crosswalks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task.

"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.        Re: Project Title: Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision  FOA: PHS 2009-02 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH, CDC, FDA and ACF for Small Business  Innovation Research Grant Applications (Parent SBIR [R43/R44])  Proposed project period: April 1, 2010 - March 31, 2012  Principal Investigator: Hallinan, Peter W.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility. The lead investigators in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota Gordon Legge, Daniel Kersten; University of Utah William Thompson, Peter Shirley, Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the four areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), photometrically correct computer graphics (Shirley), and architectural design and lighting (Shakespeare).           n/a",Designing Visually Accessible Spaces,8037680,R01EY017835,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'Central Scotomas', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lobbying', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Photometry', 'Published Comment', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Safety', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Space Perception', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'design', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'luminance', 'model design', 'model development', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2011,513228,0.10716203985821125

"Camera-based Text Recognition from Complex Backgrounds for the Blind or Visually There are more than 10 million blind and visually impaired people living in America today. Recent technology developments in computer vision, digital cameras, and portable computers make it possible to assist these individuals by developing camera-based products that combine computer vision technology with other existing products.  Although a number of reading assistants have been designed specifically for people who are blind or visually impaired, reading text from complex backgrounds or non-flat surfaces is very challenging and has not yet been successfully addressed. Many everyday tasks involve these challenging conditions, such as reading instructions on vending machines, titles of books aligned on a shelf, instructions on medicine bottles or labels on soup cans.  This proposal focuses on the development of new computer vision algorithms to recognize text from complex backgrounds: 1) from backgrounds with multiple different colors (e.g .. the titles of books lined up on a shelf) and 2) from non-flat surfaces (e.g .. labels on medicine bottles or soup cans). The newly developed computer vision techniques will be integrated with off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products. Visual information will be captured via a head-mounted camera (on sunglasses or hat) and analyzed by a portable computer (PDA or cell phone), while the speech display will be outputted via mini speakers, earphones, or Bluetooth device. A practical reading system prototype will be produced to read text from complex backgrounds and non-flat surfaces. The system will be cost-effective since it requires only a head mounted camera (<US$100 for 1M resolution), a wearable computer (<US$300), and two mini-speakers or earphones. The price of ""ReadIRlS"" [74] OCR software is under $150 and the ""TextAloud"" speech synthesis software is about $30 [75].  This project will be executed over two years at the City College of New York (CCNY) and Lighthouse International, New York. CCNY, located in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, is designated as both a Minority Institution and a Hispanic-serving Institution (37% Hispanic and 27% African American). Lighthouse International is a leading non-profit organization dedicated to preserving vision and to providing critically needed vision and rehabilitation services to help people of all ages overcome the challenges of vision loss. During the two years, we will 1) develop new algorithms to recognize text from backgrounds with multiple different colors; 2) develop new algorithms to recognize text from non-flat surfaces; and 3) develop a cost-effective prototype reading system for blind users by integrating with off-the-shelf optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products. The effectiveness of the prototype and algorithms will be evaluated by people with normal vision and people with vision impairment. A database of text on complex backgrounds (multiple colors and non-flat surfaces) will be created for algorithm and system evaluation. The database will be made available to research communities in the areas of computer vision and vision rehabilitation science. In summary, this effort will provide a research-based foundation to inform the design of next generation reading assistants for blind persons, as well as produce a practical prototype to help the blind user read text from complex backgrounds in real-world environments. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of the proposed research is to develop new computer vision algorithms for camera-based text recognition from complex backgrounds and non-flat surfaces, as well as produce a practical reading system prototype in combination with off-the-shelf  optical character recognition (OCR) and speech-synthesis software products, to help blind or visually impaired people read instructions on vending machines, titles of books aligned on a shelf, labels on medicine bottles or soup cans, etc. Visual information will be captured via a head-mounted camera (on sunglasses or hat) and analyzed in realtime through a portable computer, such as a mini laptop or a personal digital assistant (PDA). The speech display will be outputted via mini speakers, earphones, or Bluetooth device.",Camera-based Text Recognition from Complex Backgrounds for the Blind or Visually,7977496,R21EY020990,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'Books', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cities', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Mails', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Output', 'Personal Digital Assistant', 'Price', 'Printing', 'Reading', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'blind', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'laptop', 'next generation', 'optical character recognition', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation science', 'rehabilitation service', 'research and development', 'sunglasses', 'technology development', 'visual information']",NEI,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R21,2010,190000,0.09762333256059431
"A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system based on standard camera cell phones to give blind and visually impaired persons the ability to read appliance displays and similar forms of non-document visual information. This ability is increasingly necessary to use everyday appliances such as microwave ovens and DVD players, and to perform many daily activities such as counting paper money. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed software runs on a standard, off-the- shelf camera phone and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze images taken by the user, to detect and read the text within each image, and to then read it aloud using synthesized speech. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that current cellular phones easily exceed the minimum processing power required for these tasks. Initially, the software will read out three categories of symbols: LED/LCD appliance displays, product or user-defined barcodes, and denominations of paper money. Ultimately these functions will be integrated with other capabilities being developed under separate funding, such as reading a broad range of printed text (including signs), recognizing objects, and analyzing photographs and graphics, etc., all available as free or low-cost software downloads for any cell phone user. Our specific goals are to (1) gather a database of real images taken by blind and visually impaired persons of a variety of LED/LCD appliance displays, barcodes and US paper currency; (2) develop algorithms to process the images and extract the desired information; (3) implement the algorithms on a camera phone; and (4) conduct user testing to establish design parameters and optimize the human interface. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For blind and visually impaired persons, one of the most serious barriers to employment, economic self sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to the ever-increasing variety of devices and appliances in the home, workplace, school or university that incorporate visual LED/LCD displays, and to other types of text and symbolic information hitherto unaddressed by rehabilitation technology. The proposed research would result in an assistive technology system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to provide increased access to such display and non- document text information for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.          n/a",A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons,7799708,R01EY018890,"['Access to Information', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Auditory', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Electronics', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Lavandula', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modification', 'Paper', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Speech', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Voice', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'image processing', 'meetings', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'optical character recognition', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation technology', 'response', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'visual information', 'web site']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2010,427932,0.1293051352896728
"A Cell Phone-based Sign Reader for Blind & Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop and evaluate a cell-phone-based system to enable blind and visually impaired individuals to find and read street signs and other signs relevant to wayfinding. Using the built-in camera and computing power of a standard cell phone, the system will process images captured by the user to find and analyze signs, and speak their contents. This will provide valuable assistance for blind or visually impaired pedestrians in finding and reading street signs, as well as locating and identifying addresses and store names, without requiring them to carry any special-purpose hardware. The sign finding and reading software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). We will build on our prior and ongoing work in applying computer vision techniques to practical problem-solving for blind persons, including cell-phone implementation of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays. We will develop, refine and transfer to the cell phone platform a new belief propagation-based algorithm that has shown preliminary success in finding and analyzing signs under difficult real-world conditions including partial shadow coverage. Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. Access to environmental labels, signs or landmarks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.          n/a",A Cell Phone-based Sign Reader for Blind & Visually Impaired Persons,7911722,R01EY018210,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Belief', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Figs - dietary', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Modification', 'Names', 'Operating System', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'legally blind', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'way finding', 'web site']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2010,423145,0.050342371296562737
"A Texture Analysis/Synthesis Model of Visual Crowding    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying a visual stimulus can be substantially impaired by the mere presence of additional stimuli in the immediate vicinity. This phenomenon is called ""crowding,"" and it powerfully limits visual perception in many circumstances, especially in the peripheral visual field. There is a rich body of literature detailing the phenomenology of crowding, but we do not know why crowding occurs. We lack a computational model that can predict what information will be available to an observer in an arbitrary crowded display. A popular hypothesis is that crowding results from obligatory ""texture processing,"" but there have been few efforts to formalize and test what this might mean, despite broad agreement that crowding reflects some form of ""excessive integration."" Dr. Rosenholtz has extensive experience with computational models of texture processing, which are a powerful means of defining the exact nature of ""texture processing"" and testing the ability of such models to explain and predict visual behavior. The proposed research has 3 aims: (1) To clarify and formalize the hypothesis that crowding is due to a ""texture"" - i.e. statistical -- representation of the crowded stimuli. (2) To collect behavioral data from a wider variety of displays and tasks than is typically studied in crowding. (3) To develop and validate the first general-purpose model of visual crowding. To achieve these aims, Dr. Rosenholtz will apply state-of-the-art computational tools for texture synthesis to ""crowded"" stimuli. ""Texturizing"" crowded arrays of stimuli affords a tool for visualizing the information available in a crowded display and a vocabulary for describing its representational content. Thus, Dr. Rosenholtz will attack the problem of crowding through a useful synthesis of computer graphics, computer vision, and psychophysics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding crowding, besides elucidating representations and performance of normal human vision, is crucial for disorders like age-related macular degeneration, for which, without foveal vision, virtually all perception is essentially crowded. In addition, percepts under crowding may be related to percepts under other visual dysfunctions where there is ""excessive integration"", such as amblyopia and simultagnosia. Successfully predicting crowding severity would also advance the design of low-vision aids for older adults and improve our ability to design for the visually-impaired.            Understanding crowding, besides elucidating representations and performance of normal human vision, is crucial for disorders like age-related macular degeneration, for which, without foveal vision, virtually all perception is essentially crowded.

"Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Handsight is a mobile phone service that offers an affordable, extensible set of automated sight-assistant functions to millions of blind and low-vision persons at $30/month atop standard voice and data fees. To the user, Handsight is simply a mobile phone application, requiring no special equipment or updating. By aiming a mobile telephone<s camera in roughly the right direction and pressing just one button, a Handsight user can snap a picture, send it to the Handsight computer center along with location data, and have a response within seconds. Moving the key computation and data from the handset to web servers cut cost, eases technology upgrades, and enables numerous data and technology partnerships needed to rapidly solve a broad spectrum of tasks. To allow widespread adoption Handsight uses voice, keypad, and vibration for user interaction; and for extensibility it is built on open-source software both on the handset and on the web application infrastructure. The range of tasks encountered by the blind and low-vision requires an array of components to solve: some are more heavily text-oriented and involve no location/navigational feedback (distinguishing and identifying different medicines; finding the phone bill in a stack of letters); some are more specifically navigational (locating the exact store entrance, finding the bus stop); yet others are informational (finding out when the next bus is due). Since we aim to provide a broadly useful tool, Handsight has to accommodate the whole range of task types. We are therefore proposing to build an architecture that integrates a set of components addressing the various task types, from text-detection and recognition software to navigational databases. Handsight<s application programming interface (API) will enable third parties to add capabilities to solve new tasks. As a web service, Handsight can evolve as computer vision and navigation technologies advance without requiring users to upgrade handsets or buy new versions of software. Phase I of this project was funded by the Dept. of Education / NIDRR and completed successfully between 10/01/2007 and 04/01/2008 under grant # H133S070044. It demonstrated not just the viability of the proposed project but also likely demand for such a service. (The NIDRR<s immutable deadlines precluded us from pursuing a Phase II with that agency.) Phase II consists in building the cell phone application and remote processing infrastructure with APIs to enable plug-in of the basic and future features. Subcontractor Smith-Kettlewell Institute for Eye Research will assure usability by blind and low-vision users; data partner NAVTEQ will provide a range of leading-edge digital map data. Blindsight already owns fast, accurate text detection and recognition software, and has experience in building scalable web services. A minimum set of features that make for a system with widespread appeal will be developed and/or licensed, and integrated into the service.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Handsight service falls squarely in the NEI mission to support research and programs with respect to visual disorders and the special health problems and requirements of the blind. It aims to provide a maximum of mobility and independence to the blind and low-vision using today<s mobile phone infrastructure via automated web services, using a minimum of specialized hardware and training. The 3 million-plus blind and low-vision persons in the U.S. encounter barriers to such activities of daily living as travel, navigation, and shopping, reading and social interactions. The difficulty of recognizing when a friend is nearby, of finding a product in a grocery store, of making change or locating a destination building often require sighted friends or assistants to make these tasks possible. This is expensive, difficult to arrange, and increases dependence. The Handsight system will simplify or make possible to many a new set of tasks previously requiring human assistance or special-purpose devices.        Re: Project Title: Handsight: Mobile Services for Low Vision  FOA: PHS 2009-02 Omnibus Solicitation of the NIH, CDC, FDA and ACF for Small Business  Innovation Research Grant Applications (Parent SBIR [R43/R44])  Proposed project period: April 1, 2010 - March 31, 2012  Principal Investigator: Hallinan, Peter W.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility. The lead investigators in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota Gordon Legge, Daniel Kersten; University of Utah William Thompson, Peter Shirley, Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the four areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), photometrically correct computer graphics (Shirley), and architectural design and lighting (Shakespeare).           n/a",Designing Visually Accessible Spaces,7777764,R01EY017835,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Blindness', 'Central Scotomas', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lobbying', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Photometry', 'Published Comment', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Safety', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Space Perception', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'design', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'luminance', 'model design', 'model development', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2010,527186,0.10716203985821125
"Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low vision is a significant reduction of visual function that cannot be fully corrected by ordinary lenses, medical treatment, or surgery. Aging, injuries, and diseases can cause low vision. Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team.

"A Cell Phone-based Sign Reader for Blind & Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop and evaluate a cell-phone-based system to enable blind and visually impaired individuals to find and read street signs and other signs relevant to wayfinding. Using the built-in camera and computing power of a standard cell phone, the system will process images captured by the user to find and analyze signs, and speak their contents. This will provide valuable assistance for blind or visually impaired pedestrians in finding and reading street signs, as well as locating and identifying addresses and store names, without requiring them to carry any special-purpose hardware. The sign finding and reading software will be made freely available for download into any camera-equipped cell phone that uses the widespread Symbian operating system (such as the popular Nokia cell phone series). We will build on our prior and ongoing work in applying computer vision techniques to practical problem-solving for blind persons, including cell-phone implementation of algorithms for indoor wayfinding and for reading digital appliance displays. We will develop, refine and transfer to the cell phone platform a new belief propagation-based algorithm that has shown preliminary success in finding and analyzing signs under difficult real-world conditions including partial shadow coverage. Human factors studies will help determine how to configure the system and its user controls for maximum effectiveness and ease of use, and provide an evaluation of the overall system. Access to environmental labels, signs or landmarks is taken for granted every day by the sighted, but approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments and a million who are legally blind face severe difficulties in this task. The proposed research would result in a highly accessible system (with zero or minimal cost to users) to augment existing wayfinding techniques, which could dramatically improve independent travel for blind and visually impaired persons.          n/a",A Cell Phone-based Sign Reader for Blind & Visually Impaired Persons,7373002,R01EY018210,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Belief', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Figs - dietary', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Modification', 'Names', 'Operating System', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'legally blind', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'way finding', 'web site']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2009,417177,0.050342371296562737
"A Texture Analysis/Synthesis Model of Visual Crowding    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying a visual stimulus can be substantially impaired by the mere presence of additional stimuli in the immediate vicinity. This phenomenon is called ""crowding,"" and it powerfully limits visual perception in many circumstances, especially in the peripheral visual field. There is a rich body of literature detailing the phenomenology of crowding, but we do not know why crowding occurs. We lack a computational model that can predict what information will be available to an observer in an arbitrary crowded display. A popular hypothesis is that crowding results from obligatory ""texture processing,"" but there have been few efforts to formalize and test what this might mean, despite broad agreement that crowding reflects some form of ""excessive integration."" Dr. Rosenholtz has extensive experience with computational models of texture processing, which are a powerful means of defining the exact nature of ""texture processing"" and testing the ability of such models to explain and predict visual behavior. The proposed research has 3 aims: (1) To clarify and formalize the hypothesis that crowding is due to a ""texture"" - i.e. statistical -- representation of the crowded stimuli. (2) To collect behavioral data from a wider variety of displays and tasks than is typically studied in crowding. (3) To develop and validate the first general-purpose model of visual crowding. To achieve these aims, Dr. Rosenholtz will apply state-of-the-art computational tools for texture synthesis to ""crowded"" stimuli. ""Texturizing"" crowded arrays of stimuli affords a tool for visualizing the information available in a crowded display and a vocabulary for describing its representational content. Thus, Dr. Rosenholtz will attack the problem of crowding through a useful synthesis of computer graphics, computer vision, and psychophysics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding crowding, besides elucidating representations and performance of normal human vision, is crucial for disorders like age-related macular degeneration, for which, without foveal vision, virtually all perception is essentially crowded. In addition, percepts under crowding may be related to percepts under other visual dysfunctions where there is ""excessive integration"", such as amblyopia and simultagnosia. Successfully predicting crowding severity would also advance the design of low-vision aids for older adults and improve our ability to design for the visually-impaired.            Understanding crowding, besides elucidating representations and performance of normal human vision, is crucial for disorders like age-related macular degeneration, for which, without foveal vision, virtually all perception is essentially crowded.

"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility.

"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD.

"Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low vision is a significant reduction of visual function that cannot be fully corrected by ordinary lenses, medical treatment, or surgery. Aging, injuries, and diseases can cause low vision. Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team. The Principal Investigator is Dr. Norberto Grzywacz from Biomedical Engineering at USC. Drs. Gerard Medioni from Computer Science and Bartlett Mel from Biomedical Engineering at USC will lead the efforts in Specific Aims 1 and 2 respectively. Drs. Bosco Tjan from USC Psychology, Susana Chung from the University of Houston, and Eli Peli from Harvard Medical School will lead Specific Aim 3. Other scientists are from USC. They include Dr. Irving Biederman from Psychology, an object-recognition expert and Dr. Mark Humayun, from Ophthalmology, an AMD expert.

"A Non-Document Text and Display Reader for Visually Impaired Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system based on standard camera cell phones to give blind and visually impaired persons the ability to read appliance displays and similar forms of non-document visual information. This ability is increasingly necessary to use everyday appliances such as microwave ovens and DVD players, and to perform many daily activities such as counting paper money. No access to this information is currently afforded by conventional text reading systems such as optical character recognition (OCR), which is intended for reading printed documents. Our proposed software runs on a standard, off-the- shelf camera phone and uses computer vision algorithms to analyze images taken by the user, to detect and read the text within each image, and to then read it aloud using synthesized speech. Preliminary feasibility studies indicate that current cellular phones easily exceed the minimum processing power required for these tasks. Initially, the software will read out three categories of symbols: LED/LCD appliance displays, product or user-defined barcodes, and denominations of paper money. Ultimately these functions will be integrated with other capabilities being developed under separate funding, such as reading a broad range of printed text (including signs), recognizing objects, and analyzing photographs and graphics, etc., all available as free or low-cost software downloads for any cell phone user. Our specific goals are to (1) gather a database of real images taken by blind and visually impaired persons of a variety of LED/LCD appliance displays, barcodes and US paper currency; (2) develop algorithms to process the images and extract the desired information; (3) implement the algorithms on a camera phone; and (4) conduct user testing to establish design parameters and optimize the human interface.

"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to build and test a ""Smart Telescope,"" a device for persons with low vision that uses computer vision algorithms to search for, detect and enhance targets such as text and faces to aid in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. The practical, cosmetically acceptable packaging will consist of a miniature camera and visual display discreetly mounted on spectacles or a hat, and a compact computing device and set of controls that fit into a pocket. The Smart Telescope advances today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by automatically searching for, detecting and enhancing target objects even when they fill only a small portion of the device's field of view, without the user having to point the device directly or accurately at the target as with optical telescopes. The Smart Telescope is small and lightweight, but large enough for the elderly to handle and control; simple to operate and easy to carry, store, recharge, don and remove. Advanced options are hidden during day-to-day use, but easy to access when necessary. In Phase I, we developed and evaluated a working prototype and received enthusiastic feedback from subjects in our target population. In Phase II we propose to prototype a commercially viable consumer version of the Smart Telescope. The Phase II work plan has four tracks: 1) User interaction and interface design, 2) physical design and configuration, 3) software design and development, and 4) hardware design and development. Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) will provide expertise for the human factors portions of the project. Blindsight will design and build the device hardware from off-the-shelf components with the help of Bolton Engineering. Low vision experts Drs. Don Fletcher, Melissa Chun and Ian Bailey will work with the RERC to guarantee a practical product for the target audience. The overall aim is to create a commercial version of the proposed device for persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems, increasing mobility and independence for those with acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600. At under $1,000, the total market for such a device is estimated at up to 300,000, i.e., 10% of low vision persons in the United States. The commercial version of the Smart Telescope will significantly increase mobility and independence for persons with visual acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600, aiding them in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation, and social interactions. It will advance today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by improving on and surpassing the capabilities of the traditional optical telescope, greatly benefiting persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems.          n/a",A Smart Telescope for Low Vision,7486800,R44EY014487,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Macular degeneration', 'Marketing', 'Melissa', 'Optics', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Research', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Design', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'day', 'design', 'improved', 'low vision telescope', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation engineering']",NEI,BLINDSIGHT CORPORATION,R44,2008,434041,0.07939817955505583

"Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low vision is a significant reduction of visual function that cannot be fully corrected by ordinary lenses, medical treatment, or surgery. Aging, injuries, and diseases can cause low vision. Its leading causes and those of blindness, include cataracts and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), both of which are more prevalent in the elderly population. Our overarching goal is to develop devices to aid people with low vision. We propose to use techniques of computer vision and computational neuroscience to build systems that enhance natural images. We plan test these systems on normal people and visually impaired older adults, with and without AMD. We have three milestones to reach: 1) Our first milestone will be to develop a system for low-noise image-contrast enhancement, which should help with AMD, because it causes lower contrast sensitivity. 2) Our second milestone will be a system that extracts the main contours of images in a cortical-like manner. Superimposing these contours on images should help with contrast-sensitivity problems at occlusion boundaries. Diffusing regions inside contours should help with crowding problems prominent in AMD. 3) Our third milestone is to probe whether these systems can help people with low vision people. For this purpose, we plan to use a battery of search and recognition psychophysical tests tailor-made for AMD. We put together an interdisciplinary team. The Principal Investigator is Dr. Norberto Grzywacz from Biomedical Engineering at USC. Drs. Gerard Medioni from Computer Science and Bartlett Mel from Biomedical Engineering at USC will lead the efforts in Specific Aims 1 and 2 respectively. Drs. Bosco Tjan from USC Psychology, Susana Chung from the University of Houston, and Eli Peli from Harvard Medical School will lead Specific Aim 3. Other scientists are from USC. They include Dr. Irving Biederman from Psychology, an object-recognition expert and Dr. Mark Humayun, from Ophthalmology, an AMD expert. They also include Dr. lone Fine, from Ophthalmology, an expert in people who recover vision after a prolonged period without it and Dr. Zhong-Lin Lu, an expert on motion perception and perceptual learning.           n/a",Mid-Level Vision Systems for Low Vision,7172503,R01EY016093,"['Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Cataract', 'Clutterings', 'Cognitive', 'Color Visions', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consultations', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Crowding', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Esthetics', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inferior', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Motion Perception', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Perceptual learning', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Retina', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Skiing', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Aid', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'fovea centralis', 'human subject', 'improved', 'lens', 'medical schools', 'member', 'object recognition', 'symposium', 'tool', 'vision science', 'visual performance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2007,1159531,0.1272025726507171
"Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to tackle the problem of way finding (finding one's way in an environment), faced by blind and severely visually impaired persons who are unable to find or read signs, landmarks and locations. We propose a novel and very inexpensive environmental labeling system to provide this population with access to information needed for indoor way finding (where GPS is not available). The system uses simple passive landmark symbols printed on paper or other material, placed next to text, Braille signs or barcode at locations of interest (offices, bathrooms, etc.) in an environment such as an office building. These printed patterns contain spatial and semantic information that is detected using computer vision algorithms running on a standard camera cell phone. By scanning the environment with the device, which detects all landmark symbols in its line of sight up to distances of 10 meters, the user can determine his or her approximate location in the environment as well as the information encoded near each landmark symbol. The system extracts this information in real-time and communicates it to the user by sound, synthesized speech and/or tactile feedback. This information includes spatial (e.g. audio tones to indicate the presence and direction of a label in the camera's field of view) and semantic information (""Mr. Johnson's office, room 429, at 11 o'clock""). The research proposed here will produce a prototype system that will be tested by blind and low vision subjects. Our team includes a blind expert on psychoacoustics (and other in-house blind staff) and an expert consultant on low-vision way finding and navigation to help optimize the user interface and guide development into a practical, easy-to-use system.              n/a",Wayfinding for the blind & visually impaired using passive environmental labels,7295688,R21EY017003,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Auditory', 'Bar Codes', 'Canes', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clutterings', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Complement component C1s', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Label', 'Localized', 'Location', 'Modality', 'Museums', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Psychoacoustics', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'interest', 'legally blind', 'meter', 'novel', 'optical character recognition', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'size', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'symposium', 'way finding']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2007,193398,0.0977088612093
"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to build and test a ""Smart Telescope,"" a device for persons with low vision that uses computer vision algorithms to search for, detect and enhance targets such as text and faces to aid in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. The practical, cosmetically acceptable packaging will consist of a miniature camera and visual display discreetly mounted on spectacles or a hat, and a compact computing device and set of controls that fit into a pocket. The Smart Telescope advances today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by automatically searching for, detecting and enhancing target objects even when they fill only a small portion of the device's field of view, without the user having to point the device directly or accurately at the target as with optical telescopes. The Smart Telescope is small and lightweight, but large enough for the elderly to handle and control; simple to operate and easy to carry, store, recharge, don and remove. Advanced options are hidden during day-to-day use, but easy to access when necessary. In Phase I, we developed and evaluated a working prototype and received enthusiastic feedback from subjects in our target population. In Phase II we propose to prototype a commercially viable consumer version of the Smart Telescope. The Phase II work plan has four tracks: 1) User interaction and interface design, 2) physical design and configuration, 3) software design and development, and 4) hardware design and development. Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center (RERC) will provide expertise for the human factors portions of the project. Blindsight will design and build the device hardware from off-the-shelf components with the help of Bolton Engineering. Low vision experts Drs. Don Fletcher, Melissa Chun and Ian Bailey will work with the RERC to guarantee a practical product for the target audience. The overall aim is to create a commercial version of the proposed device for persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems, increasing mobility and independence for those with acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600. At under $1,000, the total market for such a device is estimated at up to 300,000, i.e., 10% of low vision persons in the United States. The commercial version of the Smart Telescope will significantly increase mobility and independence for persons with visual acuity between approximately 20/200 and 20/600, aiding them in everyday tasks such as travel, navigation, and social interactions. It will advance today's state of the art in assistive devices for low vision by improving on and surpassing the capabilities of the traditional optical telescope, greatly benefiting persons with reduced visual acuity, reduced contrast sensitivity, or other loss of visual function caused by macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems.          n/a",A Smart Telescope for Low Vision,7327116,R44EY014487,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Back', 'Cataract', 'Clutterings', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'Macular degeneration', 'Marketing', 'Melissa', 'Motion', 'Optics', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Design', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'day', 'design', 'improved', 'low vision telescope', 'monocular', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation engineering']",NEI,BLINDSIGHT CORPORATION,R44,2007,448477,0.07939817955505583
"Designing Visually Accessible Spaces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduced mobility is one of the most debilitating consequences of vision loss for more than three million Americans with low vision. We define visual accessibility as the use of vision to travel efficiently and safely through an environment, to perceive the spatial layout of key features in the environment, and to keep track of one's location in the environment. Our long-term goal is to create tools to enable the design of safe environments for the mobility of low-vision individuals and to enhance safety for the elderly and others who may need to operate under low lighting and other visually challenging conditions. We plan to develop a computer-based design tool in which environments (such as a hotel lobby, large classroom, or hospital reception area), could be simulated with sufficient accuracy to predict the visibility of key landmarks or obstacles, such as steps or benches, under differing lighting conditions. Our project addresses one of the National Eye Institute's program objectives: ""Develop a knowledge base of design requirements for architectural structures, open spaces, and parks and the devices necessary for optimizing the execution of navigation and other everyday tasks by people with visual impairments"". Our research plan has four specific goals: 1) Develop methods for predicting the physical levels of light reaching the eye in existing or planned architectural spaces. 2) Acquire performance data for normally sighted subjects with visual restrictions and people with low vision to investigate perceptual capabilities critical to visually-based mobility. 3) Develop models that can predict perceptual competence on tasks critical to visually-based mobility. 4) Demonstrate a proof-of-concept software tool that operates on design models from existing architectural design systems and is able to highlight potential obstacles to visual accessibility. The lead investigators in our partnership come from three institutions: University of Minnesota Gordon Legge, Daniel Kersten; University of Utah William Thompson, Peter Shirley, Sarah Creem-Regehr; and Indiana University Robert Shakespeare. This interdisciplinary team has expertise in the four areas required for programmatic research on visual accessibility empirical studies of normal and low vision (Legge, Kersten, Creem-Regehr, and Thompson), computational modeling of perception (Legge, Kersten, and Thompson), photometrically correct computer graphics (Shirley), and architectural design and lighting (Shakespeare).           n/a",Designing Visually Accessible Spaces,7172766,R01EY017835,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lobbying', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'National Eye Institute', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Photometry', 'Published Comment', 'Range', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Safety', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Space Models', 'Space Perception', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'concept', 'design', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'luminance', 'model design', 'model development', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2007,487230,0.10716203985821125
"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD.

"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data.

"Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to explore, develop and test computer vision algorithms to analyze images of street intersections from a camera worn by a blind person.  Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel.  They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult.  We will explore computer vision algorithms to help a blind person find the crosswalk, find the pedestrian signal button, determine when the ""walk"" light is on, and alert him/her to any veering out of the crosswalk.  We will emphasize the development of completely novel methods of analyzing non-ideal images including shadows, occlusions and other irregularities using spatial grouping techniques based on Bayesian inference.  The resulting algorithms are intended for eventual integration as modules for a computer vision system we are already developing to help blind persons with travel tasks such as finding and reading aloud printed signs and negotiating street crossings.  The combined system would have potential for a radical advance in independent travel for blind persons.  In this exploratory project, we aim to: (1) Explore and test alternative approaches to algorithm design to process intersection images and extract the information about the crosswalk, crossing signal, etc., using a database of real-world images taken by blind persons at a variety of different kinds of intersections.  (2) Test the algorithms using a portable camera connected to a notebook computer with speech output. n/a",Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind,7096566,R21EY015187,"['blind aid', 'blindness', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'gait', 'human subject', 'injury prevention', 'mathematical model', 'statistics /biometry', 'transportation /recreation safety', 'urban area']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2006,214738,0.08774427407040265
"Instrument development & fabrication for vision research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this proposal is to enhance the research capabilities and collaborative efforts of the vision researchers at the Columbia University Medical Center.  State-of-the-art vision research often requires the custom fabrication of mechanical instruments to support the research. Support is requested for a single module to renovate and support the machine shop in the Harkness Eye Institute at Columbia University, to be shared primarily between the Department of Ophthalmology and the Mahoney Center for Brain and Behavior.  The module will have 10 users, 7 of whom have NEI-funded RO1 grants, and 3 of whom perform research in the area of visual systems neuroscience on grants funded by the NIMH. All of the investigators are also mentors on an NEI-funded training grant. The current systems projects include studies of the neurophysiology   and psychophysics of spatial vision, visual attention, early cortical processing, visual emotional association, and visual motion; the cellular and molecular projects include studies of fluid transport across corneal epithelium, retinal axon guidance, ocular wound healing, and the impact of the lipofuscin fluorophores on retinal pigmented epithelial cell function and viability. All of these projects require the development and fabrication of devices primarily designed for a given project. A great number of these can, when perfected, be shared among a number of projects. Examples of such devices include custom-made nanoliter injection devices, recording chambers, multiple-microdrive platforms, dual recording-iontophoretic devices, illumination devices, and recording gdds. The PI has extensive experience collaborating with machinists, and several of the devices in whose development he participated have been marketed commercially.  Currently the Department of Ophthalmology has a fully-equipped machine shop the machines of which are all fine old Bridgeport and Hardinge manual machines. This proposal is to upgrade the machine shop, with a computer-controlled lathe and a computer-controlled milling machine, and to support the salary of the machinist who was hired in June, 2003, using university startup funds. The availability of an in-house professionally certified machinist will significantly speed the process of design and fabrication of custom instruments.

"MobileEye OCR for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this SBIR we propose to demonstrate the technical feasibility of Mobile OCR, a portable software system which makes use of existing personal devices to provide access to textual materials for the elderly or the visually impaired. The system will help these low vision individuals with basic daily activities, such as shopping, preparing meals, taking medication, and reading traffic signs. It will step beyond our proposed MobileEyes vision enhancement system to apply cutting edge recognition technology for mobile devices. The system will use common camera phone hardware to capture and enhance textual information, perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and provide audio or visual feedback. Our research will focus on implementing and integrating new vision enhancement and analysis techniques on limited resource mobile devices. Specifically, we will develop algorithms for detection and rectification of text on planes and generalized cylinders subject to perspective distortions, implement more robust and efficient algorithms and systems for stabilization and enhancement of text blocks, provide mobile OCR on complex textured backgrounds, and implement these techniques on small devices across a variety of platforms. The recognized text will be presented through Text-to-Speech (TTS), or displayed on the device with enhanced quality which can be easily read by low vision users. Phase I will focus on demonstrating the technical feasibility of our approach, and will incorporate a performance measurement methodology to quantitatively evaluate progress and evaluate our system against other approaches. In comparison to existing vision enhancement devices, such as magnifying glasses, telescopes, and text reading devices such as scanner-based OCR, our solution has several advantages: 1) it makes use of a single, portable device (camera cell phone) that is commonly available and typically already carried for its telecommunications capabilities; 2) it can be used selectively by users so they will not be overwhelmed by irrelevant information; and 3) it can be integrated directly with other applications for specialized tasks. Our research results will impact the millions of low-vision individuals and the blind, as well as vision and computer vision researchers.

"A Smart Telescope for Low Vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to test the feasibility of a ""Smart Telescope"" for use to improve the ability of visually impaired persons in tasks such as travel, navigation and social interactions. Advances in low-power high-speed portable computers combined with novel computer vision algorithms enable us to build an affordable, portable, and cosmetically acceptable digital telescope that can enable visually impaired persons to perform these tasks with greater ease than with current telescopes.        The computer vision algorithms first detect regions of interest in an image where targets are likely to be, even if these targets occupy only a small portion of the visual field, obviating the need for a user to scan or search a scene as would be necessary with an ordinary telescope.

"Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to explore, develop and test computer vision algorithms to analyze images of street intersections from a camera worn by a blind person.  Urban intersections are the most dangerous parts of a blind person's travel.  They are becoming increasingly complex, making safe crossing using conventional blind orientation and mobility techniques ever more difficult.  We will explore computer vision algorithms to help a blind person find the crosswalk, find the pedestrian signal button, determine when the ""walk"" light is on, and alert him/her to any veering out of the crosswalk.  We will emphasize the development of completely novel methods of analyzing non-ideal images including shadows, occlusions and other irregularities using spatial grouping techniques based on Bayesian inference.  The resulting algorithms are intended for eventual integration as modules for a computer vision system we are already developing to help blind persons with travel tasks such as finding and reading aloud printed signs and negotiating street crossings.  The combined system would have potential for a radical advance in independent travel for blind persons.  In this exploratory project, we aim to: (1) Explore and test alternative approaches to algorithm design to process intersection images and extract the information about the crosswalk, crossing signal, etc., using a database of real-world images taken by blind persons at a variety of different kinds of intersections.  (2) Test the algorithms using a portable camera connected to a notebook computer with speech output. n/a",Traffic Intersection Analysis Algorithms for the Blind,6920594,R21EY015187,"['blind aid', 'blindness', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'gait', 'human subject', 'injury prevention', 'mathematical model', 'statistics /biometry', 'transportation /recreation safety', 'urban area']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2005,255198,0.08774427407040265
"Instrument development & fabrication for vision research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this proposal is to enhance the research capabilities and collaborative efforts of the vision researchers at the Columbia University Medical Center.  State-of-the-art vision research often requires the custom fabrication of mechanical instruments to support the research. Support is requested for a single module to renovate and support the machine shop in the Harkness Eye Institute at Columbia University, to be shared primarily between the Department of Ophthalmology and the Mahoney Center for Brain and Behavior.  The module will have 10 users, 7 of whom have NEI-funded RO1 grants, and 3 of whom perform research in the area of visual systems neuroscience on grants funded by the NIMH. All of the investigators are also mentors on an NEI-funded training grant. The current systems projects include studies of the neurophysiology   and psychophysics of spatial vision, visual attention, early cortical processing, visual emotional association, and visual motion; the cellular and molecular projects include studies of fluid transport across corneal epithelium, retinal axon guidance, ocular wound healing, and the impact of the lipofuscin fluorophores on retinal pigmented epithelial cell function and viability. All of these projects require the development and fabrication of devices primarily designed for a given project. A great number of these can, when perfected, be shared among a number of projects. Examples of such devices include custom-made nanoliter injection devices, recording chambers, multiple-microdrive platforms, dual recording-iontophoretic devices, illumination devices, and recording gdds. The PI has extensive experience collaborating with machinists, and several of the devices in whose development he participated have been marketed commercially.  Currently the Department of Ophthalmology has a fully-equipped machine shop the machines of which are all fine old Bridgeport and Hardinge manual machines. This proposal is to upgrade the machine shop, with a computer-controlled lathe and a computer-controlled milling machine, and to support the salary of the machinist who was hired in June, 2003, using university startup funds. The availability of an in-house professionally certified machinist will significantly speed the process of design and fabrication of custom instruments.

"Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research program is to develop computer software tools with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform instantaneous, automated analysis and clinical interpretation of wavefront error measurements of the human eye and cornea. Secondary goals are to improve the overall design of oculometric data visualization tools, provide information that will help to establish clinical and scientific standards for ocular measurements and procedures, and improve our understanding of the fundamental relationship between optical performance and visual performance. We hypothesize that a) AI-based algorithms will detect complex patterns of wavefront errors; b) these patterns are specific to and significantly correlated with certain diseases and disorders; and c) AI-based interpretation of complex data will be superior to that performed by expert humans, who are the gold standard for interpreting clinical data. Specifically, we will (1) develop, train, and test AI-based algorithms (Bayesian and neural networks) to interpret the significance of complex wavefront error data obtained retrospectively from examination records of patients with various ocular diseases, disorders, or surgical interventions, as well as normal eyes; (2) simulate wavefront error data using computer models based on statistical distributions of actual ocular aberrations from patient population samples for the purpose of investigating the importance of individual higher order aberrations to retinal image formation and potential visual performance, as well as to generate new data that will enhance the overall AI training and testing process, and (3) establish standard methods to acquire and analyze wavefront error data. AI-based tools will assist vision scientists to efficiently develop study databases and analyze aberration data. Clinicians will diagnose patients faster, more accurately, and with a greater degree of confidence. For patients, refractive surgery outcomes will be more predictable, and they will benefit from earlier detection of diseases such as cataracts and corneal ectasias.         n/a",Computer-Aided Interpretation of Oculometric Data,6774688,R01EY014162,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'eye refractometry', 'human data', 'image processing', 'ophthalmoscopy']",NEI,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV HSC NEW ORLEANS,R01,2004,242058,0.017394959715882976
"Locating and Reading Informational Signs  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to construct computer vision systems to enable the blind and severely visually impaired to detect and read informational text in city scenes. The informational text can be street signs, bus numbers hospital signs, supermarket signs, and names of products (eg. Kellogg's cornflakes). We will construct portable prototype computer vision systems implemented by digital cameras attached to personal, or hand held, computers. The camera need only be pointed in the general direction of the text (so the text is only one percent of the image). A speech synthesizer will read the text to the user. Blind and visually impaired users will test the device in the field (under supervision) and give feedback to improve the algorithms. We argue that this work will make a significant contribution to improving human health (rehabilitation). Computer vision is a rapidly maturing technology with immense potential to help the blind and visually impaired. Reports suggest that detecting and reading informational text is one of the main unsatisfied desires of these groups. Written signs and information in the environment are used for navigation, shopping, operating equipment, identifying buses, and many other purposes (to which a blind person does not otherwise have independent access). The blind and severely visually impaired make up a large fraction of the US population (3 million). Moreover, this proportion is expected to increase by a factor of two in the next ten years due to increased life expectancy. Our proposal is design-driven. It uses a new class of computer vision algorithms known as Data Driven Monte Carlo (DDMCMC). The algorithms are used to: (i) search for text, and (ii) to read it. Recent developments in digital cameras and portable/handheld computers make it practical to implement these algorithms in portable prototype systems. The three scientists in this proposal have the necessary expertise to accomplish it. Dr.'s Yuille and Zhu have backgrounds in computer vision and Dr. Brabyn has experience in developing and testing engineering systems to help the blind and visually impaired.

"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are, they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms   2) Accommodative Mechanisms   3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms   There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term, we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase 1, we propose to:   Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population   Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms   Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations   Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product      using both statistical methods and subjective questionnaires.            n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,6792878,R41EY015023,"['age difference', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computers', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'gender difference', 'human subject', 'keratoconjunctivitis sicca', 'occupational health /safety', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'questionnaires', 'syndrome', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders', 'visual photosensitivity', 'work site']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2004,100000,0.030527666124363608

The blind and severely visually impaired make up a large fraction of the US population (3 million). Moreover, this proportion is expected to increase by a factor of two in the next ten years due to increased life expectancy. Our proposal is design-driven. It uses a new class of computer vision algorithms known as Data Driven Monte Carlo (DDMCMC). The algorithms are used to: (i) search for text, and (ii) to read it. Recent developments in digital cameras and portable/handheld computers make it practical to implement these algorithms in portable prototype systems. The three scientists in this proposal have the necessary expertise to accomplish it. Dr.'s Yuille and Zhu have backgrounds in computer vision and Dr. Brabyn has experience in developing and testing engineering systems to help the blind and visually impaired. Our proposal falls within the scope of the Bioengineering initiative because we are applying techniques from the mathematical/engineering sciences to develop informatic approaches for patient rehabilitation. More specifically, our work will facilitate the development of portable devices to help the blind and visually impaired.   n/a",Locating and Reading Informational Signs,6547549,R01EY013875,"['blind aid', ' blindness', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' cues', ' human subject', ' reading', ' vision aid', ' vision disorders']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2002,338540,0.14235377699462998

"SIGN FINDER: COMPUTER VISION TO FIND AND READ SIGNS In this Phase l proposal we plan to develop and test a new vision technology to locat and read general informational signs (street names, building directories, office door plates) and location and directional signs (EXIT, Information, aisle signs in supermarkets). To strengthen feasibility, we will target a restricted class of signs: those consisting primarily of one- color text on a different one-color background, and whose shape falls within a prescribed set. The intended market is for people who are blind or whose sight is impaired and hence cannot read these signs unaided. Our approach makes extensive use of recently developed computer vision recognition algorithms. We also make use of the Smith-Kettlewell's Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center's expertise for determining what the potential users will require from such a system. The ultimate goal, for Phase II, is to build and test a highly portable PC- based device implementing this vision technology using a CCD camera as input and a voice-generator as output. The user would scan/point the device at a scene and it would locate and read one or more signs. Given the pace of increase in power and decrease in size of computing devices, a hand-held Sign-Finder system may be plausible to build entirely with commercial, off-the-shelf hardware in two to three years.

"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user’s location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user’s location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user’s trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings.

"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Abstract COVID-19 has made traveling as a blind or visually impaired person much riskier and more difficult than before the pandemic. As a result, people with visual impairments may limit their essential travel such as trips to the doctor’s office, the pharmacy and grocery shopping and walks for exercise or leisure. Accordingly, the goal of this COVID Supplement, which builds on and expands the work being conducted by the parent grant, is to develop a COVID map tool that provides fully accessible, non-visual access to maps. This tool will allow visually impaired persons to explore maps and preview routes from the comfort of their home, allowing them to plan their travel along safer, less congested routes using crowdedness data. In addition, the tool will present county-by-county COVID incidence data in a fully accessible form, which will inform their travel plans over greater distances. Thus, this project will give visually impaired persons the tools and confidence to undertake safer, more independent travel. Health Relevance The COVID-19 pandemic has an especially severe impact on people with significant vision impairments or blindness. The need for social distancing and reduced touching of one’s surroundings has made traveling as a blind or visually impaired person much riskier and more difficult than before the pandemic. As a result, people with visual impairments may limit their essential travel such as trips to the doctor’s office, the pharmacy and grocery shopping and walks for exercise or leisure.

"SCH: INT: Conversations for Vision: Human-Computer Synergies in Prosthetic Interactions  The project will investigate prosthetic support for people with visual impairment (PVI) that integrates computer vision-based prosthetics with video-mediated human-in-the-loop prosthetics. Computer vision- based (CV) prosthetics construe the fundamental technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of parsing and identifying objects across scales, distances, and orientations. Visual prosthetic applications have been central drivers in the development of computer vision technology through the past 50 years. Video-mediated remote sighted assistance (RSA) prosthetics are more recent, enabled by different technologies, and construe the orienting technical challenge for visual prosthetics as one of effective helping interactions. RSA services are commercially available now, and have evoked much excitement in the PVI community. The two approaches, CV and RSA, will be successively integrated through a series of increasingly refined Wizard of Oz simulations, and investigate possible synergies between the two approaches. We will employ a human-centered design approach, identifying a set of key assistive interaction scenarios that represent authentic needs and concerns of PVIs, by leveraging our 6-year relationship working directly with our local chapter of the National Federation of the Blind.

"Gaze-contingent computer screen magnification control for people with low vision ! Project Summary This application describes proposed research with the goal of facilitating use of a computer screen magnifier by people with low vision. Screen magnification is a well-established, popular technology for access of onscreen content. Its main shortcoming is that it requires the user to continuously control, with the mouse or trackpad, the location of the focus of magnification, in order to ensure that the magnified content of interest is within the screen viewport. This tedious process may be time-consuming and ineffective. For example, the simple task of reading the news on a web site requires continuous horizontal scrolling, which affects the experience of using this otherwise very beneficial technology, and may discourage its use, especially by those with poor manual coordination.  We propose to develop a software system that enables hands-free control of a screen magnifier. This system will rely on the user’s eye gaze (measured by a regular IR-based tracker, or from analysis of the images in a camera embedded in the screen) to update the location of the focus of magnification as desired. This research is inspired by preliminary work, which showed promising results with two simple gaze-based control algorithms, tested on three individuals with low vision.  This project will be a collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz (PI: Manduchi, Co-I: Prado) and the School of Optometry at UC Berkeley (PI: Chung). Dr. Legge from the Department of Psychology at U. Minnesota will participate as a consultant. Two human subjects studies are planned. In Study 1 with 80 low vision subjects from four different categories of visual impairment, we will investigate the failure rate of a commercial gaze tracker (Aim 1), and will record mouse tracks, gaze tracks, and images from the subjects while performing a number of tasks using two modalities of screen magnification (Aim 2). In Study 2, with the same number of subjects, we will repeat the Study 1 experiment, but using a gaze-based controller trained from the data collected in Study 1, and individually tunable for best performance (Aim 3). In addition, we will experiment with an appearance-based gaze tracker that uses images from the screen camera, thereby removing the need for specialized gaze tracking hardware, as well as with a computer tablet form factor (Aim 4). We expect that reading speed and error rate using our gaze-based controller will be no worse than using mouse-based control. If successful, this study will show that the convenience of hands-free control offered by the proposed system comes at no additional cost in terms of individual performance at the considered tasks. ! ! Project Narrative People with low vision often use screen magnification software to read on a computer screen. Since a magnifier expands the screen content beyond the physical size of the screen (the “viewport”), it is necessary to move the content using the mouse so that the portion of interest falls within the viewport. This project will facilitate use of a screen magnifier by means of a new software system that relies on the user’s own gaze to control scrolling when reading with magnification. !",Gaze-contingent computer screen magnification control for people with low vision,10053172,R01EY030952,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Apple', 'Behavior Control', 'Benchmarking', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desktop Video', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magic', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Modality', 'Mus', 'Operating System', 'Optometry', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computer science', 'control trial', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gaze', 'human subject', 'interest', 'motor control', 'news', 'recurrent neural network', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'tool', 'web page', 'web site']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R01,2020,350753,0.0864886597924937
"Environmental Localization Mapping and Guidance for Visual Prosthesis Users Project Summary About 1.3 million Americans aged 40 and older are legally blind, a majority because of diseases with onset later in life, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Second Sight has developed the world's first FDA approved retinal implant, Argus II, intended to restore some functional vision for people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In this era of smart devices, generic navigation technology, such as GPS mapping apps for smartphones, can provide directions to help guide a blind user from point A to point B. However, these navigational aids do little to enable blind users to form an egocentric understanding of the surroundings, are not suited to navigation indoors, and do nothing to assist in avoiding obstacles to mobility. The Argus II, on the other hand, provides blind users with a limited visual representation of their surroundings that improves users' ability to orient themselves and traverse obstacles, yet lacks features for high-level navigation and semantic interpretation of the surroundings. The proposed research aims to address these limitations of the Argus II through a synergy of state-of-the-art stimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object recognition technologies. For the past three years, JHU/APL has collaborated with Second Sight to develop similar advanced vision-based capabilities for the Argus II, including capabilities for object recognition and obstacle detection by stereo vision. This proposal is driven by the hypothesis that navigation for users of retinal prosthetics can be greatly improved by incorporating SLAM and object recognition technology conveying environmental information via a retinal prosthesis and auditory feedback. SLAM enables the visual prosthesis system to construct a map of the user's environment and locate the user within that map. The system then provides object location and navigational cues via appropriate sensory modalities enabling the user to mentally form an egocentric map of the environment. We propose to develop and test a visual prosthesis system which 1) constructs a map of unfamiliar environments and localizes the user using SLAM technology 2) automatically identifies navigationally-relevant objects and landmarks using object recognition and 3) provides sensory feedback for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and object/landmark identification.

"Vision in Natural Tasks Summary/Abstract  In the context of natural behavior, humans make continuous sequences of sensory-motor decisions to satisfy current behavioral goals, and vision must provide the information needed to achieve those goals. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoor environments, taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements in these contexts. Currently we have only limited understanding of the constituent tasks in natural locomotion, or the requisite information, and the proposal attempts to specify these.  in the context of natural gait, the patterns of optic flow are unexpectedly complex, raising questions about its role. The patterns of motion on the retina during locomotion depend critically on both eye and body motion, and these in turn depend on behavioral goals. Our first Aim is therefore to comprehensively describe the statistics of retinal motion patterns in a variety of terrains and task contexts. We will measure binocular eye and body movements while walking in outdoor terrains of varying roughness, crossing a busy intersection, and making coffee. These contexts will induce different gaze patterns. We will provide a comprehensive description of the motion stimulus in natural locomotion and help separate out self-motion signals from externally generated motion. These data will allow a more precise specification of the response patterns in cortical motion sensitive areas. Because of the complexity of natural motion patterns, we will re-examine the influence of optic flow on walking direction in a virtual reality environment and test alternative explanations for the role of flow.  A central task in walking is foot placement, and we will focus on identifying the image properties that make a good foothold. Stereo, structure from motion, and spatial image structure are all likely contenders. We directly investigate the role of stereo in foothold selection by examining gait patterns in stereo-deficient subjects in terrains with varying degrees of roughness. Using a different strategy, we will attempt to predict gaze locations and footholds in rough terrain using convolution neural nets (CNN’s) to identify potential search templates for footholds in rough terrain. We will describe fixation patterns from crosswalk and sidewalk navigation and attempt to make inferences about their purpose, and use Modular Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MIRL) to predict direction decisions and decompose the behavior into sub-tasks.  The collection of integrated gaze, body kinematics, and scene images in a range of natural environments is innovative, as little comparable data exists The work will be strengthened by the investigation of stereo- deficient subjects for whom there is almost no integrated eye and body data. Since much of the work in robotics has no visual input at all this should help in development of visual guidance for robots and also help better define the necessary information for individuals with impaired vision. The data set will be made publicly available. Project Narrative  The central goal of this work is to understand vision in its natural context. This is very important information in order to devise suitable vision aids and rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual impairments, and it is becoming increasingly accessible because of developments in technology for monitoring eye and body movements. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoor environments, taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements in these contexts.

The data set will be made publicly available.",Vision in Natural Tasks,10004035,R01EY005729,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binocular Vision', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Coffee', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Pattern', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Retina', 'Rewards', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'To specify', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual impairment', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'foot', 'gaze', 'imaging properties', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'novel', 'optic flow', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'statistics', 'virtual reality environment', 'vision aid', 'vision development', 'vision rehabilitation', 'visual information']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2020,381743,0.010439408637126581
