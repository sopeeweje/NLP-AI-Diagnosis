"Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning Project Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals. Currently there are no proven effective therapies for treatment of advanced non-neovascular AMD, termed geographic atrophy (GA). Earlier intervention may be preferable, but this would require identification of those individuals with the highest risk for progression to atrophy. Over the last two decades, various studies including ours have identified several optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based factors that appear to associate with a higher risk for AMD progression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important risk factors, yielding a better prediction of AMD progression risk than current subjectively specified features. In this proposal, we will first develop an AI- based system to automatically identify the “subjectively-specified” high risk factors based on individual spectral domain (SD) OCT 2D scans, and to automatically segment GA (the end-stage outcome variable of AMD) in OCT 2D en face maps. Subsequently, as a proof-of-concept study of our hypothesis, we will apply an AI-based “reverse learning” approach to objectively learn and identify AMD high risk factors in longitudinal OCT data. To achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate an AI approach to classify individual OCT 2D scans as containing or not containing the pre-specified risk factor(s). In our previous work, we manually identified the presence or absence of the pre-specific high-risk factors and assigned to a risk score based on the entire OCT volume. Such approach was time consuming and not precise. In this proposal, an AI algorithm will be applied to detect the high risk factors from individual OCT scans. Hence, the precision of the scoring system can be greatly enhanced with high computational complexity. Aim 2: Develop and validate an AI approach to segment GA lesions from 2D OCT en face maps. For the OCT volumes having atrophy, we will perform the GA segmentation from the choroidal hypertransmission-resulted en face map using the multi-scale CNNs. Aim 3: Develop and validate an AI “reverse learning” approach to objectively identify the high risk factors using longitudinal OCT data. The “reverse learning” will be based on the multiple CNNs, followed by de- convolutional networks to identify the high risk factors objectively. Our previous scoring system will possibly be refined and optimized by the potential inclusion (or substitution) of novel risk factors derived from our objective AI approaches. The work in this proposal will be performed retrospectively in SD-OCT images from the image data pool that the multi-PI Sadda has aggregated over years as the director of the Doheny image reading center. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals and it may be preferable to intervene at an earlier stage in the disease process. We propose to use artificial intelligence techniques to automatically and objectively identify and quantify end-stage atrophy as well to identify the features on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which are associated with a higher risk for progression to late atrophic AMD. This research should have implications for clinical practice in the staging and monitoring of AMD patients, as well as facilitating new therapeutic trials for AMD.",Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning,9807978,R21EY030619,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Elderly', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'research study']",NEI,DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE,R21,2019,235500,-0.03469281663758577
"AmplideX DeepNet, a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space Project Summary  An extensible analysis platform will be developed to accurately perform the automated genotyping of PCR/capillary electrophoresis (CE) traces for multiple disease-associated short tandem repeater (STR) assays. This study will evaluate the feasibility of developing generalizable and adaptive molecular analysis models, and will ultimately establish a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space.  Advanced machine learning strategies will be applied to interpret genotypes of inherited disorders caused by genetically unstable STR DNA sequences. STRs have traditionally been difficult to investigate due to their length (on the order of kilobases) and low sequence complexity, which elude detection by traditional and next- generation sequencing technologies. However, advances in PCR/CE technology have enabled the amplification and fragment sizing of STR DNA fragments, advancing clinical research and diagnostic test development for several neurodegenerative disorders, such as fragile X syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite these advances, the analysis of PCR/CE data from assays targeting STRs remains a manual, burdensome, and subjective process. There is a clear need to create a system that can scale with the development of new assays, and the proposed approach utilizes modern breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to fulfill that need.  This method will leverage recent advances in representation learning to establish a generalized and adaptive framework for automated PCR/CE annotation that can scale to new assays and improve automatically with the inclusion of new data. The project will benefit from Asuragen’s experience in optimizing repeat-primed chemistries to develop and commercialize multiple high performance assays including the AmplideX PCR/CE FMR1 kit. Importantly, the proposed modeling strategy will borrow-strength across multiple established PCR/CE assays and generalize to future PCR/CE assays for novel STR disease associated biomarkers. This system will be paramount to enabling a continuous learning platform wherein computationally-assisted annotation of PCR/CE assays can be continuously improved and integrated in to clinical research tools and diagnostics. Project Narrative  We are developing AmplideX DeepNet, an artificial intelligence-based analysis system that can accurately perform computationally-assisted analysis of molecular diagnostic assays. The proposed system will build upon recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to allow it to easily adapt to new assays and to continue to improve. The system will be applied to assays for several disorders, including fragile X syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myotonic dystrophy, and Huntington’s disease, and will provide a number of benefits over current analysis methods by reducing turn-around time for assay results and assuring reproducible reporting between operators and labs.","AmplideX DeepNet, a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space",9678895,R43GM128498,"['Alleles', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'C9ORF72', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 repeat', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Huntington Disease', 'Interruption', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Myotonic Dystrophy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'analysis pipeline', 'analytical tool', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'experience', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'heuristics', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'learning progression', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'research and development', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,"ASURAGEN, INC.",R43,2019,269217,-8.587522936916654e-05
"Prediction of seizure lateralization and postoperative outcome through the use of deep learning applied to multi-site MRI/DTI data:  An ENIGMA-Epilepsy study ABSTRACT  Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness that affects 65 million people worldwide. Approximately one-third of patients affected do not respond to antiepileptic drug therapy and require a thorough diagnostic work-up. Structural neuroimaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy, identifying visible lesions in many patients that often coincide with the seizure focus. However, 20- 40% of patients have normal-appearing MRIs and this number appears to be growing. As a result, there is increased interest in identifying subtle gray and white matter network changes on non-invasive, quantitative MRI, including structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), that can help to delineate the epileptogenic network. Unfortunately, methods for selecting optimal features from sMRI/DTI data in patients with epilepsy that can address these clinical challenges have not been developed. There are at least two major barriers that have limited progress in this field. First, sample sizes have been insufficient to develop reliable classification algorithms in patients with focal epilepsy that lead to reproducible findings. The high cost of data collection - few studies scan more than 50-60 patients - has led to underpowered studies whose findings often fail to replicate and cannot adequately model confounds. Second, high computational demands have previously limited the feasibility of using sophisticated, feature-selection (i.e., Machine Learning; ML) algorithms in clinical settings.  A new, large-scale data initiative (i.e., ENIGMA-epilepsy) acquired from 24 sites world-wide is now lifting these barriers and allowing for the development and validation of innovative data-driven approaches aimed at optimizing the use of MRI data in the evaluation of epilepsy. In this grant, we will leverage data collected through ENIGMA-Epilepsy—a new, cost-effective, innovative global approach that unblocks the power logjam by merging resources, data, capital infrastructure and talents of leading epilepsy centers from 14 countries across the world (2,149 patient and 1,727 healthy control MRI/DTI datasets). We will also leverage new developments in ML (i.e., deep learning) and network-based modeling (i.e., connectome- based approaches) and test whether these novel approaches improve upon classification accuracy relative to simpler, user-driven models. Our primary aim will be to test the ability of our deep learning approach (i.e., dense neural networks) to lateralize the seizure focus. In an exploratory aim, we will test the ability of our model to predict post-operative seizure outcomes. ENIGMA's harmonized approach will allow us to test our approach in over 24 datasets, diverse in age, ethnicity, age of onset, epilepsy duration, and surgical outcomes.  This R-21 application addresses NIH's call for more reproducible studies by introducing a highly- powered design, and is directly aligned with NINDS's 2014 Epilepsy Benchmarks, which encourage the identification of biomarkers for assessing or predicting treatment response in patients with epilepsy. NARRATIVE Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness, affecting 65 million people worldwide. In this project, we will leverage the ENIGMA-Epilepsy infrastructure to address how advanced, non-invasive neuroimaging can be used to develop algorithms for (1) lateralizing the seizure focus and (2) predicting favorable versus unfavorable surgical outcomes. The research will be accomplished by applying novel machine learning algorithms to clinical and imaging data on an exceptionally large cohort of patients with epilepsy and healthy controls, providing unprecedented power to tackle critical diagnostic and treatment-related questions in epilepsy.",Prediction of seizure lateralization and postoperative outcome through the use of deep learning applied to multi-site MRI/DTI data:  An ENIGMA-Epilepsy study,9751025,R21NS107739,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Capital', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Lifting', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'brain abnormalities', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hands-on learning', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized approach', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'white matter']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2019,444315,-0.01934717668900437
"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its risk factors of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent in the United States. To better understand the mechanism between adiposity-obesity-related CKD mechanism, the proposed research will implement machine learning algorithms, and identify distinct patient subgroups and discover novel CKD biomarkers, using the clinical and high-dimensional metabolomics data from a diverse cohort of CKD patients. The findings of our study hold promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD, and facilitate personalized disease management.",Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease,9834239,F31DK122683,"['Active Learning', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome Assessment', 'PTH gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Troponin T', 'Tryptophan', 'United States', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'patient subsets', 'personalized management', 'population based', 'preservation', 'random forest', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted biomarker', 'tool']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2019,45016,-0.023072632578876585
"2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE 2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A 1.5-day symposium, StoneLab will be held December 6-7, 2019 at AUA Headquarters in Linthicum, Maryland, near BWI Airport. The novel StoneLab Symposium will be a meeting where kidney stone researchers can come together with experts in biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, medical device design and development. We plan to encourage researchers to “think outside the box” in the search for advances in kidney stone treatment. The target audience for this meeting includes: urologists, nephrologists, basic scientists, early-career investigators, residents, research fellows, and project management members of urology research teams in the area of nephrolithiasis and related technology development. It is essential that the urology community, and especially trainees, early-career physician- scientists, and researchers be provided with accessible opportunities to gain understanding of new knowledge and recent advances in not only their own fields, but in related fields that they may not otherwise be aware of, and leverage this for new research frameworks that can help improve the treatment of kidney stone disease. A critical aspect of the StoneLab Sympoisum is the delivery of talks from outside the normal realm of kidney stone research by leading basic scientists, followed by discussions led by kidney stone researchers and surgeons. The intent of these discussions is to spur the development of collaborations and the generation of new ideas and avenues for exploration. Another goal of the meeting is to help identify future funding needs and growth areas for kidney stone research. The R13 support requested in this application will encourage early investigators to participate in the workshop and stimulate their development as researchers and surgeon- scientists. This symposium will have a major impact by bringing together premier kidney stone researchers, along with experts in nephrology, biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, and medical device design and development, to explore solutions for the most pressing translational science issues facing kidney stone researchers today. The Principal Investigator (PI), Carolyn J.M. Best, PhD, is AUA Director of Research. The Program Planning Committee consists of a diverse multidisciplinary team of distinguished scientists and urologists, most of whom also serve in leadership roles of several AUA-affiliated subspecialty societies: Khurshid Ghani, MD, MS (Chair); Ben H. Chew, MD, MSc (Co-Chair); Thomas Chi, MD; Benjamin Canales, MD, MPH; Gary Curhan, MD, ScD; Amy Krambeck, MD; Dirk Lange, PhD; Manoj Monga, MD, FACS; Kristina Penniston, PhD,RD; and Aria Olumi, MD (ex-officio). 2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE  PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT This application seeks support to enable the American Urological Association (AUA) to invite early-career investigators (and late-stage trainees) to participate in a novel interdisciplinary symposium where premier kidney stone researchers, along with experts in nephrology, can come together with experts in biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, and medical device design and development with the aim of “thinking outside the box” in the search for advances in kidney stone treatment.

"Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models Project abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. A critical gap in the treatment of PD patients is that there is no clinically adopted method to predict an individual's progression rate. A predictor would enable the enrichment of disease modifying drug trials with fast progressors likely to show changes in the short duration of a clinical trial and enable a more informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops a composite biomarker of progression rate using the connectivity information provided by resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and deep learning. Deep learning (DL) is well suited to form predictive models because it learns both an optimal hierarchy of features and how to combine them for accurate prediction. In rs-fMRI the blood-oxygen level dependent signal can be analyzed to infer connectivity throughout the brain. Traditionally, connectivity has been computed as the correlation between average regional activation time courses. However correlation based connectivity is prone to inferring spurious connections due to its inability to distinguish indirect from direct connectivity and inability to distinguish bidirectional from unidirectional connectivity. A causal connectivity approach can discern these differences and thereby provide a more faithful characterization of the true neurobiological connectivity. The existing literature suggests connectivity, particularly causal connectivity, from rs-fMRI can inform the estimation of PD progression, but the attempt to predict progression rate with causal connectivity in a DL model is unique to this project.  This research develops several distinct approaches for building a progression rate predictor and apply them to three datasets including: the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) dataset, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's prospective imaging extension to the NINDS PBDP. In these studies, individual progression rates have been tracked over multiple years using multiple clinical measures. First, causal and correlative measures will be generated regionally and used with a DL model to create a baseline predictor of progression rate. Second, voxel- level causal measures will be generated as the increased granularity is expected to improve prediction accuracy. Third, since purely data-driven DL methods can be sensitive to dataset limitations, such as insufficient subjects and noise, these limitations will be addressed by developing a new structural connectivity regularization approach that constrains causal connectivity by the subject's own diffusion MRI. This regularization method will be general and likely applicable for building predictors for other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. This proposal will yield both DL models for predicting progression rate and a novel method to calculate constrained causal connectivity. All predictive models, composite neuroimaging biomarkers of progression rate and software will be publicly disseminated for ready incorporation by the scientific and clinical communities. Project narrative Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and this debilitating and incurable disease has no known cure. A cure for PD remains elusive due to the lack of clinically adopted predictors of progression rate, which if constructed would 1) hasten the discovery of disease modifying drugs by enriching clinical trials with fast progressors who likely will show changes over the trial, 2) allow for stratification of patients by progression rate in those trials, and 3) enable an informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops and validates distinct approaches to predict PD progression rate, identifies new biomarkers of progression rate, and yields a generalizable framework for constraining causal measures from fMRI with the subject's own structural connectivity that is readily repurposable for other neurological disorders with connectivity changes such as stroke and Alzheimer's.",Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models,9909889,F31NS115348,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Florida', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'tractography']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2019,34014,-0.07541229686196387
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not.

"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9695208,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,335803,0.008294227571945104
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing.

"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,9758579,F31AI133871,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Anaplasmosis', 'Area', 'Award', 'Babesia microti', 'Babesiosis', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bite', 'Black-legged Tick', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Characteristics', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological Change', 'Ecology', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Entomology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'New York', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Tick-Borne Infections', 'Ticks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'anthropogenesis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cost effective', 'decision tree learning', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'environmental change', 'geographic population', 'granulocyte', 'human disease', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'learning strategy', 'model design', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'regression trees', 'spatial temporal variation', 'statistics', 'tick-borne pathogen', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2019,45016,-0.021269956958826587
"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,9819321,R01EY013178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Pathology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Width', 'advanced disease', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'density', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'invention', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'macula', 'mathematical methods', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'ocular imaging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,715489,-0.009147580840815706
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9697824,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neural network', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,564228,-0.010306356613320033
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,9787546,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,312939,0.0016412426701367814
"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,9714883,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,666637,-0.012148924501415788
"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9818000,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,489349,-0.018603946222234536
"Automatic analysis of 3D skin images for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) severity assessment Project Summary More than 20,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (including bone marrow transplants) are performed in the U.S. each year to cure a range of diseases ranging from leukemias to sickle cell anemia to autoimmune deficiencies in children. Unfortunately, most long-term non-relapse survivors will die of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which remains a disease of steadily increasing incidence and profound unmet need. A fundamental barrier in cGVHD management and research is a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and reproducible measures of disease severity and progression. Skin is the most commonly affected organ in cGVHD and automated techniques capable of measuring precisely the surface area of involved skin in photographs may provide the tools necessary for effectively evaluating patient progress. We propose to (1) create the data set necessary to develop machine learning-based methods for the automatic analysis of cGVHD images, and (2) implement and evaluate these methods. Project Narrative  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a lethal disease that affects most long-term hematopoietic stem cell transplant (including bone marrow transplants) recipients. Skin images are used to assess disease severity and progression but the technology required to quantitatively and reproducibly analyze these images is lacking.

"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users. Public Health Relevance: Since the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9750722,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,527585,0.005533603013267017
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9640524,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,462750,-0.013221238726901294
"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9916110,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2019,274577,-0.008567467335676884
"Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and lack of effective therapies for multi-drug resistant organisms, the development of new tools or models which risk-stratify patients for colonization and infection by AR bacteria is of paramount importance, particularly in high-risk populations. The significance of the gut microbiome in mediating colonization resistance against drug resistant pathogens as well as the role of microbiota-depleting antibiotics in the development of AR infections is being increasingly appreciated. However, there is currently a deficiency of methods integrating microbiome and antibiotic factors into AR- predictive algorithms. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the factors driving the epidemiology of AR-colonization and infection by incorporating metagenomic and antibiotic administration data of a well-defined clinical cohort. In this proposal, we focus on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (from whom we have already collected extensive longitudinal stool samples and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing) because of the high rates of AR pathogen colonization and severe risk for infection. The overarching hypothesis that will be tested is that the baseline presence of a limited number of key bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical for the risk of colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen when combined with the administration of specific antimicrobials. We will begin our research by comprehensively determining the epidemiology of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection in our cohort via culture based stool sample analyses and clinical chart review, respectively. Using shotgun metagenomics, we will establish whether the baseline intestinal microbiome species and resistome characteristics are associated with the acquisition of AR pathogens colonizing or causing infection. Similarly, we will ascertain the relationship between antimicrobial exposure, microbiome disruption, and subsequent AR emergence. The data from these studies will be integrated into Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models to improve the prediction of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection outcomes. The proposed career development award, which utilizes the expertise of a superlative mentorship team and a uniquely designed research and training plan, will enable me the opportunity to build upon my current expertise in microbiology, genomics, and molecular epidemiology by adding advanced training in shotgun metagenomic analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistical modeling. Moreover, the numerous resources and support provided by my institution and mentoring team will ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator as well as establish a strong foundation for my long-term goals of understanding and mitigating the impact of antimicrobial resistance in human health via integration of multiple –omics platforms and provision of personalized genomic-based medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant (AR) infections are one of the most serious public health threats and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The proposed research will use a combination of culture-based techniques and high-throughput approaches to determine the epidemiology of colonization and infectious events by AR-pathogens, characterize the gut microbiome, and mine clinical data of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy in order to identify microbial species, antibiotic resistance genes, patient features, and antibiotic administration factors that affect the risk for colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit metagenomics as an epidemiological tool for understanding susceptibility to AR outcomes and to build predictive risk models which can be potentially incorporated into prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate AR infection events in high-risk patients.",Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics,9717421,K01AI143881,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal microbes', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'effective therapy', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'leukemia', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multiple omics', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'resistance gene', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2019,110387,0.0085422349937455
"Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future infection Project Summary / Abstract Background: Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. This goal will be achieved in many countries, but some regions in Ethiopia maintain persistently high levels of infection despite >10 years of intensive control activities. A small proportion of the population likely harbors the majority of trachoma infections, with foci of infection (“hotspots”) at or below the village scale; the operational challenge is accurately predicting where they are with existing data. Advances in machine learning and spatial data science have demonstrated marked improvements in the spatial resolution of predictions for diseases like malaria. Among available biomarkers of trachoma, IgG antibody responses in children could enable more accurate predictions because they integrate exposure over time and reflect recent transmission. Aims: The principal aims of this study are to evaluate whether antibody measurements can identify stable hotspots of trachoma infection, and whether a novel machine learning approach can accurately predict village- level trachoma infection forward in time (up to 3 years). We hypothesize that infection will be concentrated in the population and that hotspots of infection will be at the village level. We further hypothesize that antibody measurements in young children will provide a stable source of information about trachoma transmission that will enable us to accurately predict villages with high levels of future C. trachomatis infection. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we will draw on measurements from a well characterized population across 40 villages enrolled in a NIH-funded cluster randomized trial in Ethiopia’s Amhara Region (U10-EY023939). The three-year trial is designed to measure the effect of improved water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) on trachoma infection in the absence of azithromycin treatment. The trial has collected clinical and biomarker measurements from approximately 2,400 children ages 0-9 years at enrollment and in annual visits over 3 years. We will characterize the spatial scale of transmission using the !-statistic, which equals the relative risk of infection within different distances of cases. We will use a permutation-based, spatial scan statistic to identify hotspots using IgG antibody and PCR measures in each year, and will determine if they are stable over time. Using geospatial ensemble machine learning, we will predict trachoma seroprevalence as a function of remotely sensed, geospatial information and limited enrollment characteristics. We will rank order villages by predicted seroprevalence, and will assess the proportion of PCR C. trachomatis infections in top-ranked villages 1, 2, and 3 years later. We will repeat the analysis using predicted clinical symptoms as a comparator. The development of methods to make accurate, fine-scale predictions of future C. trachomatis infection will lay the groundwork for a future adaptive randomized trial that preferentially allocates more intensive intervention to villages predicted at enrollment to have high future levels of infection. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Trachoma control programs target and monitor activities at the level of districts, but it is likely that infection hotspots are concentrated at much smaller scales and could be missed in district-level averages. We propose to combine antibody-based measures of exposure with state-of-the-art machine learning to develop predictions of trachoma infection at the scale of individual villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which would represent a substantial increase in the resolution of information available to guide control and monitoring efforts.",Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future infection,9805550,R03AI147128,"['Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Azithromycin', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Cholera', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethiopia', 'Eye Infections', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handwashing', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hygiene', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relative Risks', 'Resolution', 'Sanitation', 'Scanning', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'remote sensing', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R03,2019,1299,-0.0031930878133724925
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,9721392,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2019,226659,-0.005792766659945285
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,9819449,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,754111,-0.006630425738046165
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics.

"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ampicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Fluids', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gentamicins', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Uropathogen', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'digital', 'genetic analysis', 'imaging capabilities', 'instrument', 'melting', 'microbial', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'success']",NIAID,"COMBINATI, INC.",R41,2019,224658,0.0017491444106507374
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems.

"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community.

In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community. Project Narrative Viruses are abundant in many environments and are important to public health. New statistical and computational tools will be developed for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples and for the prediction of virus-host interactions. These tools will be used to analyze microbial data sets related to liver cirrhosis and travelers’ diarrhea as well as marine metagenomics data sets from various geographic locations and time series.",Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications,9668156,R01GM120624,"['Affect', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Body Water', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Measures', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Network-based', 'Oceans', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Soil', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traveler&apos', 's diarrhea', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gut metagenome', 'human disease', 'interest', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'particle', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,381513,0.0036453300966786456
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9742524,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'supervised learning', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,659674,-0.005099034554075682
"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9701928,R21AI135641,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Helminths', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intestinal parasite', 'Intestines', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Source', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'enteric infection', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'helminth infection', 'infection risk', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'prevent']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,183750,-0.004984000900220214
"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache ABSTRACT There is currently no recognized way of accurately predicting who will recover from post-traumatic headache (PTH) during the acute phase following concussion and who will go on to develop persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH), a condition that is difficult to treat effectively. Clinical experience with treating secondary headaches suggests that treatment is most effective when initiated early after headache onset, before headache patterns become persistent. So, why don't clinicians treat all patients with PTH acutely following concussion? Although it is likely to be beneficial to treat those patients who are at high risk for PPTH as early as possible, medication side effects and toxicities make it potentially harmful to administer unnecessary medication to those patients who would recover on their own without treatment. The inability to identify which concussed patients with acute PTH are at high risk for PTH persistence leaves clinicians without the knowledge needed to make informed decisions regarding how aggressive to manage patients with acute PTH. Study Goal: to develop a prognostic biomarker signature for PPTH using clinical data as well as structural and functional brain neuroimaging and to assess the predictive accuracy of an ensemble biomarker signature for the early identification of patients at high risk for PTH persistence. The accurate prediction of individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence would allow clinicians to recommend early and more aggressive management with the intention of preventing PTH persistence. A predictive model for PPTH could also guide clinical trials that will test the utility of innovative therapies to prevent PPTH by allowing for enrichment of the subject cohort with patients at high risk of PPTH. R61 Phase: During the R61 phase this study will develop brain imaging and clinical feature prognostic biomarker signatures for PPTH using machine-learning algorithms. The imaging and clinical biomarker signatures will be developed by laboratories that will first work in-parallel, and then the laboratories will combine the neuroimaging and clinical biomarkers using an ensemble approach. Results of this study will determine important clinical factors (e.g. demographics, medical history, brain injury characteristics, headache characteristics, speech patterns) and brain imaging markers (e.g. regional volumes, cortical thickness, white matter tract integrity, perfusion, functional connectivity) for predicting PTH persistence Additionally, the predictive weight of specific clinical factors and neuroimaging features for characterizing patients who are at higher risk for developing PPTH will be determined. R33 Phase: Once the predictive weights of clinical factors and neuroimaging features are determined, the clinical testing battery and neuroimaging sequences can be pruned down and optimized to include only those that have high predictive power for PPTH. The scanning sequences used in this study are commonly available MRI sequences, making their use feasible across healthcare centers. This optimized and shortened testing sequence can be translated into clinical practice and integrated into PTH clinical trials for early identification of those individuals who are at high risk for PTH persistence.   Project Narrative: Currently, there are no adequate methods to predict whether an individual with post-traumatic headache (PTH) will have resolution of headaches during the acute phase or will have persistence of PTH (PPTH). The goal of this study is to identify a prognostic biomarker signature that will accurately predict the persistence of PTH using clinical data and structural and functional brain neuroimaging data collected in the semi-acute post-concussion phase. The ability to predict who will develop PPTH would help clinicians determine how aggressively to manage patients with PTH during the acute phase and would allow for optimizing enrollment into PTH clinical trials by preferentially enrolling individuals who are likely to have PTH persistence.  ",Biomarker Signature to Predict the Persistence of Post-Traumatic Headache,9829475,R61NS113315,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Headache', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Headaches', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'demographics', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'side effect', 'white matter']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R61,2019,3152333,-0.014382879430563697
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9739188,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,506426,-0.004617398112244158
"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award. Narrative We will refine the operations of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford in coordination with other Phase II sites of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to diagnose the undiagnosed and facilitate a transition to sustainability. Our Center will bring Stanford’s long history in technology development, genomic data analysis, stem cell biology, and translational science to the team-based diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed disease.

"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9663961,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,127308,0.015946863025132436
"Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn Abstract Worldwide, infectious disease remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and results in one million newborn deaths each year. Rapid and precise profiling of pathogens is the key to targeted and effective clinical management of infectious disease. However, current diagnostic methods are slow, limited in breadth of detection, and often unreliable. Further, they have limited ability to detect polymicrobial infection and suffer from poor specificity due to an inability to distinguish clinically relevant from non-pathogenic DNA. Genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (HRM) provides a simple, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. HRM generates sequence specific melt curves in a closed-tube reaction as PCR-amplified DNA fragments are heated and disassociate. Our team has advanced this technology through the proof-of-concept stage, demonstrating that a novel digital PCR format for HRM can achieve accurate universal genotyping and quantification of DNA targets in under 3 hours. DNA sequences present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified using the principles of microfluidic sample partitioning and machine learning to enable sensitive specific polymicrobial detection of all the targets present in the DNA mixture. However, for clinical integration, critical innovations are needed. This includes optimization of our upstream processing steps to selectively capture, load, and detect DNA sequences from only viable pathogen cells from a small-volume (≤ 1mL) neonatal blood sample. Further, methods to establish linkages between pathogen identity and antibiotic resistance are needed at the single cell level to fully characterize and accurately quantitate the resistance profile of the pathogen population for precise targeted treatment. In phase I of this proposal, we will focus on refining sample preparation steps to (1) maximize our sensitivity and (2) enable co-localization of resistance markers with identified microbes. We hypothesize that we can efficiently capture pathogen load from blood, reducing interference from human cell contents and enable single cell analysis and quantitation of only viable pathogens while linking species identification and resistance. The processes and tests developed in this proposal will provide: 1) high negative predictive value to rule out bloodstream infection; and 2) specific identification and quantitation of pathogens along with co-localization of relevant antibiotic resistance genes for the targeted treatment of true infections while limiting influence from contaminants or environmental microbes of no clinical significance. In Phase II, the system will be developed to its beta form for testing in a clinical environment. Melio’s goal is to ultimately deliver a low-cost, small-footprint benchtop device compatible with the clinical workflow. Narrative We propose the development of a culture-independent molecular diagnostic test that will enable the rapid and precise detection of infections in newborns. This test uniquely combines the cutting-edge technologies of machine learning, microfluidic partitioning of samples for digital interrogation, and High-Resolution Melting of nucleic acids to create unique pathogen fingerprints for all high-risk bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and associated resistance marker(s) present in small-volume blood samples in under 3 hours. Such a timely and accurate test is needed for effective antimicrobial therapy in newborns suspected of infection to reduce antibiotic use in non-infected patients while aggressively treating those in need with narrow spectrum antibiotics targeted towards the offending pathogens.",Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn,9778646,R43AI145567,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Asses', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Custom', 'Cytolysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA amplification', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidics', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory distress', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'microbiome research', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'plasmid DNA', 'premature', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'single cell analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,MELIOLABS INC.,R43,2019,299734,0.0023084252550618603
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,9789907,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'Zika Virus', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computational platform', 'computer infrastructure', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'economic determinant', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector control', 'vector-borne']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,366616,0.001948107650611562
"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,9846955,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2019,621318,0.0028242140246295005
"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9638561,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human microbiota', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,364865,-0.004550925314048489
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,-0.010683928460537997
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9988737,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,544562,-0.020971502181199572
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,9776969,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,149824,-0.04035065255132883
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9668180,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,166104,-0.01273610393528739
"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration. These features are not well recapitulated by the current biomarkers in use in the clinic, majority of them are DNA based mutation assays. RNA expression patterns have been described by various investigators and may more fully recapitulate tumor biology. The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay. By utilizing an assay developed to classify CRC by its tumor biology, we anticipate development of an enduring tool that will be of greater use than traditional fit-for-purpose tests.   NARRATIVE The molecular characteristics of colon cancer can be described by RNA-based expression, and a consensus classification method has been developed.

"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9735326,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,396887,-0.010074033844702492
"Mobile-phone integrated rapid diagnostic tests to improve antibiotic stewardship PROJECT SUMMARY  An estimated 1.4 billion antibiotic prescriptions were filled in the US from 2000-2010. Despite a national antibiotic education campaign, approximately 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result of the over-prescription of antibiotics, there is a current and pressing public health need for improved antibiotic stewardship. Compounding this problem are new modalities of healthcare like telemedicine that, while meeting patient demand for convenience, have been shown to have higher antibiotic prescription rates. As a result, there is a pressing need for a tool that these remote providers can use to distinguish between bacterial infections, where antibiotics can be effective, and viral infections where antibiotics are unneeded.  In this research, we propose the development of Barcode Embedded Rapid Diagnostics (BERDs) as a point-of-care test to measure a host biomarker signature in response to an infection in blood. These tests have novel spatial patterning of reagents that allows them to automatically and quantitatively be analyzed by a mobile phone application. Once the biomarkers have been analyzed on the test, a clinical decision support engine developed in this proposal will provide a confident diagnosis.  We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of biomedical engineering, point-of-care device, and software development expertise through PragmaDx, Inc., and biomarker assay development in the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: optimize manufacturing conditions of BERDs, develop and evaluate a machine learning clinical decision support engine, and rigorously compare the performance of BERDs to standard clinical laboratory methods using de-identified patient specimens.  A successful outcome of this Phase I STTR will be the development of a diagnostic test and clinical decision support engine that is capable of measuring multiple biomarkers in blood to differentiate the etiology of an infection at the point-of-care, with accuracy comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays. Upon completion of this effective demonstration, the platform will be ready for a large-scale clinical evaluation that will be the subject of a Phase II application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  An estimated 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result, antibiotic resistance has developed into a major public health concern.

"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",9791705,P01DK043881,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2019,1619137,-0.021362984218069526
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9645854,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2019,169440,-0.00025623861666675406
"Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NCI’s mission to support research into the diagnosis of cancer.",Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection,9625104,R01CA215574,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'American', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Adenoma', 'Colonic Diseases', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'New England', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resected', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Somatic Cell', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer screening', 'colon carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'fecal microbiome', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'screening', 'stool sample', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,131521,-0.004197316771438243
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9700030,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric infection', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,26919,-0.013746546838381692
"Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disabling condition for 2.5 million Americans associated with  prolonged fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and sleep disturbances. The cause of CFS remains  unknown, and there are currently no available diagnostic tests to confirm disease. However, a  substantial number of immune features have been measured in CFS. Given this problem, the objective  of this project is to identify a panel of distinct antibody epitopes that can be used to identify  cases of CFS using a blood test. In Aim 1, we will apply serum epitope repertoire analysis to  determine the antibody epitope repertoires within a cohort of 200 CFS patients and 175  controls. Antibody epitopes occurring in CFS sera, and not controls will be identified   using bioinformatics methods. A panel of motifs will be downselected using machine  learning to optimize sensitivity and specificity within the discovery set. The performance of  the panel will be measured in an independent set of specimens to determine sensitivity and  specificity, and identify potential CFS subgroups. We will determine whether individual  markers, or sets of markers, correlate with various clinical features of CFS. Infections with a variety of pathogens have been associated with the development of fatigue lasting  one year or longer, and post-infection fatigue patients typically meet clinical criteria for CFS.  Given the potential for heterogeneous infectious etiology, we hypothesize that CFS patients may  exhibit increased rates of seropositivity for a broad set of infectious agents associated with  fatigue. Using serum epitope repertoire analysis, we will determine whether IgG seropositivity for  20 infections (as a group) differs between CFS patients and controls. The proposed project may  identify antibody biomarkers suitable for development of diagnostic immunoassay for CFS, and may  elucidate whether prior or ongoing infections are associated with CFS. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalitis (ME), is a disabling condition  affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States. The cause of CFS  remains unknown, and there are no objective laboratory diagnostic tests to  confirm disease. Consequently, diagnosis of CFS remains exceptionally difficult, requiring the  exclusion of a wide variety fatiguing illnesses. This project aims to apply advanced molecular  discovery tools and computation to identify patterns of circulating antibodies that can be   used to diagnose and monitor CFS patients using a blood test. This project also holds the  potential to associate prior infections with the development of CFS.",Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome,9778480,R43AI145696,"['Academy', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Caregivers', 'Cell physiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cholinergic Receptors', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coxiella', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Fever Chills', 'Gene Expression', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscarinics', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Organism', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Seroprevalences', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Sore Throat', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'United States', 'acute infection', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'flu', 'immune activation', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'seropositive', 'sleep abnormalities', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAID,"SERIMMUNE, INC.",R43,2019,224975,0.007354769408251352
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9678366,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2019,602448,0.007828812497603553
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess greater accuracy to identify fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic disease and provide meaningful clinical information to health- care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases,9640388,R44AI129147,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Europe', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hematology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mixed Connective Tissue Disease', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Myalgia', 'Neuraxis', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'bone erosion', 'care providers', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'human disease', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'phase 1 study', 'rheumatologist', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,496653,0.021783632065781402
"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9697702,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'convolutional neural network', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response', 'supervised learning']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2019,223354,-0.01617951345038132
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant.

"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9613245,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,352125,0.010932393664546833
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9672582,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'tomography', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170639,-0.022787176263500592
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9694287,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,340259,-0.0019006529831322708
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes.

"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9606448,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,342009,-0.009506073327171165
"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,9781704,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,254179,0.012563034716908231
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response.

"The CRIT-ICU Biomarker Panel for Stratification of Mortality Risk in ARDS Patients PROJECT SUMMARY: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that annually afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. Substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity within ARDS phenotypes has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to reduce mortality. All therapies currently employed in ARDS management are ge- neric. The critical care community suffers from a lack of tools that allow identification of ARDS sub-phenotypes and individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. Recently, the hyperinflammatory and low inflammatory ARDS sub-phenotypes were identified that markedly differ in natural histories, clinical and biological character- istics, biomarker profiles, responses to positive end-expiratory pressure, ventilator- and organ failure-free days and mortality. ARDS severity (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), the severity of renal or hepatic failure, or the extent of leukocy- tosis failed to distinguish the two phenotypes. As the mortality of the hyperinflammatory phenotype is 3-5 times greater than low inflammatory phenotype, this Phase I STTR will leverage substantial complementary expertise to: i) establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that stratifies subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes; and ii) develop a quantitative platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon patient entry into the ER or ICU. Our preliminary biomarker data are strong and include 11 ARDS-relevant plasma biomarkers in >250 well-phenotyped ARDS subjects and 70 controls. The targeted biomarkers include cytokine-chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b, IL-RA), dual-functioning cytozymes i.e. cy- tokine/intracellular enzymes (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, NAMPT), vascular injury markers (VEGF- A, S1PR3, angiopoietin 2), and the advanced glycosylation end product pathway (HMGB1, soluble RAGE). Spe- cific Aim #1 will apply standard biostatistical approaches as well as novel neural network artificial intelligence analysis of this existing dataset to identify an optimal plasma-derived CRIT-ICU Panel which predicts ICU mor- tality in patients with sepsis or trauma who are at risk for development of respiratory failure and ARDS. Specific Aim #2 will develop an optimized and highly standardized Predictive Platform for the CRIT-ICU biomarkers iden- tified to be used in the clinical care setting. Finally, Specific Aim #3 will conduct retrospective validation studies of the optimized CRIT-ICU Panel in biobanked samples from 2 large cohorts: an emergency room-ARDS cohort (PETAL Clinical Network, n=800) and a Spanish sepsis-ARDS cohort (n=200). We speculate that unique exper- tise within Aqualung Therapeutics Corp., PAI Life Sciences Inc., InBios International Inc. and the University of Arizona Health Sciences will drive future prospective validation of the CRIT-ICU Panel in patients at risk for ARDS (Phase II STTR) and lead to development of a true Point of Care test to accelerate clinical trial stratification strategies, and development of innovative ARDS therapeutics to reduce mortality in this devastating syndrome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide each year (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%.

"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection.

"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point. Our collaborative databases, multivariate analyses and innovative antibody optimization strategies will establish platforms for discovery and delivery of much-needed treatments against these and other infectious diseases.",Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats,9676860,U19AI142790,"['Address', 'Alphavirus', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Arenavirus', 'Arthritogenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease', 'Ebola virus', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Filovirus', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Lassa virus', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Monoclonal Antibody Therapy', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primate Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'biodefense', 'chikungunya', 'clinical development', 'design', 'experience', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mosquito-borne', 'multidisciplinary', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U19,2019,7168390,-0.011303197025900203
"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations. Project Narrative The public health relevance of this proposal is that it will provide an infrastructure for analyzing impacts of dietary components and microbiomes throughout the body. The analysis of these maps will help us identify dietary components that improve resistance to infectious disease.",Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity,9785812,DP1AT010885,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Back', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consumption', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Disease Resistance', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Liquid substance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Microbe', 'Minerals', 'Miniaturization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutritional status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phytochemical', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'human subject', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'nanolitre scale', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'side effect', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP1,2019,1085000,-0.020873026912749233
"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",9651956,R21EB027396,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Candida albicans', 'Carbon', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral candidiasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'network models', 'open source', 'oral pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phenotypic data', 'preference', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2019,219161,-0.017343272369177907
"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Pro-inflammatory activation of human macrophages regulated by lncRNAs Project Summary Macrophage activation promotes major inflammatory disorders, including arterial diseases. Its underlying mechanisms, however, remain obscure. The present study will establish a systems approach, involving computational prediction analyses, multi-omics, network science, and in vitro and in vivo validation, to discover long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated mechanisms for pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and arterial disease. In Specific Aim 1, we will involve omics studies of human macrophages to identify lncRNAs and their interacting proteins and develop computational analyses to predict human lncRNAs that regulate macrophage activation. Specific Aim 2 will examine the functionality of candidate lncRNAs in macrophage activation in vitro and in vivo. The findings from the study will help to identify new mechanisms for macrophage activation and may provide molecular bases for new therapies. Project Narrative Inflammation plays a key role in coronary artery disease and other major vascular diseases, global health threats. Even with potent risk modifiers, e.g., statins, many patients still suffer vascular events. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate various biological processes.

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),9707307,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Caudovirales', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'DNA Viruses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Enteral', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Genome', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Norovirus', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'bacterial resistance', 'bacteriome', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'early childhood', 'experimental analysis', 'genome annotation', 'gut microbiome', 'human virome', 'improved', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'molecular sequence database', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'protein function', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tool', 'virology', 'virome']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2019,1872216,0.0025116794352951547
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment.

"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders. The implementation of an evolutionary, system-level model improves our understanding of modern human disease, and, validates existing and novel dietary interventions to lessen their incidence in industrialized societies.",Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease,9518889,R01DK112381,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Agriculture', 'Americas', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Civilization', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucose Metabolism Disorders', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Jamaica', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Triglycerides', 'Trinidad', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fecal metabolome', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lipid metabolism', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'nutrition related genetics', 'theories', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIDDK,"J.

"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9765383,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,113241,-0.03546491795759426
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9627935,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2019,2648073,0.004183285965150264
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",9913350,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2019,340000,-0.010697721335828046
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,9816677,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic wound', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Healing', 'Wound Infection', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,542166,-0.016000550412757348
"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,9672412,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'kidney biopsy', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2019,169110,0.012619708838207634
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9657637,U01AI124275,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antimicrobial drug', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal bacteria', 'commensal microbes', 'computational platform', 'computer studies', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'infection risk', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2019,1697054,0.011348567585262335
"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,9938134,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,497444,-0.008912847409193554
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9826831,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,734366,0.008740429311270783
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9703894,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,642740,0.020657352160693056
"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",9938200,R01HS027375,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,497273,0.0034145709695790182
"Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we generated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal (re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of not only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current renewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.  Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model, we were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring microbial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the early human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains unknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is driven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.  Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that under conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and hypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications. These modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as transcriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these offspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams onto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full spectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of maternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics data, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and offspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and molecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact. Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the root molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure. In the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal histone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and note that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and how these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.",Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity,9743790,R01DK089201,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diet', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fetus', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hepatic', 'High Fat Diet', 'Histone Code', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Individual', 'Lactation', 'Life', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phenotypic Sex', 'Plant Roots', 'Pregnancy', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'dysbiosis', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'genomic variation', 'gut microbiome', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in utero', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'maternal obesity', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'mother nutrition', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,653159,-0.005786143753891364
"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2.

"Molecular Biomarkers of Dangerous Intracranial Aneurysms Abstract Rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) causes intracranial hemorrhaging that leads to high rates of neurological deficits and death. Although rupture rates are low, clinicians must decide whether to treat or monitor these potentially dangerous lesions. In the current clinical practice, the most common metric to measure risk of rupture is aneurysm size (≥7 mm or ≥5 mm). However, clinical data show that small aneurysms can also rupture. As a result, alternative clinical stratification scores have been proposed, including the PHASES (Population, Hypertension, Age, Size, Earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage, and Site) score based on patient demographics and IA characteristics to stratify ruptured and unruptured IAs, and the Rupture Resemblance Score (RRS) that stratifies ruptured and unruptured IAs based on hemodynamic and morphological properties. However, all metrics require imagining on digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which is invasive, expensive, requires the use of X-rays, and is associated with transient or permanent neurological and non-neurological complications. In previous studies, we found that patients with and without IAs have RNA expression differences in their circulating blood that reflect leukocyte activation and inflammatory signaling. Expression differences could both identify the presence of IAs and stratify IA samples by size. We therefore hypothesize that individuals with dangerous IAs have detectable gene expression differences in their blood that could be used as biomarkers to determine rupture risk. In this Phase-I study, we propose to use whole blood transcriptomes to develop a “one- stop” diagnostic test that can detect the presence of IAs and determine the risk of rupture based on circulating RNA expression biomarkers using our prototype AneuScreenTM platform. We aim to: 1) Develop and validate biomarkers to predict risk indicated by the currently-used size metric, 2) Develop and validate biomarkers to predict risk indicated by the clinical PHASES score, and 2) Develop and validate biomarkers to predict risk indicated by the RRS. These biomarkers will save the healthcare millions in unnecessary high-cost imaging procedures and unnecessary aneurysm treatments. Project Narrative Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) can lead to devastating health consequences upon rupture. Because rupture is uncommon, there is a need for clinicians to have an objective metric of rupture risk that can help classify IAs as high-risk or low-risk lesions. In this project we aim to develop circulating whole blood gene expression biomarker of aneurysm risk. This biomarker once incorporated into our AneuScreenTM diagnostic platform will help avoid unnecessary aneurysm treatments by: (1) stratifying IA cases between those that are high-risk and require treatment, and those that are low-risk and can be periodically monitored; (2) enabling a low-cost, non-invasive alternative to frequently monitor IAs; and (3) determining the need for follow-up imaging in the case of a positive AneuScreenTM test, as low risk IAs may only need magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), while high risk IAs may directly receive DSA for imaging and possible preventive treatment. Successful completion of this Phase I will clarify if a pre-imaging blood test can stratifying IA risk. This augmented capability will lead to more vigilant and cost-effective IA management.",Molecular Biomarkers of Dangerous Intracranial Aneurysms,9907236,R43NS115314,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysm', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Cells', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Dangerousness', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Digital Subtraction Angiography', 'Dose', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive treatment', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'indexing', 'leukocyte activation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'phase 1 study', 'prototype', 'response', 'shear stress', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,"NEUROVASCULAR DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2019,224975,-0.01420358085124179
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9789913,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,750000,-0.013394679750706672
"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes.

"Impact of Maternal Diet and Supplements on Breast Milk Composition Breast-feeding is recommended to prevent the development of allergic diseases, but mechanisms are unclear. Human milk is a source of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and fatty acids (FAs), which are likely impacted by maternal diet. HMOs are complex glycans prevalent in human milk; non-digestible by humans, but one of the main substrates for the infant gut microbiota. We have recently shown that mothers' milk has significant variations in qualitative and quantitative HMO composition, depending on genetics and maternal probiotic supplementation. Human milk is a rich source of FAs such as polyunsaturated (PUFAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); these are strongly influenced by maternal diet and could directly induce mucosal immunity. The impact of maternal diet and supplements on immunomodulatory composition of human milk is poorly characterized and varies between mothers.  Our initial studies have shown that certain HMOs are associated with protection against cow's milk allergy in the infant, but the mechanisms are not known. Our initial study in the Old Order Mennonites (OOM), who have a lifestyle dating back to 150 years ago and rich exposure to unpasteurized milk, indicated a low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases, compared to the Rochester population. OOM mothers also have rich sources of diet-based probiotics such as unpasteurized dairy products (kefir, yogurt, cheese, butter); these can significantly affect their breast milk FA and HMO composition, whereas OTC supplement use may not be common. Our central hypothesis is that factors related to OOM diet decrease the risk of allergies through impact on human milk composition. Our preliminary data suggests that the infant gut microbiome is enriched in Bifidobacteria in the OOM. Bifidobacteria in turn are largely impacted by human milk composition.  The overall objective of this supplemental application is to expand our ongoing longitudinal infant cohort study, entitled “Mucosal and systemic immunity and food allergy” (U01 AI131344), by gathering and analyzing samples to define the role of maternal diet, including dietary and OTC probiotics on human milk composition, and to assess their impact on infant immunity. The parent study is characterizing the infant gut microbiome, immune markers and atopic diseases in the first year of life in OOM and Rochester infants. We have a unique opportunity to investigate maternal dietary impact on human milk composition. This additional data along with modeling as part of the parent grant will provide holistic understanding of interactions between OOM lifestyle and infant gut microbiome composition, immune markers and allergic disease outcomes in infants. 1 Our initial study in the Old Order Mennonites (OOM), who have a lifestyle dating back to 150 years ago and rich exposure to unpasteurized milk, indicated a low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases, compared to the Rochester population.

"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving but is limited by a shortage of organ donors and an unacceptably high donor organ discard rate. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on manual quantitation of key microscopic findings by pathologists. A major limitation of this microscopic examination is human variability and inefficiency in interpreting the findings, resulting in potentially healthy organs being deemed unsuitable for transplantation or potentially damaged organs being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model capable of automatically quantifying percent global glomerulosclerosis in whole slide images of donor kidney frozen section wedge biopsies. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, diminished health care costs, and improved patient outcomes. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated quantitative evaluation as the standard practice of donor kidney evaluation prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert kidney pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the computerized approach to quantifying percent global glomerulosclerosis and compare these results with current standard of care pathologist evaluation. The feasibility of deploying the Deep Learning model to analyze whole slide images on the cloud will also be examined. The end product of this STTR will be a web-based platform to securely deploy Deep Learning image analysis as a tool to assist pathologists with donor kidney biopsy evaluation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Before a kidney can be transplanted, the tissue must be assessed under a microscope to ensure the organ is healthy enough for transplant. A major limitation of microscopic examination is human variability in interpreting the findings, resulting in healthy organs being deemed unsuitable for transplantation.

"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9564111,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,564228,-0.010306356613320033
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,9640012,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'multiple omics', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,327382,0.0016412426701367814
"Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project we propose to develop Previse, a novel, software-based clinical decision support (CDS) system for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI), and attributing AKI to one of several causal mechanisms (etiologies). Previse will use machine learning methods and information drawn from the electronic health record (EHR) to identify the early signs of acute kidney injury. By doing so before the clinical syndrome of AKI is fully developed, Previse will give clinicians the time to intervene with the goals of preventing further kidney damage, and decreasing the sequelae of AKI. Combining this prediction module with a second module that suggests the underlying causes responsible for an incipient or full AKI, Previse will enable clinicians to make earlier and better-informed treatment decisions for AKI patients. Research Question: Can a machine- learning-based CDS predict the development and progression of AKI in hospitalized patients 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3, with performance providing an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of at least 0.85? Is it possible to use a Bayesian model to infer the cause of AKI with high accuracy (AUROC ≥ 0.75)? Prior work: We have developed a prototype version of the Previse system which predicts AKI up to 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3 criteria, with an AUROC near 0.70. We have previously developed machine-learning-based predictive tools for sepsis, in-hospital mortality, and other adverse patient events with performance significantly improved over commonly used rules-based scoring systems. Specific Aims: To predict the onset of chart-abstracted KDIGO stage 2 or 3 AKI in retrospective data, 72 hours in advance (Aim 1); to use data drawn from the EHR to identify the cause of AKI at time of onset with high accuracy, and to present this causal inference, its likelihood, and relevant evidence supporting it in a human-interpretable fashion (Aim 2). Methods: We will predict the onset of AKI using a deep, recurrent neural network (RNN). This expressive, nonlinear classifier will incorporate time-series information in the qualitative portions of the EHR and will also incorporate features derived from text components, such as radiology reports. Labeling AUROC of 0.85 or higher at 72 hours pre-KDIGO AKI will constitute success in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will train a dynamic Bayesian network to identify the cause of AKI. We will train this system using semi-supervised methods, where the causes of a set of AKI examples will be hand-annotated by clinician experts; these examples will be split into two groups, with some used for training and the remainder for testing. Aim 2 will be successful if this training results in etiology identification accuracy of at least 0.75 in the test set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the combined Previse system will be deployed for prospective studies at partner hospitals. Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 7% of all hospitalized patients each year in the United States, causing short-term and lasting harm, including increased risk of mortality. However, the existing tools for acute kidney injury detection have failed to offer significant anticipation of full-blown AKI, or to provide the insight into the AKI’s root cause, which are needed to make an impact on patient outcomes. We will develop Previse, a machine-learning-based prediction system that continuously monitors for incipient AKI and offers clinicians probable root causes of AKI.","Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology",9621546,R43AA027674,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head Start Program', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'computer based statistical methods', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAAA,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,349320,-0.020308446232654334
"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Our goal is to rapidly and accurately identify pathogens and their resistance markers to facilitate accurate antimicrobial therapy, reducing antibiotic overuse in non-infected infants.",Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis,9596299,R01AI134982,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth Weight', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Dyes', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Neonatal', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Very Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Viral', 'Whole Blood', 'Woman', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'circulating DNA', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early onset', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intrapartum', 'melting', 'microbial', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'overtreatment', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'point of care', 'premature', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'sample collection', 'septic', 'therapy resistant', 'viral detection']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,437420,-0.01285315135283688
"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9530668,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,584485,0.005533603013267017
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9418599,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,336980,0.008294227571945104
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States.

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9406318,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,356625,-0.035652129104777865
"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9436228,R21AI135641,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Helminths', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intestinal parasite', 'Intestines', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Source', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'helminth infection', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'prevent']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,220500,-0.004984000900220214
"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community.

"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community.

"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award. Narrative We will refine the operations of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford in coordination with other Phase II sites of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to diagnose the undiagnosed and facilitate a transition to sustainability. Our Center will bring Stanford’s long history in technology development, genomic data analysis, stem cell biology, and translational science to the team-based diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed disease. We will refine existing procedures to further optimize the diagnostic process and integrate care of the undiagnosed into clinical practice while preserving the scientific mission of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network.",Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford,9593406,U01HG010218,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Award', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child Health', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Organoids', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policy Maker', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'operation', 'outreach', 'patient outreach', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'reference genome', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'socioeconomics', 'stem cell biology', 'success', 'support network', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virtual']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,1420000,-0.010425295330150963
"FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to demonstrate utility to all major pathogenic bacterial strains of SeLux’s rapid, low-cost, phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) system (fast-AST or FAST). Utilizing existing optical detectors and standard dried antibiotic microplates, and avoiding pitfalls of metabolic probes, FAST will potentially transform therapy of infections by significantly accelerating AST, thereby facilitating treatment with the optimal antibiotic. Aim 1 will apply FAST to hundreds of samples of pathogenic bacterial strains, while developing and optimizing a predictive algorithm for clinical utility. Aim 2 will extend the FAST platform to slow-growing strains and species as well. SeLux has demonstrated FAST to exceed FDA 510(k) requirements for minimum inhibitory concentration determinations for 25+ strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with full antibiotic panels. Completion of the proposed aims will expand FAST to all major clinically-relevant, non-fastidious bacterial pathogens. SeLux’s interdisciplinary team has expertise in nanosensing, microbiology, and algorithm design and is buttressed by distinguished experts in Clinical Microbiology, Infectious Disease, and Machine Learning. The new paradigm in clinical medicine is value-based healthcare, which requires rapid and accurate diagnoses leading to optimal patient treatment. Nowhere is this more important than in treating infections, where doctors are currently forced to overprescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics during an agonizing 48+ hour wait for antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results. The novel, rapid, low-cost AST platform described in this proposal promises to reduce this delay in treatment by as much as 30 hours. This advance would be transformative for the treatment of infections because current over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics not only harms individual patients but is a primary contributor to the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance.","FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing",9464993,R43AI136125,"['Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'End Point Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Invaded', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Optics', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Quality of Care', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Affairs', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vancomycin', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis']",NIAID,"SELUX DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,298851,-0.023715576498174466
"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9503816,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'dravet syndrome', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,237423,-0.008955962262557947
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9472335,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,418408,0.015946863025132436
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,9639469,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'Zika Virus', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computer infrastructure', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,407175,0.001948107650611562
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9567622,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,659674,-0.005099034554075682
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9570304,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,528639,-0.004617398112244158
"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9420621,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human microbiota', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2018,374683,-0.004550925314048489
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9395904,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,352587,-0.009506073327171165
"The Blackfynn Platform for Rapid Data Integration and Collaboration Summary One in seven people worldwide suffers from a brain disorder, e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's, stroke, or dementia. Development of future treatments depends on improving our understanding of brain function and disease, and validating new treatments critically depends on identifying the underlying biomarkers associated with different conditions. Biomarker discovery requires volume, quality, richness, and diversity of data. This Direct-to-Phase II project extends Blackfynn's cloud data management platform for team science, in order to support interactive data curation and integration and to facilitate biomarker discovery. Our first technical aim develops tools to help select, curate, assess, and regularize datasets: we develop novel “live” query capabilities to ensure users discover relevant data, develop mechanisms for using data's provenance to decide on trustworthiness, and build tools for mapping fields to common data elements. These capabilities address the critical, under-served problem of selecting the data to analyze. Our second technical aim develops techniques for incorporating algorithms to link and co-register across multi-modal data and metadata. Using ranking and machine learning, we can incorporate and combine state-of-the-art algorithms for finding data relationships, and we can link to remote data sources. These capabilities enable scientists to analyze richer datasets with multiple data modalities and properties – thus enabling them to discover more complex correlations and biomarkers. In our third aim, Blackfynn's new technical capabilities will be applied to challenges faced by Blackfynn partners, including problems assessing trustworthiness of data annotations, conducting image analysis, modeling epileptic networks, and identifying biomarkers for neuro-oncology indications. As part of this validation we will also develop HIPAA-compliant mechanisms for working with protected and de-identified data together. Together, these three thrusts will ensure that development of the Blackfynn platform results in tools and technologies that meaningfully accelerate scientific understanding and discovery over rich and complex data, leading to improved treatments for neurologic disease.   Narrative This Direct-to-Phase II project extends the Blackfynn cloud data management platform to enable biomarker discovery for research and development of improved drugs, devices and clinical care for patients with neurologic disease: it develops tools for assembling, evaluating, and rating data, and linking it across modalities and to external systems.

"Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network II ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to certain immunosuppressive medications, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of over 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage novel analysis tools to analyze the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify subgroups of patients with shared expression profiles. And, to combine this data with clinical characteristics and kidney biopsy pathology features to predict response to immunosuppressive therapy. It will utilize advanced analysis techniques which are ideal for rare disease when traditional statistical methods are not well equipped to identify relevant predictors from the large number of potential parameters across the genotype-phenotype continuum. The aims are: Aim 1: To utilize consensus non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on glomerular and tubular genome wide mRNA expression data to identify functional subclasses of NEPTUNE participants. Aim 2: To utilize machine learning algorithms to identify predictors of response to initial immunosuppressive therapy from clinical characteristics, kidney biopsy pathology features and gene expression clusters. The objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by identifying novel, biologically-relevant predictors of treatment response. Risk stratification is useful not only to inform patients and clinicians who are making treatment decisions, but also allows stratification of patients at high risk of treatment failure into clinical trials of novel agents. LAY NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the significant toxicity from the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use clinical characteristics, gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue and pathology features from the kidney biopsy to quantify the likelihood that an individual person will fail to respond to immunosuppressive medications. This approach, if validated, may help to inform patients and clinicians about the risk of treatment failure.",Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network II,9716867,U54DK083912,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Edema', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individual response', 'mRNA Expression', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U54,2018,71580,-0.00044929902976073593
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9534732,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,550853,-0.020971502181199572
"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration. These features are not well recapitulated by the current biomarkers in use in the clinic, majority of them are DNA based mutation assays. RNA expression patterns have been described by various investigators and may more fully recapitulate tumor biology. The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay. By utilizing an assay developed to classify CRC by its tumor biology, we anticipate development of an enduring tool that will be of greater use than traditional fit-for-purpose tests.   NARRATIVE The molecular characteristics of colon cancer can be described by RNA-based expression, and a consensus classification method has been developed.

"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9411095,R01DC011805,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2018,699626,-0.03474977599962524
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9427452,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cornea', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,400000,-0.010074033844702492
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9487840,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2018,141048,-0.013746546838381692
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9473087,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2018,601486,0.007828812497603553
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9501395,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,798023,0.010701362032890084
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9495704,U01GM110721,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunological Models', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2018,396544,-0.0011221070268177685
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,9583334,K99HD096125,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ductal Epithelial Cell', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Fetal Mortality Statistics', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Nephrons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'maternal serum', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pregnancy disorder', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'stillbirth', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'urinary']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,K99,2018,104534,-0.0057128866600517705
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess greater accuracy to identify fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic disease and provide meaningful clinical information to health- care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases,9555179,R44AI129147,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Europe', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mixed Connective Tissue Disease', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Myalgia', 'Neuraxis', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'bone erosion', 'care providers', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'human disease', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'phase 1 study', 'rheumatologist', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2018,498258,0.021783632065781402
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9455006,U19AI135972,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'virus pathogenesis']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2018,2799687,0.004183285965150264
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9460547,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2018,166104,-0.01273610393528739
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities.

"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9502388,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,340491,-0.0018562748176166894
"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9503881,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'tomography', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2018,170640,-0.022787176263500592
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9503015,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2018,664486,0.006171762401957194
"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9455026,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2018,263805,-0.01617951345038132
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Partelligence Abstract Halo Labs proposes to develop “Partelligence” a particle ID technique that enables accurate and rapid identification of contaminating particles in biopharmaceutical formulations. Protein therapeutics currently represent between 15 and 30% of the overall pharmaceutical market. The primary concern for this class of therapeutics is that they can elicit an immune response from patients who develop anti- drug antibodies. The drug’s effect is therefore eliminated between 1 and 10 percent of patients who return to their original disease state. The presence of particulate matter in these therapeutics (e.g. shed glass from a syringe or a protein aggregate) can enhance this immune response and, due to the patient safety risk the FDA regulates the amount of particles that can be present. There are always some number of particles in each injected sample, and although their presence can be detected, they don’t know what the particles actually are. A QC tool that can identify the particles would help manufactures trace them back to their source (e.g. a bad lot of syringes) and eliminate them. Partelligence aims to make particle identification routine in biopharma QC. The technology builds off our current instrument, Horizon, which was launched in mid-2017 and already sold to some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. The technique works by analyzing several combinatorial features including size, morphology, optical contrast, and intrinsic fluorescence, and in this proposal we will test which features are key to enable the most accurate and rapid particle recognition. To date, we have performed feasibility experiments validating our ability to identify a few commonly found particles in biopharma solutions. Given this, our goals in Phase I are to expand on these studies by building a comprehensive training set and by testing a number of different algorithms. We will first start with reference samples, and then move to real biopharmaceutical samples provided by our pharma collaborators. At the end of the study, we will do a feasibility analysis to determine if the throughput, specificity and reliability meets the needs of the industry. Narrative We propose to evaluate a particle recognition technique to enable accurate and rapid identification of unwanted contaminating particles in biopharmaceutical formulations. Successful development of this analytical technique would improve bioprocess control by identifying dangers early on in development and throughout the manufacturing process, resulting in safer protein drugs, reduced recalls and shortened time to market.",Partelligence,9679781,R43GM132995,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Alpha Particles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Products', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fluorescence', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Formulation', 'Generations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Rubber', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Syringes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'bioprocess', 'combinatorial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'forest', 'imaging modality', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'instrument', 'manufacturing process', 'microscopic imaging', 'particle', 'patient response', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'protein aggregate', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'trend']",NIGMS,"OPTOFLUIDICS, INC.",R43,2018,203830,-0.033824172490038086
"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism. Vaccine prevention of even a fraction of these life-threatening diseases could have a significant impact on the health of people around the world.",Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine,9502903,R01AI132117,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Collection', 'Complement Factor H', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunity', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organism', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Peptide Vaccines', 'Peptide antibodies', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Vaccines', 'Recombinants', 'Rheumatic Heart Disease', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Streptococcal Infections', 'Streptococcal Vaccines', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'bactericide', 'base', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'hybrid protein', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peptide structure', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein structure', 'retinal S antigen peptide M', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2018,879004,-0.0231848741239241
"Omics Data Integration to Identify Disease Pathways in COPD Project Summary Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develops chronic airflow limitation and/or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). Using several NIH and foundation grants, we have systematically generated genetic, genomics, proteomic, and metabolomics profiles from the NHLBI supported COPDGene cohort, which includes 10,300 current and former smokers age 45-80. This proposal will focus on integrating the omics data generated in the five-year followup (Phase II) of the COPDgene study to identify molecular subtypes of COPD across a broad range of blood profiles (Specific Aim 1). Biomarkers and pathways discriminating the molecular subtypes, in addition to other COPD phenotypes will then be identified (Specific Aim 2). These results will identify markers that are specific to smoking-related lung disease and can be used to develop novel diagnostic tests and therapies for early prevention and treatment of COPD. Relevance to Public Health Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the United States. The major risk factor is smoking; however, most smokers do not develop COPD and the factors that identify who goes from normal to abnormal lung function are unknown. This proposal will use already collected data on existing NHLBI cohorts to identify blood signatures that can identify who will be at risk for developing smoking related lung disease.

"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9530534,R21AI132978,"['Acute', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fever', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modality', 'Mycoses', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'candidemia', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'evaluation/testing', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'migration', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,198750,0.004000072927142394
"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Finding novel approaches to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is a pressing clinical need. This project investigates the role of bacterial strains as predictors of UC remission after fecal microbiota transplant, and presents novel methods to identify therapeutic strains that will be tested in a mouse model of colitis.",Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis,9521026,R01DK114038,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bacteria', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotguns', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Supervision', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States', 'Voting', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'clinical remission', 'cohort', 'design', 'fecal transplantation', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'method development', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'placebo group', 'potential biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'probiotic therapy', 'prophylactic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'simulation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,253287,0.012563034716908231
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9572405,R21MD011439,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'Cell physiology', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endometrium', 'Enhancers', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinically significant', 'cost efficient', 'disparity reduction', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'ethnic difference', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'social', 'stressor', 'survival outcome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2018,200434,-0.01263659929945819
"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9592308,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2018,113241,-0.03546491795759426
"Sterol and Isoprenoid Diseases Consortium Supplement 2018 Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a rare inherited neurocutaneous disease characterized by ichthyosis, spastic diplegia or tetraplegia, intellectual disability, and a distinctive retinopathy. It is caused by mutations in ALDH3A2, which codes for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) and results in abnormal lipid metabolism. Despite knowing the gene defect and enzyme abnormality, the pathogenic mechanisms are still unclear and no single biomarker exists that correlates with disease severity. FALDH deficiency results in several lipid abnormalities including accumulation of fatty aldehydes, which have potential toxic effects via formation of covalent adducts with proteins and lipids. This unusual lipid abnormality has the potential to affect multiple unrelated cellular pathways that are critical for disease pathogenesis. Our recent metabolomic studies in SLS have identified a unique biochemical profile of at least 30 metabolites in plasma that suggests disruption of several previously unsuspected pathways. We now propose to mine our STAIR 7004 clinical database of 20 SLS patients together with their associated metabolomic data to develop a minimal “metabolomic profile” that will correlate with severity of clinical symptoms and function as a reliable biomarker. These studies will utilize various statistical analytical methods, including principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and random forest analysis, to define a minimal group of clinically informative metabolites, representing multiple biochemical pathways, for construction of a SLS metabolomic profile. When completed, this research will provide an objective biomarker for SLS disease description and therapeutic monitoring. Sjögren-Larsson syndrome is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by congenital ichthyosis, spasticity, intellectual disability and a distinct retinopathy. It is caused by mutations in a gene called ALDH3A2 and results in abnormal lipid metabolism. The pathogenic mechanisms that are responsible for the symptoms are still not defined.

"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,9505946,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,387714,-0.003156573826905053

"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,9431752,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2018,170193,0.012619708838207634
"Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NCI’s mission to support research into the diagnosis of cancer.",Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection,9446030,R01CA215574,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'American', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Adenoma', 'Colonic Diseases', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'New England', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resected', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Somatic Cell', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer screening', 'colon carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'fecal microbiome', 'forest', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'rRNA Genes', 'screening', 'stool sample', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,627529,-0.004197316771438243
"Phamarcogenomics of Statin Therapy (SUPPLEMENT) PARENT ABSTRACT The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin-treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well- characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin- induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects 1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT ABSTRACT In response to NOT-AG-18-008, our goal is to extend the validation and application of our data integration methodologies into Alzheimer’s disease research. This administrative supplement is designed to extend the work of the existing subaward to the University of Pennsylvania subcontract for the POST Informatics Core. The PGRN POST Informatics Core serves as the central hub for data sharing and coordination across the three POST projects in the PGRN P50 award. One of our jobs is annotating the extensive information that will be collected and providing analysis expertise to the projects as needed. However, to make great strides in scientific progress and ensure that the collective whole of the Center is greater than the sum of the parts, a key function of the Informatics Core is to serve as ‘The Integrator’ to combine these data and information. We and others have shown that integration of complementary omics-based data can provide emergent insights into biological processes compared to what can be learned through any single approach alone. The methods that we are developing to integrate data for statin pharmacogenomic phenotypes will be equally applicable in the area of Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, recent emphasis on open data science by Alzheimer’s disease researchers provides ample data for us to interrogate our method. We have developed novel statistical analysis tools such as the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations (ATHENA), and data visualization tools, such as PhenoGram, both of which are designed to collect and combine information from diverse data sources. With these tools, we will leverage publicly available Alzheimer’s disease datasets to maximize the knowledge gleaned about disease risk for Alzheimer’s diseases. The methodologies that we have been developing as part of the PGRN POST award for the past 2.5 years are clearly applicable to the study of Alzheimer’s disease risk. An important validation step of the application of our methodologies is to apply them to different types of datasets and in different phenotypic areas. This administrative supplement focused on extended research into having an Alzheimer’s disease focus is a great mechanism to simultaneously allow us to validate our methodologies with different types of data and potentially identify important risk factors and pathways toward a better understanding of the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, we may have the opportunity to identify cross biological implications due to the known pleiotropic relationships between Alzheimer’s disease and cardiovascular disease.

"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,9483343,R01HL126947,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Decitabine', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distal', 'Drug resistance', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hypercellular Bone Marrow', 'Hypermethylation', 'ITGB3 gene', 'Ineffective Hematopoiesis', 'Introns', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Molecular', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'PPBP gene', 'Pancytopenia', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'cytopenia', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'in vivo', 'ineffective therapies', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular marker', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'unnecessary treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,389800,-0.0024125822577261875
"Competing Revision - Precision Medicine and Oral Anticoagulants Pharmacogenomics and other ‘omics methods are cornerstone technologies that will drive biomarker discovery for the Personalized Medicine revolution. However, these technical advances are not yet uniformly applied, as there is under-representation in personalized medicine (PM) research that cuts across ages, genders, racial minorities, and socioeconomic groups. This is particularly true for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations, which are critical communities to involve in discovery research for several reasons. First, these populations have been neglected to date, partly due to a lack of community engagement and historical mistrust around the scientific enterprise. Second, these oftentimes isolated populations can have differences in the prevalence of known, function-disrupting gene variants of clinical significance and/or may possess novel variants with altered function. Third, the effects of unique dietary and other environmental influences among these AI/AN populations on drug response may be modified by genetic variation. We address these issues in Aims 1-3 of Project 2 of our Program Project grant, which seeks a better understanding of the relationship between novel measurements of short- and long-term hepatic vitamin K status, variation in vitamin K cycle genes, and warfarin anticoagulation outcomes. Warfarin is still the most commonly used drug in its pharmacological class in the US and has enormous clinical utility for AI/AN populations, who have more restricted access to emergency hospital facilities and expensive new anticoagulant medications. In Aim 1 we will develop more sensitive and specific biomarkers of hepatic vitamin K status than the existing plasma ELISA-based PIVKA-II and vitamin K assays, using LC-MS/MS-based approaches to quantitate all eleven (proteo)forms of carboxylated prothrombin (Factor II) in plasma and CYP4F2-dependent vitamin K catabolites in urine. This is biologically significant because hepatic vitamin K levels affect Factor II proteoform synthesis and several undercarboxylated proteoforms have clotting factor activity. In Aim 2, we will use our enhanced assays to (A) characterize short- and long-term hepatic vitamin K status in three AI/AN populations and test its association with CYP4F2*3 and (B) directly test whether the gene variant modifies the effect of vitamin K supplementation on hepatic vitamin K status. In Aim 3, we will test whether prospectively applied pharmacogenetic and biomarkers tests of hepatic vitamin K status are associated with long-term hemostasis control in AI/AN (and all other) populations receiving warfarin-based anticoagulation therapy. These aims are highly clinically significant. Specifically, they will enhance our understanding of the regulation of hepatic vitamin K status, and by inference all human vitamin K-dependent Gla proteins, by CYP4F2. The results may also further the development of a new decision tree for warfarin versus DOAC therapy based on the aforementioned PM test results.s. PROGRAM NARRATIVE The coordinated efforts of these Projects and Cores will advance our knowledge of gene-environment-drug interactions in the treatment of cardiovascular disease with anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. This, we believe, can lead to safer and more effective drug therapies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in AI/AN people and the general population.

"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9593059,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,750000,-0.013394679750706672

"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9390382,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'capillary', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,559269,-0.010306356613320033
"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9355693,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,406785,0.005533603013267017
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9306637,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,340545,0.008294227571945104
"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9295067,R21NS090349,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Eye', 'FarGo', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iron', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic field', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood regulation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2017,198365,-0.02076382332317886
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics.

"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community. Project Narrative Viruses are abundant in many environments and are important to public health. New statistical and computational tools will be developed for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples and for the prediction of virus-host interactions. These tools will be used to analyze microbial data sets related to liver cirrhosis and travelers’ diarrhea as well as marine metagenomics data sets from various geographic locations and time series.",Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications,9312083,R01GM120624,"['Affect', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Body Water', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Measures', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Network-based', 'Oceans', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Soil', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traveler&apos', 's diarrhea', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'interest', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'particle', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,395858,0.0036453300966786456
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9260548,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,356625,-0.035652129104777865
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9279027,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'CCL26 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Standardization', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'illness length', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,156324,0.003403440842259703
"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9369284,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,197528,-0.008955962262557947
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9250167,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,400107,0.015946863025132436
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9382777,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,711253,-0.005099034554075682
"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9221662,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2017,377226,-0.004550925314048489
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9323604,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'pediatric department', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2017,1500000,0.0013533228210178291
"The Blackfynn Platform for Rapid Data Integration and Collaboration Summary One in seven people worldwide suffers from a brain disorder, e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's, stroke, or dementia. Development of future treatments depends on improving our understanding of brain function and disease, and validating new treatments critically depends on identifying the underlying biomarkers associated with different conditions. Biomarker discovery requires volume, quality, richness, and diversity of data. This Direct-to-Phase II project extends Blackfynn's cloud data management platform for team science, in order to support interactive data curation and integration and to facilitate biomarker discovery. Our first technical aim develops tools to help select, curate, assess, and regularize datasets: we develop novel “live” query capabilities to ensure users discover relevant data, develop mechanisms for using data's provenance to decide on trustworthiness, and build tools for mapping fields to common data elements. These capabilities address the critical, under-served problem of selecting the data to analyze. Our second technical aim develops techniques for incorporating algorithms to link and co-register across multi-modal data and metadata. Using ranking and machine learning, we can incorporate and combine state-of-the-art algorithms for finding data relationships, and we can link to remote data sources. These capabilities enable scientists to analyze richer datasets with multiple data modalities and properties – thus enabling them to discover more complex correlations and biomarkers. In our third aim, Blackfynn's new technical capabilities will be applied to challenges faced by Blackfynn partners, including problems assessing trustworthiness of data annotations, conducting image analysis, modeling epileptic networks, and identifying biomarkers for neuro-oncology indications. As part of this validation we will also develop HIPAA-compliant mechanisms for working with protected and de-identified data together. Together, these three thrusts will ensure that development of the Blackfynn platform results in tools and technologies that meaningfully accelerate scientific understanding and discovery over rich and complex data, leading to improved treatments for neurologic disease.   Narrative This Direct-to-Phase II project extends the Blackfynn cloud data management platform to enable biomarker discovery for research and development of improved drugs, devices and clinical care for patients with neurologic disease: it develops tools for assembling, evaluating, and rating data, and linking it across modalities and to external systems. It also validates the techniques' effectiveness using real challenges faced by Blackfynn partners, in imaging, epilepsy, and brain tumor research.",The Blackfynn Platform for Rapid Data Integration and Collaboration,9343385,R44DA044929,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Case Study', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Common Data Element', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Notification', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plug-in', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trust', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cloud platform', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data management', 'improved', 'indexing', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIDA,"BLACKFYNN, INC.",R44,2017,652921,-0.012560617151819832
"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD. Relevance: The proposed research study is of considerable public health importance given that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have an increased risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events and mortality. The development of improved non-invasive imaging techniques to assess PAD may enable optimized treatment for individuals who are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients with Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease,9363302,R01HL137763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intermittent Claudication', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Leg', 'Legal patent', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodist Church', 'Methodology', 'Microcirculation', 'Muscle', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oxygen', 'Partial Pressure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reference Values', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Standardization', 'Superficial Femoral Artery', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Treadmill Tests', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Walking', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'post intervention', 'regional difference', 'research study', 'skeletal', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treadmill', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional', 'vascular sonography']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,518262,-0.020971502181199572
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,9355203,K99GM118907,"['Adjuvant', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biology', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Resistance', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal lavage', 'Phase', 'Phosphorus', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Sulfur', 'Supplementation', 'Symbiosis', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bactericide', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'counterscreen', 'desensitization', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infectious disease treatment', 'insight', 'killings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2017,87929,0.0026264987546315978
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations.

"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9216965,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,388615,-0.009506073327171165
"Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood Several million units of donor platelets are transfused annually in the US and Europe to treat patients undergoing radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or organ transplant surgery. Although transfusions of donor- derived platelets are an effective way to treat thrombocytopenic patients, numerous concerns have been raised due to the increase in demand, the five-day shelf-life, and the possibilities for contamination. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow and are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The long-term objective of this proposal is to generate platelets ex vivo from HSPC- enriched umbilical cord blood that will allow us to address a vast public need. Recent studies have shown that the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can greatly affect expansion of progenitor cells, but can reduce MK differentiation efficiency. My central hypothesis is that epigenetic and transcriptional changes prime or desensitize HSPC to MK differentiation cues. To investigate the role of epigenetic signals during HSPC-to- MK transition, I propose to perform high-throughput ChIP and RNA-sequencing to discover differentially active regulatory elements between expanded (low potential) and fresh cord blood HSPCs. This highly interdisciplinary and collaborative proposal utilizes computational biology and machine-learning to identify differentially active regulatory elements, and associate genetic features with MK fate. To validate my findings and establish a causal relationship between histone modifications of certain regions and MK potential, I will generate a dCas9-fusion protein that can directly manipulate the epigenetic marker at a targeted site. My findings will establish the mechanism of action of chromatin-modifying agents such as HDACi, and the causal relationship between the epigenome and MK differentiation. My highly collaborative proposal with the Miller, Bagheri, and Mahmud lab will substantially enhance our understanding of hematopoietic differentiation toward manufacturing platelets. Project Narrative More than two million platelet units from donors are used to treat patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy every year, but short shelf-life, increasing demand, and risk of contamination keep platelets in strained supply. In my proposed study, I will apply a panel of small molecules to expand and differentiate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood into platelet-producing cells. My work will identify the role of epigenetic modifications during the culture process, and elucidate new strategies to efficiently manufacture platelets from culture.",Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood,9345356,F31HL134331,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Computational Biology', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deacetylase', 'Deacetylation', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Europe', 'GATA1 gene', 'GATA2 transcription factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Growth', 'HDAC3 gene', 'HDAC6 gene', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Histones', 'Influentials', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Microtubules', 'Modification', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'Supervision', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Tryptophan', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Valproic Acid', 'Work', 'alpha Tubulin', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'desensitization', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput screening', 'histone acetyltransferase', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'large scale production', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'sarcoma', 'small molecule', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,38039,-0.013493610897515962
"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments. A preliminary diagnosis and qualitative feedback shall also be collected from non-trained GP doctors using the mobile tools in order to ascertain usability and diagnostic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary disease is a very large public health concern in India, as well as in most developing countries. Relatively few general practitioner (GP) doctors are trained to properly diagnose pulmonary disease, and affordable tools for diagnostic support simply do not exist. This proposal seeks to validate and test the use of low-cost mobile phone-based diagnostic tools for pulmonary disease.            ",Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening,9356362,R21TW010245,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Ayurvedic Medicine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biomass', 'Bronchitis', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Cookstove', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Feedback', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Household Air Pollution', 'India', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Site', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'digital', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meter', 'mobile computing', 'primary care setting', 'public health relevance', 'rural area', 'screening', 'tool', 'usability']",FIC,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2017,164421,-0.06212579643775594
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9275314,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2017,142177,-0.013746546838381692
"Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data SYSTEMS LEVEL CAUSAL DISCOVERY IN HETEROGENEOUS TOPMED DATA ABSTRACT The advent of new technologies for collecting and analyzing multiple heterogeneous data streams from the same individual makes possible the detailed phenotypic characterization of diseases and paves the way for the development of individualized precision therapies. A major bottleneck in this process is the lack of robust, efficient and truly integrative analytic methods for such multi-modal data. This proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of causal learning in biomedicine. The objective of this application is to extend, modify and tailor our causal probabilistic graphical models to data typically collected by TOPMed projects, such as –omics data (SNPs, metabolomics, RNA-seq, etc), imaging, patients' history, and clinical data. COPDGene® is one of the TOPMed projects and has generated datasets with those modalities for 10,000 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with different characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping or prediction of disease progression. In this project we will apply, test and validate our approaches on COPDGene® and another large independent COPD cohort. The extension and application of our methods to cross-sectional and longitudinal data will also allow us to investigate a number of important questions and aspects related to COPD. Mechanistically, we will investigate how SNPs, genes and their networks are causally linked to disease phenotypes. In pathology, we will identify conditional biomarkers, which will lead to disease sub-classification and identification of causal components in each subtype. In pathophysiology, we will identify features that are directly linked to lung function decline and outcome. We will make all our algorithms and results available to the community through web and public cloud interfaces. The deliverables will be (1) new probabilistic approaches for integration and analysis of multi-modal cross-sectional and longitudinal data, including SNPs, blood biomarkers, CT scans and clinical data; (2) new cloud-based server to make these approaches available to the research community; (3) results on the mechanism, pathology and pathophysiology of COPD facilitation and progression. To guarantee the success of the project we have assembled a team of experts in genomics, machine learning, cloud computing and COPD. This cross- disciplinary team project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables, since the generality of our approaches makes them applicable to any disease. We expect that during this U01 we will have the opportunity to collaborate with other teams in the TOPMed consortium to help them investigate the causes of their corresponding disease phenotypes. We do believe that data integration in a single probabilistic framework will be in the heart of precision medicine strategies in the future, when massive high-throughput data collection will become a routine diagnostic and prognostic procedure in all hospitals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current technologies for high-throughput biomedical data collection allow the interrogation of multiple modalities from a single patient. New promising analytical methods started emerging, which can analyze those multi-modal data in a holistic way. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitutes the third leading cause of death and a major cause of disability and health care costs in the US. The prevailing view is that COPD is a syndrome, consisting of multiple diseases with their own characteristics. There is currently no satisfactory method for COPD subtyping. We will apply, test and validate new probabilistic approaches on two cohorts of COPD patients. We will investigate the mechanisms of disease facilitation; we will identify patient cohorts with specific characteristics (disease subtypes); and investigate risk factors and causal variants for the disease progression in each subtype.  ",Systems Level Causal Discovery in Heterogeneous TOPMed Data,9310591,U01HL137159,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision genomic medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2017,607934,0.007828812497603553
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model.

"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9279143,U01GM110721,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronaviridae', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunological Models', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2017,202814,-0.0011221070268177685
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for Chagas disease Summary Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases with distinct characteristics that thrive mainly among the poorest populations of the world. There are 17 NTDs prioritized by the World Health Organization which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people globally, which costs these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The neglected tropical diseases result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. For example, 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected. Chagas disease has a serious economic impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where the disease is not indigenous, is estimated to be $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved treatments for Chagas disease and the two available treatments used outside the U.S. have toxic side effects. New therapeutics for Chagas disease and the other NTDs are desperately needed. Using a machine learning model based on published data for compounds tested against T. cruzi we have identified the EU-approved antimalarial pyronaridine as particularly active in vitro and in vivo with statistically significant efficacy in a 4-day mouse model of infection with a T. cruzi strain expressing firefly luciferase. Pyronaridine demonstrated 85.2% parasite reduction after 4 days treatment, and is known to have a long half-life in humans (13.2 days), promising toxicity profile (less toxic than chloroquine in malaria treatment) and may suggest a drug repurposing opportunity for further study. We propose in this project to determine the minimum effective dose (treatment regimen) for pyronaridine in the acute model of Chagas disease. We will also determine efficacy in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (sterile cure). We will pursue combination therapy DMPK profiling as well as performing combination therapy in vivo efficacy in chronic model of Chagas disease. The results will enable us to assess whether this EU approved drug is worthy of a clinical trial for Chagas disease in the UH3 stage. If successful we will design a clinical study and recruit patients for a phase II trial. This grant represents a unique opportunity to partner the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases (www.cdipd.org) at UCSD and the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil with Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. Narrative Approximately 6 to 7 million people in Latin America are infected with the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of the deadly Chagas disease. This disease is gaining recognition as an emerging infection in the United States where an estimated 300,000 people may be infected and there is no FDA approved treatment. The antimalarial pyronaridine was recently identified by our groups using computational Bayesian repurposing methods and was confirmed as active when tested in vitro and in vivo in the acute mouse model of Chagas disease. We now propose in the UH2 stage to determine: the minimum effective dose in the acute model of Chagas disease and efficacy in the chronic phase while also assessing potential for combination therapy.

"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9238793,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2017,166104,-0.01273610393528739
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9262478,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,348188,0.010932393664546833
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9308279,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,366940,-0.0018562748176166894
"Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This work seeks to understand whether long non-coding RNAs implicate in the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a form of malignant brain tumors. By characterizing these novel gene regulatory molecules in GBM, we expect to identify novel biomarkers that can be used as a prognostic tool for patients with GBM. This approach could also be applied to other human cancers.",Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas,9321295,R21CA209345,"['19q', 'Achievement', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nucleotides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Inactivation', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'flexibility', 'gene function', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'molecular subtypes', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'oligo (dT)', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,165732,-0.04345237967846809
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes.

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,9325416,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2017,413065,-0.009943227988238868
"Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) PROJECT SUMMARY In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assigned its highest antibiotic resistance threat level to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). CRE are resistant to nearly all routinely used antibiotics with gram-negative coverage and have been implicated in several high-profile nosocomial outbreaks in United States (U.S.) facilities. Although in past outbreaks institutions have deployed aggressive and highly bundled responses, this “kitchen sink” approach is unlikely to be resource- or cost-effective as CRE become endemic in the U.S. Evidence-based CRE policies are necessary, but fundamental gaps in knowledge remain. In particular, heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in CRE, which are broadly classifiable by whether carbapenem resistance does (“CP-CRE”) or does not (“non-CP-CRE”) arise from carbapenemase production. Until recently resistance testing was limited in clinical settings, but this landscape is changing with the rollout of commercially available assays for identifying carbapenemase production. However, data on the prevalence of CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in U.S. patients, especially among high-risk hospitalized populations, are limited. Moreover, some evidence suggests that propensity for intra-facility spread differs between CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE, but rigorous data are lacking. Evaluating epidemiological differences in CRE resistance types is essential to establishing public health priorities for CRE prevention in U.S. healthcare facilities. Aim 1 will evaluate the prevalence of and pre-admission risk factors for rectal colonization with CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE in a cohort of approximately 1900 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and comprehensive transplant unit (CTU) at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Risk factors will be analyzed with machine learning methodologies in order to develop a user-friendly decision tree to identify patients at high-risk of CP-CRE and/or non-CP-CRE carriage for future targeted surveillance screening. Aim 2 will utilize serially collected rectal swabs, in conjunction with clinical and environmental data, to estimate the incidence of nosocomial CP-CRE and non-CP-CRE colonization and to evaluate the contribution of asymptomatic CRE carriers and individual-level risk factors on a patient's risk of CRE acquisition during unit hospitalization. Strain-typing and other analyses as needed (e.g., whole genome sequencing) will be available to ascertain transmission events. This will be the first study in a U.S. hospital to investigate CRE spread associated exclusively with asymptomatic carriers and stratified by resistance type in a non-outbreak setting. The broad, long-term goals of this proposal are to advance our understanding of the epidemiology of CRE colonization and the implications of CRE resistance mechanisms to routes of nosocomial acquisition in order to guide CRE control policies and resource prioritization in U.S. healthcare facilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heterogeneous mechanisms encode carbapenem resistance in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Understanding the infection control implications of this heterogeneity has assumed newfound relevance with the rollout of resistance mechanism assays to identify carbapenemase production. The proposed research seeks to examine whether risk factors for CRE colonization and propensity for organism spread in the hospital environment differ by CRE resistance type, in order to promote evidence-based strategies for CRE control in U.S. hospitals.",Infection Control Implications of Heterogeneous Resistance Mechanisms in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE),9267654,R36HS025089,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R36,2017,41785,-0.00399516937859665
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,9325499,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,317128,-0.006772426448847574
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9373089,R21AI132978,"['Acute', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fever', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modality', 'Mycoses', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'candidemia', 'cohort', 'evaluation/testing', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'migration', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,198750,0.004000072927142394
"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9308943,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Genetic', 'Glycosides', 'IGA Glomerulonephritis', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Standardization', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'exhaustion', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,200347,-0.025573232494202416
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments.

"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9455051,R21MD011439,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'Cell physiology', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endometrium', 'Enhancers', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinically significant', 'cost efficient', 'disparity reduction', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'ethnic difference', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'social', 'stressor', 'survival outcome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2017,254325,-0.01263659929945819
"Optimizing electrical impedance myography outcomes through data mining Project summary  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technology for the assessment of muscle that is based on the application of a weak, high frequency electrical current to a muscle and the measurement of the resulting surface voltages. The further development and application of EIM remains the main business focus of Skulpt, Inc, a small business concern based in Boston and San Francisco (Specific Aims just say San Francisco). Alterations to the condition of the muscle, including myocyte atrophy, fat and connective tissue deposition, and inflammation all alter the EIM data in predictable and consistent ways. To date, through Skulpt, EIM has been applied as a potential biomarker for assessing disease progression and response to therapy in a wide variety of neuromuscular disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy, as well as other disorders that impact muscle condition, such as disuse atrophy and sarcopenia (age related muscle loss); over 1000 people have been studied with Skulpt’s EIM technology. Whereas the results of these applications are promising, the analytic approaches taken to the data sets have been fairly basic, utilizing only simple single frequency or simplistic multifrequency values. However, with every single muscle measurement, over 240 individual data points are acquired at different frequencies, different depths of muscle penetration, and at different angles to the major muscle fiber direction. Moreover, each of the above studies has been done in isolation, and thus how results differ between diseases is unknown. Given the plethora of data, applying more sophisticated analytic approaches has the potential of yielding improved EIM measures. Moreover, collaborators have already collected an associated wealth of animal EIM data that will help further inform this analysis. Thus, in this proposed Phase 1 SBIR, we plan to apply a variety of data mining techniques to the vast set of data already accumulated at Skulpt, Inc such that improved EIM outcomes can be developed and implemented. In Specific Aim 1, we will study human data across all disease types evaluated to determine which data sets are most effective at discriminating diseased from healthy muscle as well as distinguishing between diseases. In Specific Aim 2, we will focus on finding the metrics that are most sensitive to the degree of muscle pathology in a specific disease. In both of these aims, we will evaluate how these new metrics are mirrored in already obtained animal data. In Specific Aim 3, we will study these metrics in a new set of data (a test set) that was not used to develop the analytical paradigms so as to ensure their robustness. With the conclusion of this work, we will plan to pursue a Phase 2 SBIR that will focus on the development of a software suite to assist in EIM data interpretation based upon these results followed by a prospective observational clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of these newly developed metrics for disease diagnosis and tracking of progression/response to therapy. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technology for the assessment of muscle that remains the main focus of Skulpt, Inc.

"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders. The implementation of an evolutionary, system-level model improves our understanding of modern human disease, and, validates existing and novel dietary interventions to lessen their incidence in industrialized societies.",Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease,9248094,R01DK112381,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Agriculture', 'Americas', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Civilization', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evolution', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucose Metabolism Disorders', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Jamaica', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Trinidad', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lipid metabolism', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'nutrition related genetics', 'theories', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIDDK,"J.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,9338285,R01HL115336,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anatomy', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Foot Ulcer', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'accurate diagnosis', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,557344,0.0108150700856119
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies.

"Omics Data Integration to Identify Disease Pathways in COPD Project Summary Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develops chronic airflow limitation and/or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). Using several NIH and foundation grants, we have systematically generated genetic, genomics, proteomic, and metabolomics profiles from the NHLBI supported COPDGene cohort, which includes 10,300 current and former smokers age 45-80. This proposal will focus on integrating the omics data generated in the five-year followup (Phase II) of the COPDgene study to identify molecular subtypes of COPD across a broad range of blood profiles (Specific Aim 1). Biomarkers and pathways discriminating the molecular subtypes, in addition to other COPD phenotypes will then be identified (Specific Aim 2). These results will identify markers that are specific to smoking-related lung disease and can be used to develop novel diagnostic tests and therapies for early prevention and treatment of COPD. Relevance to Public Health Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the United States. The major risk factor is smoking; however, most smokers do not develop COPD and the factors that identify who goes from normal to abnormal lung function are unknown. This proposal will use already collected data on existing NHLBI cohorts to identify blood signatures that can identify who will be at risk for developing smoking related lung disease. The knowledge gained will help guide treatment strategies and improve prognosis assessments.",Omics Data Integration to Identify Disease Pathways in COPD,9440672,R21HL140376,"['Age', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Distal', 'Early treatment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematological Disease', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data space', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genome wide association study', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'metabolomics', 'molecular subtypes', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2017,117278,-0.05085991385913787
"Mechanisms of Increased Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Intradialytic Hypertension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal describes a 5 year training program with the long-term goal of the candidate developing into an independent academic investigator with a research focus in hypertension in patients with chronic and end-stage kidney disease. The candidate will build on a background in clinical research developed during a comprehensive research fellowship spent studying ambulatory blood pressure and endothelial cell dysfunction in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The career development objectives are to obtain skills in designing and conducting prospective clinical research studies, learn statistical models to analyze ambulatory blood pressure in hemodialysis patients, gain experience in measuring and interpreting cardiovascular physiologic parameters including extracellular water and vascular resistance utilizing bioimpedance analysis, and participate in scholarly activities to facilitate te transition into an independent investigator. These will be applied immediately to investigating how extracellular volume and mediators of vascular resistance affect ambulatory blood pressure in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 1 will use a case control design to compare differences in extracellular water in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 2 will determine how extracellular volume, vasoconstrictor mediators of vascular resistance, and vascular resistance itself modify ambulatory blood pressure and the ambulatory blood pressure slope in these two groups. In aim 3, the candidate will gain experience in designing and conducting a randomized trial by comparing the effects of carvedilol vs. prazosin on ambulatory blood pressure, vascular resistance, and mediators of vascular resistance in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The candidate will develop these skills with the support a primary mentor, 3 co-mentors (including one translational research cardiologist and one biostatistician), and a research advisory committee with extensive experience in multiple research disciplines. The candidate and his advisors are located at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, a leading academic medical center with substantial physical and intellectual resources necessary for the career development of young investigators and the performance of cutting-edge research. The candidate will take advantage of numerous courses and research activities as a Clinical Research Scholar in the Department of Clinical Sciences that will promote the overall development of his career. Consistent with the candidate's long term career goals, the findings from this study can be broadened to studying hypertension in hemodialysis patients in general. Understanding the relationship between extracellular volume, vascular resistance, and ambulatory blood pressure will provide the opportunity to investigate how pharmacologic therapies affect each component and how this can improve cardiovascular outcomes in hemodialysis patients.

"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,9443649,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Infant Mortality', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,376620,-0.003156573826905053
"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9307982,R21HL133891,"['Acute', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effector Cell', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'design', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2017,180249,-0.003332031130821703
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

"Software Platform to Stratify Patients for Treatment Arm Randomization in Human Clinical Trials using Patient-Level Predictive Models ABSTRACT Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of brain and spinal cord motor neurons. Since Riluzole was approved in 1995, over 30 late-phase clinical trials have failed and no additional medications have been approved for ALS. While death from ALS averages 3 to 5 years from onset of symptoms, disease progression displays wide heterogeneity. A typical year-long clinical trial can have 20 to 25% of the patients die from the disease while another similar percentage progresses very slowly if at all. Several meta-analyses of ALS trial data indicate that ALS clinical trials are prone to statistical uncertainty and would benefit from tools that increase statistical sensitivity. It is clear that current statistical tools are inadequate to address the drug development challenges posed by this disease and many other diseases that characteristically exhibit high heterogeneity in disease progression. Using the recently available ALS PRO-ACT data set, our team was recently declared a winner of the DREAM Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life Challenge. Since the contest, we have significantly improved the algorithm, built several additional models and begun to create drug development tools. The goal of this grant is to validate our clinical trial randomization tool and develop a prototype interface for use and testing at clinical trial sites. This prototype will serve as a platform for building a suite of tools based on disease progression predictions of individual patients that will eventually be used for drug development in multiple indications. The key innovation of this work, as it applies to randomizing patients for inclusion in different arms of a clinical trial is that it stratifies patients not by a set of features at the beginning of a trial, but rather by predicted outcome at the end of the trial as if patients in the treatment arm had not received the intervention being tested. An improved trial arm balance will provide a better test of the efficacy of the intervention. This work will focus on the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Demonstrate that, compared to traditional randomization strata, randomization strata defined by predictive algorithms significantly improve the balance of outcome features at the end of a trial period. Aim 2: Work with our clinical partner to develop a prototype platform that will enable an ALS predictive algorithm to be used by on-site investigators for randomization in future clinical trials. The randomization tool is the first in a series of planned tools based on patient level disease progression predictions. These tools will radically change the way early ALS clinical trials are enrolled, simulated and analyzed and will enable the development of similar tools, not only for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, but also for multiple other diseases including diabetes, hospital-acquired infections, heart disease and cancer. NARRATIVE This work will develop a prototype to test the use of patient disease progression predictions made by machine learning models as a new way of randomizing clinical trials. The prototype will serve as a platform for the inclusion of a range of drug development tools based on individual patient predictions",Software Platform to Stratify Patients for Treatment Arm Randomization in Human Clinical Trials using Patient-Level Predictive Models,9347506,R43TR002047,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Riluzole', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical sensitivity', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'research and development', 'simulation', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'tool development', 'willingness']",NCATS,"ORIGENT DATA SCIENCES, INC.",R43,2017,224796,-0.009837700865315711
"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,9268794,R01HL126947,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Decitabine', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distal', 'Drug resistance', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hypercellular Bone Marrow', 'Hypermethylation', 'ITGB3 gene', 'Ineffective Hematopoiesis', 'Introns', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'PPBP gene', 'Pancytopenia', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'cytopenia', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'in vivo', 'ineffective therapies', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular marker', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'unnecessary treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,390375,-0.0024125822577261875
"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9241579,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'model building', 'network models', 'novel', 'research study', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,409580,0.005533603013267017
"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome.

There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9084432,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,156324,0.003403440842259703
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,9119862,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Huntington gene', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2016,356244,0.004811056375198033
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.            ",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9081760,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'Work', 'age group', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,428590,0.015946863025132436
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit.

"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,9121614,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Mobility', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker panel', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2016,135270,-0.01754379116544845
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9202982,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2016,1500000,0.0013533228210178291
"A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our work to develop novel algorithms for predictive modeling will for the first time combine results from the use of both metabolomics and proteomics to identify multiple biomarkers that can be used to identify those Hepatitis C (HCV) patients who have developed early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Our long-term goal is to create a non-invasive diagnostic test that is both highly specific and sensitive for the detection of early-stage liver cancer. The overall objective of this project is the creation of a biomarker panel, developed from a predictive model, that can be used for the detection of early-stage HCC. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning algorithms can be used on urine and serum metabolomic data and/or serum proteomic data to create a predictive model for identifying those individuals with HCV that have developed early-stage HCC. The rationale underlying this project is that a combination of metabolites and proteins will yield a highly specific and sensitive predictive model to identify HCV subjects that have developed early stage HCC. Our central hypothesis will be objectively tested by pursuing two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that combining proteomics data with metabolomics data will create a better predictive model for HCC. Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that a biomarker panel consisting of several metabolites and proteins will be more specific and sensitive than either set of data alone. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that combining different types of metabolomics data specific to Stage IV HCV will improve the predictive accuracy of a model for the early detection of HCC. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that by combining results from multiple platforms, we will create a more specific and sensitive predictive model for the early detection of HCC in Stage IV HCV individuals than either platform alone is capable of achieving. This project is significant because it will be the first step towards the early detection of HCC, and will lead to the development of a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for early-stage HCC, and thus to improved patient outcomes and long- term survival. This research is innovative because we are using Stage IV HCV individuals with liver cirrhosis as a control for HCC individuals (as all HCC patients have some amount of cirrhosis), and in using both metabolomics and proteomics on both urine and serum samples from infected patients to identify potential biomarkers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, yet there is no reliable diagnostic test for the early detection of the disease, when treatment options that improve long-term survival and patient outcomes are available. This project is relevant to public health because the discovery of a biomarker panel for the detection of early-stage HCC should ultimately provide new protein and metabolite targets for diagnostic assays to detect HCC in the early stages of the disease. Thus, the research in this project is relevant to that part of NIH's mission which pertains to fostering innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for improving the health of the Nation by conducting research supporting better diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.",A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals,9221078,R03CA211210,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urine', 'Work', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnostic assay', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'model building', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein metabolite', 'research study', 'screening', 'survival outcome', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R03,2016,155000,-0.006381309156477386
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.        ",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,9089492,K99GM118907,"['Adjuvant', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Resistance', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal lavage', 'Phase', 'Phosphorus', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Sulfur', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bactericide', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'counterscreen', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infectious disease treatment', 'insight', 'killings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2016,90000,0.0026264987546315978
"Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood Several million units of donor platelets are transfused annually in the US and Europe to treat patients undergoing radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or organ transplant surgery. Although transfusions of donor- derived platelets are an effective way to treat thrombocytopenic patients, numerous concerns have been raised due to the increase in demand, the five-day shelf-life, and the possibilities for contamination. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow and are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The long-term objective of this proposal is to generate platelets ex vivo from HSPC- enriched umbilical cord blood that will allow us to address a vast public need. Recent studies have shown that the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can greatly affect expansion of progenitor cells, but can reduce MK differentiation efficiency. My central hypothesis is that epigenetic and transcriptional changes prime or desensitize HSPC to MK differentiation cues. To investigate the role of epigenetic signals during HSPC-to- MK transition, I propose to perform high-throughput ChIP and RNA-sequencing to discover differentially active regulatory elements between expanded (low potential) and fresh cord blood HSPCs. This highly interdisciplinary and collaborative proposal utilizes computational biology and machine-learning to identify differentially active regulatory elements, and associate genetic features with MK fate. To validate my findings and establish a causal relationship between histone modifications of certain regions and MK potential, I will generate a dCas9-fusion protein that can directly manipulate the epigenetic marker at a targeted site. My findings will establish the mechanism of action of chromatin-modifying agents such as HDACi, and the causal relationship between the epigenome and MK differentiation. My highly collaborative proposal with the Miller, Bagheri, and Mahmud lab will substantially enhance our understanding of hematopoietic differentiation toward manufacturing platelets. Project Narrative More than two million platelet units from donors are used to treat patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy every year, but short shelf-life, increasing demand, and risk of contamination keep platelets in strained supply. In my proposed study, I will apply a panel of small molecules to expand and differentiate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood into platelet-producing cells. My work will identify the role of epigenetic modifications during the culture process, and elucidate new strategies to efficiently manufacture platelets from culture.",Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood,9195237,F31HL134331,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Computational Biology', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deacetylation', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Europe', 'GATA1 gene', 'GATA2 transcription factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Growth', 'HDAC3 gene', 'HDAC6 gene', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Histones', 'Influentials', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Microtubules', 'Modification', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Tryptophan', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Valproic Acid', 'Work', 'alpha Tubulin', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'high throughput screening', 'histone acetyltransferase', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large scale production', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'sarcoma', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,37571,-0.013493610897515962
"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments. A preliminary diagnosis and qualitative feedback shall also be collected from non-trained GP doctors using the mobile tools in order to ascertain usability and diagnostic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary disease is a very large public health concern in India, as well as in most developing countries. Relatively few general practitioner (GP) doctors are trained to properly diagnose pulmonary disease, and affordable tools for diagnostic support simply do not exist. This proposal seeks to validate and test the use of low-cost mobile phone-based diagnostic tools for pulmonary disease.            ",Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening,9018346,R21TW010245,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Ayurvedic Medicine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biomass', 'Bronchitis', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Cookstove', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Feedback', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Health', 'Household Air Pollution', 'India', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'digital', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meter', 'mobile computing', 'primary care setting', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'tool', 'usability']",FIC,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2016,181365,-0.06212579643775594
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,9094553,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'low income country', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'research study', 'response', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2016,141588,-0.013746546838381692
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",9099895,U01GM110721,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2016,418572,-0.0011221070268177685
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model.

"Optimization of small molecule triazine antituberculars for in vivo efficacy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is due to infection with the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This disease represents a global health pandemic as based on WHO statistics it claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year, while infecting nearly 9 million. New drugs are urgently needed with novel mechanisms of action that treat this disease while also addressing an important need to reduce the lengthy course of treatment that is at best 6 months in duration. We have a primary goal of discovering novel classes of antibacterials. (E)-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)-N2,N4-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2019) [1], was rediscovered by us using Bayesian machine learning models in 2013. It represents a class of antitubercular agents reported only once in 1969 [2]. While JSF-2019 did not exhibit in vivo efficacy in an acute model in our hands, a close analog, ((E)-N2,N4-diisopropyl-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2032) [2] was reported in 1969 to exhibit in vivo activity. Our preliminary data on solubility in PBS, mouse liver microsomal stability, Caco-2 cell permeability, and mouse snapshot pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles demonstrate that the diaminotriazine class of antituberculars holds significant promise for seeding a novel therapeutic. We aim to further improve upon the in vitro efficacy, in vitro Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of these early compounds. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: Utilize medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models to optimize the initial triazine hit family as antitubercular agents. Apply transcriptional profiling nd resistant mutant/whole-genome sequencing methods to identify potential drug targets and mechanism of action of the triazine antitubercular class. Phase I would, therefore, seek to deliver an in vivo active small molecule triazine with information as to potential target/s through complimentary methods. A Phase II program would leverage this information to further optimize this series towards a preclinical candidate of significant interest to foundations and/or biotech/pharmaceutical companies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis represents a global health pandemic, which claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year. Starting from a series of triazines active compounds we will optimize ADME properties to afford a novel in vivo active lead compound by combining our unique expertise in medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models. We will also probe the potential target/s of the triazine series. We will further leverage the exceptional facilities at Rutgers to ultimately lead to a clinical candidate by the end of phas II.",Optimization of small molecule triazine antituberculars for in vivo efficacy,9045992,R41AI122434,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Colony-forming units', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diamines', 'Disease', 'Disease Reservoirs', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Extreme drug resistant tuberculosis', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nitrofurans', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phosphate Buffer', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistance profile', 'Saline', 'Series', 'Solubility', 'South Africa', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Triazines', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'absorption', 'analog', 'aqueous', 'base', 'carbene', 'cytotoxicity', 'diphenyl', 'drug candidate', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'extensive drug resistance', 'genome sequencing', 'global health', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'killings', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'pre-clinical', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'whole genome']",NIAID,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R41,2016,149388,-0.011982819209951156
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9024612,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2016,166104,-0.01273610393528739
"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,9123353,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency response', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'climate data', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'model building', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'skills', 'social media', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2016,107469,-0.0414638409292498
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9145745,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bathing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'micro-total analysis system', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2016,727321,0.006171762401957194
"Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This work seeks to understand whether long non-coding RNAs implicate in the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a form of malignant brain tumors. By characterizing these novel gene regulatory molecules in GBM, we expect to identify novel biomarkers that can be used as a prognostic tool for patients with GBM.

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,9125723,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Taxon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2016,413065,-0.009943227988238868
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,9132205,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,268344,-0.006772426448847574
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,9207183,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Infection', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2016,28614,-0.06728227961177126
"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.            ",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9128230,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Glycosides', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,251130,-0.025573232494202416
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,9088345,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,-0.0039242556642500905

"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies. We use zebrafish as a novel system to investigate the role of the unfolded protein response in fatty liver disease.",The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis,9197415,R01AA018886,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brefeldin A', 'Budgets', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immunoblotting', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Protein Secretion', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tunicamycin', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'acute stress', 'alcohol exposure', 'binge drinking', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'genetic approach', 'health economics', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'liver transplantation', 'loss of function', 'meter', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein folding', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,247500,-0.010679570548085089
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,9116282,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,553894,0.0108150700856119
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.        ",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9108539,U01AI124275,"['Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antimicrobial drug', 'commensal microbes', 'computer studies', 'design', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'immune activation', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'physical symptom', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'research study', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2016,1722908,0.011348567585262335
"Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. These designations of natural history assume great importance at a time when insights from preclinical studies are beginning to translate into therapies targeted at specific key pathways of fibrosis. Stratification of disease phenotypes is important in order to decipher the effects of newly approved therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individual patients.  Various prognostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with overall survival; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good early predictive models exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF from multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier on scans annotated manually by an expert radiologist, analyzing in separate aims static image features present on baseline scans and transitional (difference) morphologic features on sequential scans that herald progressive disease. Features of anatomic distribution will be explored and reproducible imaging features will be expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score. Aggregate prognostic models using Cox proportional regression models will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Finally, we will externally validate our models in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitia Lung Disease Program.  Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that anticipate disease course in patients with IPF. We anticipate that these models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions for the choice in treatment as well as future research to define more homogeneous cohorts for testing new safe and effective therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rates of progression are highly variable, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using newer drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to predict disease course in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns,9122467,R21HL123477,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'Health', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stable Disease', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'functional decline', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2016,107290,-0.020668611963152575
"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9168282,R21HL133891,"['Acute', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effector Cell', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'design', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2016,217444,-0.003332031130821703
"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,9099915,R01HL126947,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Decitabine', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distal', 'Drug resistance', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hypermethylation', 'Ineffective Hematopoiesis', 'Introns', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'PPBP gene', 'Pancytopenia', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'cytopenia', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'in vivo', 'ineffective therapies', 'methylation biomarker', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular marker', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'unnecessary treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,390375,-0.0024125822577261875
"E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A virulent subclone of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131), called ST131-H30, has become the dominant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineage in the US, where it kills thousands of patients each year. Multidrug resistance is a hallmark of ST131-H30-including production of the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-making its clinical management particularly challenging. The ability of ST131-H30 to colonize more frequently and persistently than other strains is thought to be important to its disproportional dis- ease burden. Yet, in our preliminary studies, we have observed that some people fail to become colonized with ST131-H30 despite prolonged household exposure. This strongly suggests that factors other than ST131- H30's intrinsic traits influence colonization. We know that, in the human GI tract, ST131-H30 does not live alone, but rather, as a minor component of a complex microbial community, within which it may be subjected to intense inter- and intra-species competition. In our previous microbiome studies of other body sites, we observed predictable relationships between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. This led us to hypothesize that distinct components of the GI microbiota, including bacteriocin-producing E. coli strains, may competitively exclude ST131-H30. Approach: By leveraging an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 participants, who will contribute > 7,000 fecal specimens, we will conduct two case-control studies to identify the microbiota unique to individuals who remain free of ST131-H30 for 12 months despite ongoing household exposure to ST131-H30 (elite non-colonizers), as compared to individuals with persistent colonization by ST131-H30 for 12 months (elite colonizers) and individuals who newly acquire ST131-H30 during the study (acquirers). We will identify bacterial species most predictive of resistance to ST131-H30 GI colonization using indicator species and decision tree analysis. The decision model will be validated using fecal microbiota data from an additional 300 participants from another cross-sectional survey. To explore intra-species competition, we will identify commensal E. coli strains antagonistic to ST131-H30 using in vitro inhibition assays, and will cross-validate the in vitro results by assessing the antagonistic strains' association with ST131-H30 exclusion using data from the longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts. Innovation: Our approach is innovative in attempting to define mechanisms that influence GI colonization with ST131-H30; its focus on elite non-colonizers; its inter- and intra- species investigation of the microbiome within an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study; and its goal of identifying commensal bacteria antagonistic to a single virulent E. coli subclone. The expected outcome of this study is to identify commensal bacteria that can exclude ST131-H30 from the GI tract. With emerging resistance neutralizing the effectiveness our current antibiotic armamentarium, we must find new ways to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. These results could lead to novel, probiotic strategies for interrupting the transmission of ST131-H30 and future multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to the NIH, NIAID, and public health because it will lay the groundwork for developing novel strategies to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli. Some of the most dangerous kinds of E. coli spread asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tracts of people. In this study, we seek to identify non- pathogenic bacteria that can prevent a deadly new strain of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, called ST131-H30, from colonizing the human gut.",E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome,9020203,R21AI117654,"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Biological Assay', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cystitis', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Price', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Pyelonephritis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'bacteriocin', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'cohort', 'combat', 'commensal microbes', 'fluoroquinolone resistance', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'killings', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic Escherichia coli', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'resistant strain', 'stem', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'urinary']",NIAID,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,181875,-0.0035644689094994396
"Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disorder characterized by unrelenting scarring and stiffening of the lungs that leads to the death of an estimated 34,000 individuals in the U.S. each year. Unfortunately, individuals with IPF have extremely limited treatment options, as no effective drugs have been identified to halt the progression of fibrosis. Despite the importance of collagens to the structural organization both normal and remodeled ECM, little is known about how collagen structure in IPF differs from that of normal tissue architecture. There is a clear need to develop highly specific/sensitive techniques to probe collagen structure and organization in IPF tissues. In this project we will implement new collagen specific analyses using the high resolution microscopy technique of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG). This method is sensitive to both the fibrillar organization and also sub-resolution aspects of macro and supramolecular assembly. Here we will utilize SHG microscopy to: 1) determine the how pathologic collagen organization (seen in IPF) differs from normal tissue; 2) identify and quantify areas of active fibrosis (enriched in collagen III) from ""old"" or mature fibrosis (high in collagen I) in IPF lung specimens; 3) assess changes in elastin and collagen distribution during disease progression; and 4) correlate areas of high collagen III/I signal in IPF histologic samples with clinical markers of disease activity. As part of the project, we will develop customized automated machine vision routines to automatically classify tissues in terms of severity. We will specifically focus all of our efforts on studying structure around fibroblastic foci, which will be identified by other microscope modalities. These foci are thought to be at the leading edge of ECM remodeling but the dynamics of their formation in relationship to the overall fibrotic process remain unclear. We hypothesize that these structural changes will serve as label- free biomarkers of IPF and further hypothesize that the collagen is altered specifically around foci in a manner which is associated with disease progression. The information gained may form the basis of future prognostic/diagnostic schemes. We propose 2 Aims: Aim 1 Polarization resolved SHG to determine distribution of Col I/III and other ECM changes in different stages of IPF.  Aim 2. Develop classification system of morphological changes in IPF visualized by SHG. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Narrative Idiopathic fibrosis (IPF) patients have poor survival rates and there is also a lack of diagnostic/prognostic tools that have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to evaluate changes in collagen in the extracellular matrix.

"Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) affects millions of elderly people in the United States, yet there are no well-established clinical guidelines for assessing a person's relative risk. Accurate assessment of lifetime risk for LOAD would give high-risk individuals the opportunity to undergo regular biomarker screening for signs of disease and to modify environmental risk factors or participate in prospective clinical trials. This Phase I SBIR project aims to develop a risk prediction model for LOAD that meets or exceeds the accuracy standards established in 1998 by the Working Group for Biochemical and Molecular Markers of Alzheimer's Disease. The recent release of whole-genome sequence data from an extensively phenotyped cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative creates a unique opportunity to develop the methodology needed to successfully construct such a risk prediction model. The Parabon team will undertake three specific aims in pursuit of the final goal of producing a risk prediction model that can be used in the clinic. First, a novel methodology will be created for analyzing whole-genome sequence data to discover common SNPs, rare variants, and epistatic interactions that significantly associate with LOAD endophenotypes, the specific physiological changes that underlie disease. This will require innovative algorithm and software development, particularly the implementation of multi-objective optimization in our existing evolutionary search algorithm for detecting epistasis. Second, the discovered significant variants will be built into risk prediction models for each endophenotype using state-of-the-art machine learning methods. These models will then be combined into a single predictive model for lifetime risk, which will be validated in an independent cohort from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. Finally, to quantify the confidence associated with each prediction made by the model, algorithms and software for calculating confidence intervals will be developed and implemented. Each new prediction will be presented with a measure of confidence to enable clinicians to determine what, if any, intervention is necessary. When these aims have been completed, Parabon will have produced the first clinically relevant genetic risk prediction model for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease, as well as a suite of software that can be used in the development of other diagnostics. In Phase II, we will move beyond the ADNI-supplied endophenotypes, using image processing and deep learning to infer neuroimaging features most relevant to AD diagnoses, as well as work to validate the predictive models in a larger, more diverse cohort across multiple sites.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This Phase I SBIR aims to develop a highly accurate predictive model for lifetime risk of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease to enable early identification of high-risk individuals for participation in clinical trials and regular screening for signs of disease.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8849802,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,156324,0.003403440842259703
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression.

"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit. This research takes the first steps towards development of a biomarker-based predictive tool to aid clinicians in treatment decisions.            ",Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection,8987064,R21AI120599,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antitoxins', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Colon', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Loop ileostomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxin', 'Transplantation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'high risk', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'procalcitonin', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'secondary outcome', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2015,232500,-0.02257086586012914
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8929292,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2015,132348,-0.01754379116544845
"New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Candidate: Benjamin Arnold    I am an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my MA in Biostatistics and a PhD in Epidemiology from UC Berkeley in 2009. Since then, I have worked as an epidemiologist in Professor Jack Colford's group. The opportunity to work as the coordinating epidemiologist for a touchstone, multi-country cluster randomized trial - combined with the addition of two children to my family - led me to delay my academic career. I am now ready to restart my career progress toward independent investigator status.     My long-term career goal is to become a leader in the application of novel statistical methods to target and evaluate interventions that reduce the burden of enteric infections and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in low-income countries. This research focus and career objective build from my experience and from a growing collaboration with Dr. Patrick Lammie at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that started in 2013 and has introduced me to seroepidemiologic research. My background in epidemiologic methods, biostatistics, and international field research makes me uniquely qualified to make significant contributions to infectious disease epidemiology at the interface between recent advances in statistical methodology and serological assays.    Environment: University of California, Berkeley    To achieve my career goal, I have developed a training and mentoring plan that focuses on recent advances in statistics (semi-parametric estimation theory and machine learning) and on infectious disease immunology. These are two areas where additional training will open up significant and unique opportunities for me to make meaningful contributions to seroepidemiologic research, and will enable me to launch an independent career as a productive faculty member at UC Berkeley.    I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of senior investigators in biostatistics and immunology to support my training, research, and career objectives. Mark van der Laan (primary mentor, biostatistics) will guide my training in semi-parametric methods and machine learning. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor, biostatistics) will guide my translation of the methodology to applications for enteric pathogens and NTDs. Patrick Lammie (co-mentor at CDC, immunology) will guide my immunology training and research with his expertise in the immunology of enteric pathogens and NTDs    Research: New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission    Background: Recent advances in multiplex antigen assays have led to the development of low-cost and sensitive methods to measure enteric pathogens and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). There have not been commensurate advances in the statistical methods used to derive measures of transmission intensity from antibody response. Translating antibody response into metrics of transmission intensity is a key step from a public health perspective because it enables us to target intervention programs to the populations most in need and then measure the effectiveness of those programs.     Aims and Methods: The overarching goal of this research is to develop a methodologic framework to translate antibody response measured in cross-sectional surveys into measures of transmission intensity for enteric pathogens (7 included in the study, e.g., Cryptosporidium parvum, enterotoxigenic E. coli) and neglected tropical diseases (principal focus: lymphatic filariasis). We approach this goal from two novel perspectives. In Aim 1, we draw on the ""peak shift"" phenomenon for infectious diseases, and hypothesize that changes in transmission will be detectable in the age-specific antibody response curve. At lower transmission, antibody levels should decline across all ages due to fewer and less frequent active infections, leading to an overall shift in the age-specific response curve. We will evaluate the approach by comparing antibody response curves for young children with different exposures (improved vs. unimproved drinking water for enteric pathogens; pre- versus post- mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis) in large, well characterized cohorts in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.     In Aim 2, we will develop semi-parametric methods to estimate the force of infection (seroconversion rate) from seroprevalence data for pathogens where seroreversion is possible, using lymphatic filariasis as an example. Our new approach marks a significant advance over previous work in this area by making few modeling assumptions and by allowing for the flexible control of confounding between comparison groups. We will evaluate the approach in Haiti by measuring the effect of mass drug administration on the force of infection for lymphatic filariasis For all of the methods, we will create user-friendly, open source software to accelerate translation to applied research.     The Future: This mentored training and research plan represents a natural next step for me on a productive and collaborative path to independence at UC Berkeley. It will set the stage for a broader R01-level research portfolio that applies the newly developed methods to primary research studies that evaluate the impact of interventions on enteric infections, and help target and monitor global elimination efforts for NTDs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies measured in blood provide a sensitive measure of infection for many infectious diseases. Statistical methods that enable us to measure disease transmission intensity at the population level from blood antibody levels are an important tool for public health efforts because they help identify populations in greatest need of intervention and help measure the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce transmission. No statistical tools like this exist for enteric pathogens (those that cause diarrhea) and neglected tropical diseases, which together cause an immense health burden among the world's poorest people, and so we propose to develop new methods to measure population-level transmission intensity of these diseases based on antibodies measured in blood from children in Kenya, Tanzania, and Haiti.            ",New Serological Measures of Infectious Disease Transmission Intensity,8947064,K01AI119180,"['Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'California', 'Campylobacter', 'Caregivers', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Future', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Haiti', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Immunology', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kenya', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mumps', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Rubella', 'Running', 'Salmonella', 'Sanitation', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tanzania', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Viral', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'disease transmission', 'drinking water', 'effectiveness measure', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'seroconversion', 'seropositive', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2015,142069,-0.013746546838381692
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",8927659,U01GM110721,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Influenza A Virus', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2015,434391,-0.0011221070268177685
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.            ",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,8860899,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2015,132192,-0.01273610393528739
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health. Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8875053,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,531035,-0.02464084151015369
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.            ",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9019135,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bathing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'micro-total analysis system', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2015,804679,0.006171762401957194
"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.            ",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,8935819,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency response', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Report (account)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'climate data', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'model building', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2015,107469,-0.0414638409292498
"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,8904596,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Taxon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2015,413065,-0.009943227988238868
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8920543,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,335210,-0.006772426448847574
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.            ",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,8954018,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'innovation', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2015,266063,-0.0039242556642500905
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8853788,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virus Diseases', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2015,404827,-0.06728227961177126
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8839318,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,577490,0.0015611035550066451
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8896855,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,542263,0.0108150700856119
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies.

"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.            ",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,8979977,R01HL126947,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Decitabine', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distal', 'Drug resistance', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hypermethylation', 'Ineffective Hematopoiesis', 'Introns', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'PPBP gene', 'Pancytopenia', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'cytopenia', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'in vivo', 'methylation biomarker', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,404125,-0.0024125822577261875
"Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. These designations of natural history assume great importance at a time when insights from preclinical studies are beginning to translate into therapies targeted at specific key pathways of fibrosis. Stratification of disease phenotypes is important in order to decipher the effects of newly approved therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individual patients.  Various prognostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with overall survival; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good early predictive models exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF from multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier on scans annotated manually by an expert radiologist, analyzing in separate aims static image features present on baseline scans and transitional (difference) morphologic features on sequential scans that herald progressive disease. Features of anatomic distribution will be explored and reproducible imaging features will be expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score. Aggregate prognostic models using Cox proportional regression models will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Finally, we will externally validate our models in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitia Lung Disease Program.  Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that anticipate disease course in patients with IPF. We anticipate that these models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions for the choice in treatment as well as future research to define more homogeneous cohorts for testing new safe and effective therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rates of progression are highly variable, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using newer drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to predict disease course in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.            ",Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns,8956609,R21HL123477,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stable Disease', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'digital imaging', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'functional decline', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2015,107290,-0.020668611963152575
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,8925122,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Indium', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RU-486', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,362979,-0.003156573826905053
"E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A virulent subclone of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131), called ST131-H30, has become the dominant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineage in the US, where it kills thousands of patients each year. Multidrug resistance is a hallmark of ST131-H30-including production of the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-making its clinical management particularly challenging. The ability of ST131-H30 to colonize more frequently and persistently than other strains is thought to be important to its disproportional dis- ease burden. Yet, in our preliminary studies, we have observed that some people fail to become colonized with ST131-H30 despite prolonged household exposure. This strongly suggests that factors other than ST131- H30's intrinsic traits influence colonization. We know that, in the human GI tract, ST131-H30 does not live alone, but rather, as a minor component of a complex microbial community, within which it may be subjected to intense inter- and intra-species competition. In our previous microbiome studies of other body sites, we observed predictable relationships between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. This led us to hypothesize that distinct components of the GI microbiota, including bacteriocin-producing E. coli strains, may competitively exclude ST131-H30. Approach: By leveraging an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 participants, who will contribute > 7,000 fecal specimens, we will conduct two case-control studies to identify the microbiota unique to individuals who remain free of ST131-H30 for 12 months despite ongoing household exposure to ST131-H30 (elite non-colonizers), as compared to individuals with persistent colonization by ST131-H30 for 12 months (elite colonizers) and individuals who newly acquire ST131-H30 during the study (acquirers). We will identify bacterial species most predictive of resistance to ST131-H30 GI colonization using indicator species and decision tree analysis. The decision model will be validated using fecal microbiota data from an additional 300 participants from another cross-sectional survey. To explore intra-species competition, we will identify commensal E. coli strains antagonistic to ST131-H30 using in vitro inhibition assays, and will cross-validate the in vitro results by assessing the antagonistic strains' association with ST131-H30 exclusion using data from the longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts. Innovation: Our approach is innovative in attempting to define mechanisms that influence GI colonization with ST131-H30; its focus on elite non-colonizers; its inter- and intra- species investigation of the microbiome within an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study; and its goal of identifying commensal bacteria antagonistic to a single virulent E. coli subclone. The expected outcome of this study is to identify commensal bacteria that can exclude ST131-H30 from the GI tract. With emerging resistance neutralizing the effectiveness our current antibiotic armamentarium, we must find new ways to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. These results could lead to novel, probiotic strategies for interrupting the transmission of ST131-H30 and future multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to the NIH, NIAID, and public health because it will lay the groundwork for developing novel strategies to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli. Some of the most dangerous kinds of E. coli spread asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tracts of people. In this study, we seek to identify non- pathogenic bacteria that can prevent a deadly new strain of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, called ST131-H30, from colonizing the human gut.            ",E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome,8881522,R21AI117654,"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Biological Assay', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cystitis', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Household', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Price', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Pyelonephritis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'bacteriocin', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'cohort', 'combat', 'commensal microbes', 'fluoroquinolone resistance', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'innovation', 'killings', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic Escherichia coli', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'stem', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'urinary']",NIAID,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,236125,-0.0035644689094994396
"Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disorder characterized by unrelenting scarring and stiffening of the lungs that leads to the death of an estimated 34,000 individuals in the U.S. each year. Unfortunately, individuals with IPF have extremely limited treatment options, as no effective drugs have been identified to halt the progression of fibrosis. Despite the importance of collagens to the structural organization both normal and remodeled ECM, little is known about how collagen structure in IPF differs from that of normal tissue architecture. There is a clear need to develop highly specific/sensitive techniques to probe collagen structure and organization in IPF tissues. In this project we will implement new collagen specific analyses using the high resolution microscopy technique of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG). This method is sensitive to both the fibrillar organization and also sub-resolution aspects of macro and supramolecular assembly. Here we will utilize SHG microscopy to: 1) determine the how pathologic collagen organization (seen in IPF) differs from normal tissue; 2) identify and quantify areas of active fibrosis (enriched in collagen III) from ""old"" or mature fibrosis (high in collagen I) in IPF lung specimens; 3) assess changes in elastin and collagen distribution during disease progression; and 4) correlate areas of high collagen III/I signal in IPF histologic samples with clinical markers of disease activity. As part of the project, we will develop customized automated machine vision routines to automatically classify tissues in terms of severity. We will specifically focus all of our efforts on studying structure around fibroblastic foci, which will be identified by other microscope modalities. These foci are thought to be at the leading edge of ECM remodeling but the dynamics of their formation in relationship to the overall fibrotic process remain unclear. We hypothesize that these structural changes will serve as label- free biomarkers of IPF and further hypothesize that the collagen is altered specifically around foci in a manner which is associated with disease progression. The information gained may form the basis of future prognostic/diagnostic schemes. We propose 2 Aims: Aim 1 Polarization resolved SHG to determine distribution of Col I/III and other ECM changes in different stages of IPF.  Aim 2.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8723038,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,156324,0.003403440842259703
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.            ",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8721037,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2014,359539,0.004811056375198033
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications.              PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8700987,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2014,132121,-0.01754379116544845
"Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A mathematical or computational model of infectious disease transmission represents the process of how an infection spreads from one person to another. Such models have a long history within infectious disease epidemiology, and are useful tools for giving insight into the dynamics of epidemics and for evaluating the potential effect of control methods. The overall objective of this project is to substantially improve the methods by which models of infectious diseases transmission are calibrated against biological and disease surveillance data. This will both improve the utility of models as tools for analyzing data on infectious disease outbreaks (for instance to provide more rapid and reliable estimates of how transmissible and lethal a new virus is to public health agencies) and also improve the reliability of models as tools for predicting the likely effect of different interventions (such as vaccines or case isolation) to help policy makers make more informed decisions about control policies. As with many areas of biology and medicine, the data landscape for infectious diseases modeling is changing rapidly. Larger and more complex datasets are becoming available that cover many different aspects of the interaction between a pathogen and the human population: clinical episode data, genetic data about fast-evolving pathogens; animal-model transmission data and community-based representative serological data. The specific aims of our project are to: (a) develop new machine-learning based methods to discover interesting patterns in complex datasets related to the transmission of infectious disease, so as to better specify subsequent mechanistic mathematical or computational models; (b) derive new approaches for using more than one type of data simultaneously to calibrate transmission models and (c) derive new methods of parameter estimation for simulations which model the spatial spread of infection or model both the transmission and genetic evolution of a pathogen. We will achieve these aims in the applied context of research on three key infections: emerging infectious diseases (such as MERS-CoV - the novel coronavirus currently spreading in the Middle East), influenza and Streptococcus pneumonia (a major bacterial pathogen). Examples of the scientific questions we will address that cannot be answered with current methods are: (i) how many unobserved cases of MERS-CoV have occurred so far (to be answered using data on case clusters data, the spatial distribution of cases and viral genetic sequences)? (ii) how many people in different age groups are infected with influenza each year and how does their immune system respond to infection (to be answered using data on case incidence and serological testing of the population)? (iii) how much is vaccination coupled with prescribing practices influencing the emergence of resistant strains of pneumococcus (to be addressed with data on antibiotic and vaccine use, case incidence and bacterial strain frequency)?         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mathematical and computational models of infectious disease spread can provide valuable information to aid policy-makers in the tough choices they face when trying to control infectious diseases, but models must be designed to make the best possible use of the often limited data available. As the digital footprints of our lives grow, so te datasets available for infectious disease models become larger and more complex. This project will develop new algorithms and methods to allow models to make better use of all available data and therefore better inform control policy planning for diseases such as: influenza, pneumococcal infection and novel viruses like MERS-CoV.            ","Models for synthesising molecular, clinical and epidemiological data, and transla",8703195,U01GM110721,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Influenza A Virus', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Movement', 'Natural History', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'contextual factors', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'epidemiological model', 'forest', 'genetic evolution', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel virus', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'seasonal influenza', 'simulation', 'social', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,U OF L IMPERIAL COL OF SCI/TECHNLGY/MED,U01,2014,427668,-0.0011221070268177685
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8708209,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,535841,-0.02464084151015369
"A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am trained as a computational biologist and statistician, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. My main career goal is to become an independent researcher at a major research institution. I plan to continue my current research pursuits in global health and infectious diseases. Specifically, I aim to continue developing mathematical and computational approaches for modeling to understand disease transmission, forecasting future dynamics and evaluating interventions for public policy decisions. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I have had the wonderful opportunity of working with data from multiple sources. Although several of these data streams could be labeled as ""Big Data"", I typically work with the data after it is already processed, filtered and aggregated to a daily or weekly resolution. While I have developed the necessary skills for modeling these already processed data, there are three important areas where I require additional training, mentoring, and experience: (1) advanced computational skills especially in the use of high performance computing and informatics tools, (2) techniques in computational machine learning and data mining necessary for data acquisition and processing, and (3) biostatistical methodology needed for the statistical design of studies involving big data. These three training and mentoring aims would enable me to develop the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in Big Data Science for biomedical research. Boston Children's School and Harvard Medical School are leading institutions in translational biomedical research, thereby making them the ideal environment to pursue the training and research aims in this proposal. The recent emergence of infectious diseases such as the avian influenza H7N9 in China, and re-emergence of diseases such as polio in Syria underscores the importance of strengthening immunization and emergency response programs for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Researchers have developed computational and mathematical models to capture determinants of infectious disease dynamics and identify factors that support prediction of these dynamics, provide estimates of disease risk, and evaluate various intervention scenarios. While these studies have been extremely useful for the understanding of infectious disease transmission and control, most have been disease specific and solely used data from traditional disease surveillance systems. In contrast, there is a huge amount of internet-based data that have been extensively assessed and validated for public health surveillance in the last decade, but it has been scarcely used in conjunction with other data sources for modeling to predict disease spread. Using these novel digital event-based data sources in combination with climate and case data from traditional disease surveillance systems, we will establish a much needed framework for integrating these disparate data sources for modeling to estimate disease risk and forecasting temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. Our approach will be achieved through three aims. The first objective is to develop an automated process for acquiring, processing and filtering data for modeling (Aim 1). Once we gather this data, we will develop temporal models for the dynamical assessment of the relationship between the various data variables and infectious disease incidence (Aim 2). Finally, we will assess the utility of the modeling approaches developed under Aim 2 for forecasting temporal trends of infectious diseases (Aim 3). Through data acquisition, thorough processing, statistical and epidemiological modeling, and guided by advisers with expertise in biomedical informatics, computer science and statistics, we plan to achieve a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data streams for modeling to forecast infectious diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although there have been significant medical and technological advances towards infectious disease prevention, surveillance and control, infectious diseases still account for an estimated 15 million deaths each year worldwide. Reliable forecasts of infectious disease dynamics can influence decisions regarding prioritization of limited resources during outbreaks, optimization of disease interventions and implementation of rigorous surveillance processes for quicker case identification and control of emerging disease outbreaks. Our goal is therefore to develop a data mining/informatics framework that leverages the huge amount of digital event-based data sources in combination with climate data, and data from traditional disease surveillance systems for modeling and forecasting infectious diseases.            ",A Framework for Integrating Multiple Data Sources for Modeling and Forecasting of Infectious Diseases,8829434,K01ES025438,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Boston', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Immunization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention program', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Report (account)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Syndrome', 'Syria', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiological model', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'news', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface']",NIEHS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2014,42469,-0.0414638409292498
"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.

"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8717634,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,371508,-0.006772426448847574
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8841436,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2014,402924,-0.06728227961177126
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.            ",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8695570,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,616625,0.0015611035550066451
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies. We use zebrafish as a novel system to investigate the role of the unfolded protein response in fatty liver disease.            ",The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis,8586243,R01AA018886,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brefeldin A', 'Budgets', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'HIV Infections', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immunoblotting', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Protein Secretion', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tunicamycin', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'acute stress', 'alcohol exposure', 'binge drinking', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'health economics', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'liver transplantation', 'loss of function', 'meter', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein folding', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2014,367264,-0.010679570548085089
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8724239,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,341074,0.0108150700856119
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.            ",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,8766404,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Indium', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RU-486', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,387356,-0.003156573826905053
"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8593988,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,156324,0.003403440842259703
"Probabilistic Disease Surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed research will further develop and evaluate a probabilistic approach to disease surveillance. In this approach, a probabilistic case detection system (CDS) uses Bayesian diagnostic networks to compute the likelihoods of patient findings for each of a set of infectious diseases for every patient in a monitored population. CDS computes these likelihoods from data in electronic medical records, including information derived from free-text reports by natural language processing. CDS makes those estimates available to a probabilistic outbreak detection and characterization component (ODCS).             ODCS also utilizes a Bayesian approach to compute the probability that an outbreak is ongoing for each of a set of infectious diseases of interest, given information from CDS. ODCS also computes probability distributions over the current and future size of a detected outbreak and other characteristics such as incubation period used by public health officials when responding to an outbreak.                        The proposed research will extend the approach, which we have already developed and evaluated for the disease influenza to six additional respiratory infectious diseases. The research will also extend the capabilities of ODCS to utilize non-EMR data, detect an unknown disease, and detect and characterize concurrent outbreaks. The planned evaluations will measure the accuracy of both CDS and ODCS using historical surveillance data from two regions and simulated outbreak data, which we will create by adding outbreak cases generated by an agent-based epidemic simulator to real baseline surveillance data from non-outbreak periods.                        The innovation being advanced by this research is a novel, integrated, Bayesian approach for the early and accurate detection of cases of diseases that threaten health and for the detection and characterization of outbreaks of diseases that threaten public health. The proposed approach has significant potential to improve the information available to public health officials and physicians, which can be expected to improve clinical and public health decision making, and ultimately to improve population health.                  Project Relevance  The proposed research will improve the ability of public health officials and physicians to estimate the current incidence of influenza and other infectious diseases and to predict the future course of epidemics of those diseases. The improved information will better support decisions made by health departments to control epidemics, which is expected to reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic diseases.",Probabilistic Disease Surveillance,8578484,R01LM011370,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Advanced Development', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Topaz', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vaccination', 'advanced system', 'base', 'computer code', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'population health', 'portability', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'surveillance data']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2013,590023,-0.02464084151015369
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.                            ",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,8549818,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Taxon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2013,1235799,-0.009943227988238868
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.            ",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8627692,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2013,321402,-0.006772426448847574
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.          The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.            ",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8580503,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2013,469362,0.0108150700856119
"The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have fatty liver disease (FLD). This is five times the combined incidence of diabetes, viral hepatitis and HIV infection. The initial stages of FLD can be cured with lifestyle changes. However, if even a small percentage of current FLD patients progress to advanced stages, the management of these patients alone will overwhelm clinics, liver transplant waiting lists and health care budgets. There is an urgent need to understand the cellular pathways that contribute to the first step of this disease, accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes (steatosis), so s to design effective therapies to target these pathways. Moreover, in vivo models are needed to test candidate drugs. We use zebrafish larvae to study the genes and pathways that lead to steatosis. One such pathway is the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) which serves as a meter for stress in the secretory pathway. We developed several means of inducing steatosis in zebrafish larvae discovered that UPR activation occurs in all of these. The advantage of using zebrafish for studying the link between the UPR and steatosis include the relatively rapid and inexpensive genetic approaches, large sample size, small animal size and genetic homology to humans. Also, the histopatholgy of fatty liver in zebrafish is very similar to what is seen in patients and it is likely that many of the same pathophysiological mechanisms will contribute to this disease.  We found that while a robust UPR typically causes steatosis, in a moderate UPR does not, and instead, protects against it. The UPR is highly complex, and it is now clear that analysis of isolated metrics of UPR activation is not sufficient to understand how URP activation can alternatively cause or reduce steatosis. We will address this by integrating multiple metrics UPR activation into a system in order to understand their relationships to the outcome of steatosis. This systems biology approach in Aim 1 will allow us to generate a signature of molecular metrics that identify the stressed UPR that is associated with steatosis and the adaptive UPR that protects against it. Once we understand the complex and dynamic nature of the UPR then we can use this to determine how steatosis caused by chronic UPR activation is reduced when one of the key UPR players, Atf6, is depleted whereas steatosis caused by acute UPR activation worsens with Atf6 depletion. In Aim 2 the hypothesis that in chronic UPR activation, Atf6 depletion dials down a 'stressed UPR'. In Aim 3, we will analyze whether Atf6 depletion deprives hepatocytes of the complete reserve of protein folding capacity, accentuating a stressed UPR caused by an acute insult. This work will provide valuable information elucidating the mechanism by which individual UPR components may serve to treat fatty liver disease caused by different etiologies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health, economic impact of fatty liver disease threatens to overwhelm our health care system in the coming decades. There are few treatments for these patients, and there is an urgent need to develop new models to study this disease and to identify potential targets for developing therapies. We use zebrafish as a novel system to investigate the role of the unfolded protein response in fatty liver disease.            ",The impact of the unfolded protein responses on steatosis,8438156,R01AA018886,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Brefeldin A', 'Budgets', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Liver', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'HIV Infections', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immunoblotting', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Larva', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Protein Secretion', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tunicamycin', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'acute stress', 'alcohol exposure', 'binge drinking', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'health economics', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'liver transplantation', 'loss of function', 'meter', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protein folding', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2013,373745,-0.010679570548085089
"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the Hispanic population is growing significantly which is of great concern. In Hispanics, the viral infection progresses more rapidly when compared with Caucasian patients and the treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Disturbingly, current treatments seem to be less effective on Hispanics. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabolomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from patients. We will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create our first order biomarker panels. In phase two, we will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). Dr. Spratt's research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve our SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer vs non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs. n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,8308938,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2012,133197,-0.03168878300348264
"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this STTR project, we present EyeMark, a set of tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy using retinal image photographs. Specifically, we will develop tools for computation of microaneurysm (MA) appearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a biomarker in monitoring progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high positive influence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progression, drug discovery and clinical research. There is ample published evidence that MA turnover rates are a good predictor of likelihood of progression to more severe retinopathy, establishing MA turnover as an excellent biomarker for diabetic retinopathy. Measuring this quantity involves two steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual MAs. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done by entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome the above limitations by automating both the steps involved in MA turnover measurement: accurate image registration, and MA detection. We will develop end-too-end desktop software for automated computation of MA turnover and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor diabetic retinopathy progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed tool will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy patients by providing an automated tool for computation of a biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are more likely to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.              The proposed tool will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy patients by providing an automated tool for computation of a biomarker in a non-invasive manner.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.

"Molecular Genetic Investigation of Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal stem cell disorders characterized by varying degrees of cytopenias, and ineffective and dysplastic hematopoiesis. MDS can be classified as primary de novo MDS with no apparent underlying cause and secondary MDS following congenital or acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) disorders or cytotoxic therapies. Little is known about initiating events leading to pediatric MDS. As a result, no targeted therapies exist and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only therapeutic option.  The heterogeneous clinical and laboratory presentation and limited availability of clinically well-annotated patient samples and in vivo models have posed significant obstacles to study the disease and to identify genetic alterations unique to pediatric MDS. Therefore pediatric MDS remains largely classified by morphologic and cytogenetic criteria that provide few clues as to the molecular basis. Over the last 18 months, we have developed the first nationwide comprehensive Pediatric MDS and BMF Disorder Patient Registry and Tissue Repository now involving 3 institutions and continuing to grow. The registry has collected samples from > 60 individual patients in addition to biological material from 3 unique kindreds with pediatric MDS. These samples form the basis for our first genomic sequencing analysis to gather preliminary data for future experiments and represent the power of this registry to elucidate pathogenic mutations associated with MDS.  Our unique team of investigators will exploit the registry and catalyze our efforts to determine the fundamental underpinnings of pediatric MDS. The team includes David Williams (clinical/translational hematology), Mark Fleming (pediatric hematopathology /hematological genetics), Benjamin Ebert (high throughput genomic technologies in adult MDS) and Kyriacos Markinanos (genetic linkage analysis). We will undertake preliminary studies to demonstrate feasibility, and generate genomic data that will provide the basis for future hypothesis-driven translational and clinical research studies on a national level.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying genetics and pathophysiology of pediatric MDS is poorly understood. By exploiting several well-characterized families with inherited MDS, we will aim to identify the genetic basis for this disorder.  Results obtained not only promise to provide critical insights into the biology of pediatric patients, but will likely increase knowledg into the genetics of adult MDS.              The underlying genetics and pathophysiology of pediatric MDS is poorly understood.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8279285,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2012,105194,-0.010138392710737928
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.               The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections.

"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.              The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone.

"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.           This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,8134899,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2011,134067,-0.03158604075878958
"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.           Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8077374,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2011,105194,-0.010138392710737928
"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,7907646,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2010,131421,-0.03158604075878958
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"Validation of a Vascular Health Profile for Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application address broad challenge area ""(03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" and specific challenge research topic ""03-HL-101* Identify and validate clinically relevant, quantifiable biomarkers of diagnostic and therapeutic responses for blood, vascular, cardiac, and respiratory tract dysfunction."" Treatment paradigms have evolved from studies of patients who, despite similar presentations, may have experienced disparate environmental exposures or clinical courses and may have varied underlying pathobiologies. A developing and exciting biomarker strategy is the measurement of microparticles (MPs) and assessment of circulating progenitor and mature endothelial cells. All eukaryotic cells shed MPs in response to activation or apoptosis and elevation of plasma MPs, particularly those of endothelial origin, reflects cellular injury and is a surrogate marker for vascular dysfunction. Microparticles have been enumerated in a number of conditions where vascular dysfunction and inflammation are important pathophysiological mechanisms, for example coronary artery disease or thrombotic microangiopathies. We recently completed a pilot study evaluating levels of MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and compared flow cytometry results with those of a non cell specific Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assay results correlated with flow cytometry results but did not distinguish the cell of origin where the micoparticle originated. The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate a novel cell-based high throughput, high content, vascular health profile analysis that provides a signature for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events. A unique biocomputational approach at Penn called cytometric fingerprinting will be used to identify populations of cells. The aims are: 1: To develop and validate a single platform high throughput, multiplexed flow cytometry assay for cell specific MPs, endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic progenitors. 2: To develop and validate a cell specific ELISA biomarker assay for MPs in healthy group of subjects and patients with DM and correlate with an independent flow cytometry test for EPCs and HSCs as a dual platform measure of vascular health. 3: To use high order informatics to derive a signature profile from the results of Aims 1 and 2. Such a high throughput high information content approach may prove to be clinically useful in discerning laboratory markers that would be useful for guiding therapy of patients with DM. Penn Medicine contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, Penn Medicine created 37,000 jobs and $5.4 billion in regional economic activity, with the area's highly trained workforce producing more than 24,600 applications for just 840 open Penn staff research positions. The current proposal will create or retain 3 jobs. If successfully validated, the biomarker technology proposed could be commercialized, create thousands of jobs in the health care industry and potentially prevent costly hospital admissions. Also, an ELISA for MPs could provide an early evaluation of impact of novel pharmaceutical compounds on vascular health.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,7675425,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2009,128852,-0.03158604075878958

"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7846704,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'base', 'blind', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein profiling', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2009,19341,-0.0648590822811257
"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% of patients die from complications related to the procedure. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 20-80% of transplant recipients and is the major cause of post transplant non-relapse mortality. While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7648231,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2009,221910,-0.018374920553827112
"Validation of a Vascular Health Profile for Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application address broad challenge area ""(03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation"" and specific challenge research topic ""03-HL-101* Identify and validate clinically relevant, quantifiable biomarkers of diagnostic and therapeutic responses for blood, vascular, cardiac, and respiratory tract dysfunction."" Treatment paradigms have evolved from studies of patients who, despite similar presentations, may have experienced disparate environmental exposures or clinical courses and may have varied underlying pathobiologies. A developing and exciting biomarker strategy is the measurement of microparticles (MPs) and assessment of circulating progenitor and mature endothelial cells. All eukaryotic cells shed MPs in response to activation or apoptosis and elevation of plasma MPs, particularly those of endothelial origin, reflects cellular injury and is a surrogate marker for vascular dysfunction. Microparticles have been enumerated in a number of conditions where vascular dysfunction and inflammation are important pathophysiological mechanisms, for example coronary artery disease or thrombotic microangiopathies. We recently completed a pilot study evaluating levels of MPs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and compared flow cytometry results with those of a non cell specific Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assay results correlated with flow cytometry results but did not distinguish the cell of origin where the micoparticle originated. The overall goal of this study is to develop and validate a novel cell-based high throughput, high content, vascular health profile analysis that provides a signature for individuals at high risk for cardiovascular events. A unique biocomputational approach at Penn called cytometric fingerprinting will be used to identify populations of cells. The aims are: 1: To develop and validate a single platform high throughput, multiplexed flow cytometry assay for cell specific MPs, endothelial progenitor cells and hematopoietic progenitors. 2: To develop and validate a cell specific ELISA biomarker assay for MPs in healthy group of subjects and patients with DM and correlate with an independent flow cytometry test for EPCs and HSCs as a dual platform measure of vascular health. 3: To use high order informatics to derive a signature profile from the results of Aims 1 and 2. Such a high throughput high information content approach may prove to be clinically useful in discerning laboratory markers that would be useful for guiding therapy of patients with DM. Penn Medicine contributes substantially to the local economy.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.              Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs).

"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7367013,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,77600,-0.033032540284207705
"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,7386231,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career', 'experience', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2008,126357,-0.03158604075878958
"Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to investigate the diagnostic precision for detecting glaucoma of clinical electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; and multifocal visual evoked potentials, mfVEP), a technique identified as an important recent glaucoma- related development in eye research by the 2004 National Eye Institute (NEI) National Plan. Aim 1: Electrophysiological responses will be characterized in glaucoma, suspect and healthy eyes and the diagnostic accuracy of these commercially available techniques will be compared to current reference standards (evaluation of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc and standard automated perimetry) and to recently developed diagnostic techniques including optical imaging of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, and scanning laser polarimetry) and visual function-specific perimetry (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency doubling technology perimetry). Aim 2: Novel use of machine learning classifier techniques (e.g. relevance vector machines, support vector machines, mixture of Gaussian techniques, independent components analysis) will be applied to electrophysiological data to improve its diagnostic accuracy and data from different diagnostic techniques (named above) will be combined to improve overall diagnostic accuracy. Aim 3: Electrophysiological measurements will be validated as functional indicators of optic nerve damage by examining the relationship between electrophysiological abnormality and optic disc and RNFL damage in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. 210 patients (105 glaucoma's, 105 glaucoma suspects) and 105 healthy participants will be enrolled and studied cross-sectionally.

"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7501971,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Numbers', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Wasting Syndrome', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2008,136830,-0.0648590822811257
"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms that connect genotype, phenotype and response to therapy in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). LSDs are a family of genetic metabolic diseases caused by lysosomal enzyme deficiencies. In this project we use Fabry disease as a model system to develop a bioinformatics-based paradigm to address two fundamental issues: 1) The relationship between genotype and phenotype in LSDs. This task is challenging because in LSDs different mutations in the same enzyme often lead to different disease phenotypes. 2) The relationship between genotype and response to ""pharmacological chaperone"" therapy. Pharmacological chaperones are small-molecule ligands that are used to rescue mutants, resulting in increased enzymatic activity; several Fabry mutations have been shown to be rescueable in this way. The same therapy is likely to be useful for other LSDs, particularly those with neurological involvement, for which enzyme replacement therapy is not viable. The two aims of this application address, at different levels, both issues described above. The first aim, tests the hypothesis that knowing the change that occurs in the protein sequence, together with the structural environment in which it occurs, is sufficient to predict the resulting disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is tested through the rigorous training of classification methods using sequence and structure-derived descriptors for a large set of Fabry mutants of known phenotype. The resulting classification provides a large- scale quantitative description of the correlation between genotype and phenotype. The accuracy of predictions based on this approach is a measure of how much information about the genotype the descriptors contain. The same approach will be used to establish a quantitative correlation between genotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. Finally, applying the classification methods to mutations in other LSDs will test the generality of the approach. The second aim of this application addresses the issue of genotype/phenotype correlation from a biophysical point of view. We test the hypothesis that a combination of factors, mainly folding free energy, ligand binding affinity, and relative pH stability of the mutants determines the disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is done analyzing selected mutants using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme/ligand and enzyme/receptor interactions, as well as, pH stability, and other calculations. The methods used in the second aim are very detailed, but are not applicable at a large scale. Thus, both aims provide complementary views of genotype/phenotype correlation in LSDs. The successful completion of this project will, for the first time, provide a quantitative connection between genotype and phenotype in LSDs and a detailed biophysical description of the molecular mechanisms underlying genotype/phenotype correlations and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy in Fabry disease. Relevance of this research to public health. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of more than 40 genetic metabolic disorders. Worldwide, the incidence of patients with LSDs is estimated to be ~ 1 in 8,000 live births. Understanding the correlation between genotype, phenotype, and response to treatment in these diseases will help in their diagnosis and treatment, particularly for LSDs that affect the brain, for which no effective treatment is available to date.          n/a",Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases,7388981,R21DK078345,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fabry Disease', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Galactosidase', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Live Birth', 'Lysosomal Storage Diseases', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'enzyme deficiency', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'enzyme structure', 'enzyme substrate', 'family genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein degradation', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'three dimensional structure']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2008,124583,-0.009524766144536498
"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,7510774,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Rural Community', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2008,94531,-0.010138392710737928
"A Gene Expression Based Blood Test for Rheumatic Disease Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Clinical dilemma: Recent advances in biologic therapies for rheumatic diseases provide a means for more profound disease management. Proper diagnosis is a necessary aspect of choosing the proper biologic therapy. While disease diagnosis, based on clinical findings and laboratory tests, is effective in a significant number of patients, it can be problematic in patients with early disease, mild symptoms, or unclear presentation, leading to delayed or inappropriate treatment with poor patient outcomes and/or exposures to unnecessary drug toxicities. This problem is due in part to limitations of specificity and sensitivity of current rheumatology diagnostic laboratory tests. Many of these tests are designed to include or rule out one disease, which may be inadequate to obtain a diagnosis if the results are negative. Our preliminary data suggest that a single blood test can be developed which is capable of sensitive and specific disease diagnosis of many common rheumatic diseases using gene expression profiling of peripheral blood. We also have data suggesting that this multi-disease test is effective in patients with early disease prior to full clinical differentiation and may aid in guiding earlier treatment which can dramatically improve outcomes.   Approach: To assess the potential of gene expression-based diagnostic testing, clinical samples were collected from a cohort of patients with definitive forms of inflammatory disease, and broad-based gene expression profiling was performed. Multivariate algorithms identified 38 genes that distinguished controls and the four inflammatory diseases tested with high specificity and sensitivity. We have subsequently collected RNA from a second larger patient cohort with sufficient size to power a study to distinguish among a set of rheumatic diseases that can be difficult to distinguish, namely rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ankylosing spondylitis. Biostatistical analyses of gene expression profiles will allow us to translate these findings into two high throughput clinical tests, the first based on gene expression results and the second based on serum protein biomarkers. Finally, we will assess the prognostic power of gene expression profiling by examining results from patients early in their disease cycle with undifferentiated arthritis to determine who is likely to develop erosive disease and who is likely to go into remission. These findings will allow physicians to use more proactive forms of therapy in early undifferentiated arthritis to delay onset of erosive disease and to use less expensive drugs with fewer side effects for patients that are likely to remit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will identify novel blood markers (biomarkers) for some of the more common forms of rheumatic diseases.  These biomarkers will be used by physicians to accurately diagnose these diseases and to help distinguish patients who are more likely to develop severe forms of disease from those likely to go into remission.  Earlier diagnosis and treatment are linked to better outcome in patients.       n/a",A Gene Expression Based Blood Test for Rheumatic Disease Diagnosis,7394136,R43AR055855,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Ankylosing spondylitis', 'Arthritis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease regression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Serum Proteins', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Undifferentiated', 'base', 'cohort', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prognostic', 'response', 'size', 'tool']",NIAMS,"CRESCENDO BIOSCIENCE, INC.",R43,2008,147000,-0.028514059369804202
"Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), namely ulcerative colitis (DC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, lifelong, relapsing illnesses, affecting close to 1 million Americans. Despite the many clues that a dysbiosis may exist in IBD, the specific changes in the microflora of IBD patients are largely unknown. Amplicon length heterogeneity (ALH) is a sophisticated and well established PCR based technology that can be used as a screening tool to identify changes in the Bacterial microflora of IBD patients. We therefore have hypothesized that the ileocolonic microflora in IBD has an altered microbial composition compared to normal microflora. We have gathered preliminary data that shows statistical differences between controls and IBD as well as within IBD patients. Therefore, to test the above hypothesis, we are proposing the following 2 inter-related scientific aims: AIM 1. Identify bacterial fingerprint patterns associated with IBD using ALH. ALH patterns will be determined in a total of 160 IBD patients and health controls and will be analyzed using diversity indeces, multivariate reduction analysis and cluster analysis. ALH patterns associated with IBD will be determined using histograms, ecological software in conjunction with custom PERL scripts as well as supervised and unsupervised automated pattern recognition systems. AIM 2.Determine the bacterial contents of putatively IBD associated ALH fingerprint patterns using molecular cloning and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of targeted samples will be linked to bacterial identities by employing multiple bioinformatics tools. Significance. This proposal involves the first time use of a sophisticated and highly reproducible molecular biology tool, ALH, in the study of microflora in the Gl tract. There is a growing recognition of the importance of microflora in health and disease, including IBD. Studies that characterized microflora in human using powerful techniques from environmental microbiology such as ALH can bring about significant advances in the understanding of Gl tract illnesses. ALH may enable a real-time survey of microfloral changes for the first time in medicine and may provide the first evidence linking IBD with specific microbial patterns.           n/a",Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7434510,R21DK071838,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bispecific Antibody 2B1', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal part of ileum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Feces', 'Fingerprint', 'Flare', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Soil', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visual', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disabling disease', 'ileum', 'indexing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prebiotics', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIDDK,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2008,181300,0.009462460743271263
"Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% of patients die from complications related to the procedure. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 20-80% of transplant recipients and is the major cause of post transplant non-relapse mortality. While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7509654,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2008,188750,-0.018374920553827112

"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7265522,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,77600,-0.033032540284207705
"Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to investigate the diagnostic precision for detecting glaucoma of clinical electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; and multifocal visual evoked potentials, mfVEP), a technique identified as an important recent glaucoma- related development in eye research by the 2004 National Eye Institute (NEI) National Plan. Aim 1: Electrophysiological responses will be characterized in glaucoma, suspect and healthy eyes and the diagnostic accuracy of these commercially available techniques will be compared to current reference standards (evaluation of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc and standard automated perimetry) and to recently developed diagnostic techniques including optical imaging of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, and scanning laser polarimetry) and visual function-specific perimetry (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency doubling technology perimetry). Aim 2: Novel use of machine learning classifier techniques (e.g. relevance vector machines, support vector machines, mixture of Gaussian techniques, independent components analysis) will be applied to electrophysiological data to improve its diagnostic accuracy and data from different diagnostic techniques (named above) will be combined to improve overall diagnostic accuracy. Aim 3: Electrophysiological measurements will be validated as functional indicators of optic nerve damage by examining the relationship between electrophysiological abnormality and optic disc and RNFL damage in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. 210 patients (105 glaucoma's, 105 glaucoma suspects) and 105 healthy participants will be enrolled and studied cross-sectionally. The specific aims of this proposal address the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset, determining functional correlates of optic nerve damage, and characterizing glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. Information about the relative usefulness of electrophysiological measurement, optical imaging techniques, and ganglion cell-specific perimetry for glaucoma detection is important to the clinical community for determining future evidence-based changes in standard of care for glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring.

"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7313388,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Numbers', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Wasting Syndrome', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2007,223880,-0.0648590822811257
"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms that connect genotype, phenotype and response to therapy in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). LSDs are a family of genetic metabolic diseases caused by lysosomal enzyme deficiencies. In this project we use Fabry disease as a model system to develop a bioinformatics-based paradigm to address two fundamental issues: 1) The relationship between genotype and phenotype in LSDs. This task is challenging because in LSDs different mutations in the same enzyme often lead to different disease phenotypes. 2) The relationship between genotype and response to ""pharmacological chaperone"" therapy. Pharmacological chaperones are small-molecule ligands that are used to rescue mutants, resulting in increased enzymatic activity; several Fabry mutations have been shown to be rescueable in this way. The same therapy is likely to be useful for other LSDs, particularly those with neurological involvement, for which enzyme replacement therapy is not viable. The two aims of this application address, at different levels, both issues described above. The first aim, tests the hypothesis that knowing the change that occurs in the protein sequence, together with the structural environment in which it occurs, is sufficient to predict the resulting disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is tested through the rigorous training of classification methods using sequence and structure-derived descriptors for a large set of Fabry mutants of known phenotype. The resulting classification provides a large- scale quantitative description of the correlation between genotype and phenotype. The accuracy of predictions based on this approach is a measure of how much information about the genotype the descriptors contain. The same approach will be used to establish a quantitative correlation between genotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. Finally, applying the classification methods to mutations in other LSDs will test the generality of the approach. The second aim of this application addresses the issue of genotype/phenotype correlation from a biophysical point of view. We test the hypothesis that a combination of factors, mainly folding free energy, ligand binding affinity, and relative pH stability of the mutants determines the disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is done analyzing selected mutants using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme/ligand and enzyme/receptor interactions, as well as, pH stability, and other calculations. The methods used in the second aim are very detailed, but are not applicable at a large scale. Thus, both aims provide complementary views of genotype/phenotype correlation in LSDs. The successful completion of this project will, for the first time, provide a quantitative connection between genotype and phenotype in LSDs and a detailed biophysical description of the molecular mechanisms underlying genotype/phenotype correlations and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy in Fabry disease. Relevance of this research to public health. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of more than 40 genetic metabolic disorders. Worldwide, the incidence of patients with LSDs is estimated to be ~ 1 in 8,000 live births. Understanding the correlation between genotype, phenotype, and response to treatment in these diseases will help in their diagnosis and treatment, particularly for LSDs that affect the brain, for which no effective treatment is available to date.          n/a",Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases,7239204,R21DK078345,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fabry Disease', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Galactosidase', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Live Birth', 'Lysosomal Storage Diseases', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'enzyme deficiency', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'enzyme structure', 'enzyme substrate', 'family genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein degradation', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'three dimensional structure']",NIDDK,MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2007,127125,-0.009524766144536498
"Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), namely ulcerative colitis (DC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, lifelong, relapsing illnesses, affecting close to 1 million Americans. Despite the many clues that a dysbiosis may exist in IBD, the specific changes in the microflora of IBD patients are largely unknown. Amplicon length heterogeneity (ALH) is a sophisticated and well established PCR based technology that can be used as a screening tool to identify changes in the Bacterial microflora of IBD patients. We therefore have hypothesized that the ileocolonic microflora in IBD has an altered microbial composition compared to normal microflora. We have gathered preliminary data that shows statistical differences between controls and IBD as well as within IBD patients. Therefore, to test the above hypothesis, we are proposing the following 2 inter-related scientific aims: AIM 1. Identify bacterial fingerprint patterns associated with IBD using ALH. ALH patterns will be determined in a total of 160 IBD patients and health controls and will be analyzed using diversity indeces, multivariate reduction analysis and cluster analysis. ALH patterns associated with IBD will be determined using histograms, ecological software in conjunction with custom PERL scripts as well as supervised and unsupervised automated pattern recognition systems. AIM 2.Determine the bacterial contents of putatively IBD associated ALH fingerprint patterns using molecular cloning and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of targeted samples will be linked to bacterial identities by employing multiple bioinformatics tools. Significance. This proposal involves the first time use of a sophisticated and highly reproducible molecular biology tool, ALH, in the study of microflora in the Gl tract. There is a growing recognition of the importance of microflora in health and disease, including IBD. Studies that characterized microflora in human using powerful techniques from environmental microbiology such as ALH can bring about significant advances in the understanding of Gl tract illnesses. ALH may enable a real-time survey of microfloral changes for the first time in medicine and may provide the first evidence linking IBD with specific microbial patterns.           n/a",Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7197734,R21DK071838,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bispecific Antibody 2B1', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal part of ileum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Feces', 'Fingerprint', 'Flare', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Soil', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visual', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disabling disease', 'ileum', 'indexing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prebiotics', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIDDK,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2007,222000,0.009462460743271263
"The BioSense Initiative to Improve Early Event Detection RTI International, in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), and in collaboration with the North Carolina Division of Public Health (NC-DPH), is submitting this application to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to improve early detection of disease outbreaks of public health significance. Rapid detection of disease outbreaks rests on a foundation of accurate classification of patient symptoms early in the course of their illness. The overarching objective of this research is to define, evaluate, and standardize a methodology for creating useful case definitions designed for the early detection of intentional and naturally occurring disease outbreaks. The specific aim of this research proposal is to develop and test methods for increasing the sensitivity and specificity of syndrome definitions using timely emergency department data. Improved case definitions will enhance CDC's capacity to detect and investigate threats to the health of the population, which CDC undertakes as part of its mission. Emergency department data may serve as a rich source for early signals of health threats to the population, but case definitions have not been standardized, and new methods are needed to process and use the textual information found within the emergency record. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative and iterative research plan that leverages RTI's and UNC-CH's capabilities to best serveCDC and the public health community. We will use emergency department data captured through North Carolina's Bioterrorism and Emerging Infections PreventiveService, the operational syndromic surveillance system used by NC-DPH to monitor the state. After (1) developing a gold standard data set of ED visits for evaluating syndrometest characteristics, we will (2) evaluate natural language processing for preprocessing chief complaints; (3) explore use of semantic networking tools for developing definitions; (4) apply a reverse engineering process using ICD-9-CMcode groupings; and (5) assess the applicability of early event detection for creating situational awareness following detection of an event. These methods will make use of information within the emergency record and create syndrome definitions with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and positisve predictive value. Valid syndromedefinitions will enable public health officials to operate a national monitoring system that can automatically detect signals that may represent disease outbreaks or other potential threats to health.

"Development of rapid detection tests for Brucella species    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brucellosis is a re-emerging zoonotic disease that affects humans and a variety of farm animals. As well as a threat to public health it has considerable economic importance. The etiologic agent responsible for human infection, Brucella melitensis, is classified by both NIAID and CDC as a Category B biothreat pathogen. Antibiotics are only partially effective at controlling the disease and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans. Thus, prompt and accurate diagnosis is the key to containing infection. Currently, the most common diagnostic tests for Brucella are based on indirect serology which are lacking in specificity and sensitivity as well as speed of execution. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved diagnostics, especially technologies that may be used at field level. This investigation proposes to address this issue and develop a superior and robust technique for diagnosing Brucella infection with highly specific, non-cross reactive antibody reactions. We will achieve this goal by screening the Brucella genome using novel proteomic chip technology to identify unique antigens that will yield highly specific and accurate diagnoses. This work will be undertaken in Phase 1 of the application. In Phase 2, when antigens have been selected, we anticipate that we will proceed to develop ELISA and immunoblot assays. In parallel, both ELISA and lateral flow ""dipstick"" tests for Brucella antigen will be constructed. We envisage that the antigen assays will have particular utility in detecting Brucella disseminated in the context of the bioterrorism event. The diagnostic tools developed within this application will be rigorously evaluated for sensitivity and specificity using large and diverse panels of human and animal Brucella-positive sera available through our collaborators. The project proposes to develop a highly sensitive and robust diagnostic test for brucellosis, also known as ""undulant fever"", an infectious disease that causes serious illness in farm animals and humans. The current techniques for diagnosing infection are somewhat unreliable and based on outmoded methods. This investigation will use state- of-the-art technology to identify new structures or antigens on Brucella bacteria that may be used to develop a test with superior diagnostic performance.          n/a",Development of rapid detection tests for Brucella species,7278655,R43AI068166,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Bioterrorism', 'Brucella', 'Brucella abortus', 'Brucella melitensis', 'Brucellosis', 'Categories', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunodominant Antigens', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Livestock', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Printing', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serum', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Study of serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'Yersinia enterocolitica', 'base', 'biothreat', 'disorder control', 'improved', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'response', 'tool']",NIAID,"INBIOS INTERNATIONAL, INC.",R43,2007,278818,0.012657339219086175
"RESEARCH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA-- RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DESCRIPTION: (adapted from the applicant?s abstract): Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common problems in the general population. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for TMD were developed to establish specific operationalized examination procedures and diagnostic criteria for 8 Axis I biomedical diagnoses of TMD, as well as Axis II biobehavioral assessment procedures. Procedural reliability testing has been established for the RDC Axis I examination items, but full acceptance of the RDC requires confirmation of the temporal stability, validity, generalizability and clinical utility of the examination items, biomedical diagnoses, biobehavioral assessments, and general protocol. In order to accomplish these overall goals, a multi-center project is proposed that will first reassess at the University of Minnesota the reliability of 6 examiners (2 examiners each from 3 participating universities) to collect clinical Axis I examination data using the RDC operational definitions. In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI.

"Osteoporosis in Hypercalciuric Kidney Stone Formers The aim of our research is to determine the risk of bone disease in hypercalciuric kidney stone formers and their families by establishing an algorithm that takes into account bone mineral density (BMD), demographic characteristics diet history, and urine and serum chemistries, including markers of bone turnover. The algorithm will allow us to determine which hypercalciurics need clinical evaluation for osteoporosis and will form the basis of a disease management product. In the process of creating this algorithm, we will be the first to determine the prevalence of bone disease in hypercalciuric stone formers and their families and over time make some estimates of incidence rates. A longer- term goal of our research is to study the genetic underpinnings of osteoporosis and nephrolithasis in these families.

In a second step, reliable blinded examiners will collect clinical examination data and formulate RDC diagnoses, which will be compared to criterion diagnoses made by an expert imaging. New clinical exam items will also be assessed. Subject to expert consensus, they will be added to yield a final exam protocol that will include all current RDC examination items as well as the new items. With this new protocol, the 6 examiners will continue examining normal and TMD subjects at their respective centers in order to test the temporal stability and diagnostic validity of the new and existing examination items, patient history items, and TMJ imaging by plain film and MRI.

"RULE DISCOVERY IN BODY CAVITY EFFUSIONS  DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             Machine learning methods are innovative tools used to find patterns in medical       data.  Laboratory data is suited to computerized Interpretation because of its       objective, quantitative nature.  Body fluid analysis is a good model for             evaluating machine learning in the laboratory.  Pathologists spend a                 substantial amount of time analyzing and classifying body fluids, or                 effusions, which are abnormal accumulations of fluid within body cavities of         human beings and animals, caused by diseases such as congestive heart failure.       Fluid classification provides clinicians with important diagnostic information       about the underlying disease process.  Automation of body fluid analysis by a        machine learning system would substantially increase the efficiency and              profitability of a medical laboratory.  In a pilot study, RIPPER (Repeated           Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction), a rule discovery tool,              accurately classified effusions from animals into five standard categories,          based on the physical, chemical, and cellular characteristics of the fluid.          The purposes of this study are: 1) to determine the accuracy of RIPPER on a          larger data set, to expand and strengthen the results of the pilot; 2) to test       the accuracy of RIPPER's fluid classifications prospectively in a large              veterinary teaching hospital laboratory, 3) to determine the acceptance rate         or reason for rejection of RIPPER's classification by clinical pathologists;         and (4) to use RIPPER to discover novel rules for classifying effusions by           underlying disease process.                                                                                                                                               The results of this study will validate and test the acceptance of a machine         learning system applicable to fluid analysis in both human and veterinary            clinical laboratories.

"Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning Project Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals. Currently there are no proven effective therapies for treatment of advanced non-neovascular AMD, termed geographic atrophy (GA). Earlier intervention may be preferable, but this would require identification of those individuals with the highest risk for progression to atrophy. Over the last two decades, various studies including ours have identified several optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based factors that appear to associate with a higher risk for AMD progression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important risk factors, yielding a better prediction of AMD progression risk than current subjectively specified features. In this proposal, we will first develop an AI- based system to automatically identify the “subjectively-specified” high risk factors based on individual spectral domain (SD) OCT 2D scans, and to automatically segment GA (the end-stage outcome variable of AMD) in OCT 2D en face maps. Subsequently, as a proof-of-concept study of our hypothesis, we will apply an AI-based “reverse learning” approach to objectively learn and identify AMD high risk factors in longitudinal OCT data. To achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate an AI approach to classify individual OCT 2D scans as containing or not containing the pre-specified risk factor(s). In our previous work, we manually identified the presence or absence of the pre-specific high-risk factors and assigned to a risk score based on the entire OCT volume. Such approach was time consuming and not precise. In this proposal, an AI algorithm will be applied to detect the high risk factors from individual OCT scans. Hence, the precision of the scoring system can be greatly enhanced with high computational complexity. Aim 2: Develop and validate an AI approach to segment GA lesions from 2D OCT en face maps. For the OCT volumes having atrophy, we will perform the GA segmentation from the choroidal hypertransmission-resulted en face map using the multi-scale CNNs. Aim 3: Develop and validate an AI “reverse learning” approach to objectively identify the high risk factors using longitudinal OCT data. The “reverse learning” will be based on the multiple CNNs, followed by de- convolutional networks to identify the high risk factors objectively. Our previous scoring system will possibly be refined and optimized by the potential inclusion (or substitution) of novel risk factors derived from our objective AI approaches. The work in this proposal will be performed retrospectively in SD-OCT images from the image data pool that the multi-PI Sadda has aggregated over years as the director of the Doheny image reading center. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals and it may be preferable to intervene at an earlier stage in the disease process. We propose to use artificial intelligence techniques to automatically and objectively identify and quantify end-stage atrophy as well to identify the features on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which are associated with a higher risk for progression to late atrophic AMD.

"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving, yet the donor organ shortage and high organ discard rate contributes to 13 deaths daily among patients awaiting transplant. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on microscopic quantitation of chronic damage by pathologists. The current standard of care relies on a manual process that is subject to significant human variability and inefficiency, resulting in potentially healthy kidneys being discarded and potentially damaged kidneys being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model to quantify percent global glomerulosclerosis in donor kidney frozen section biopsy whole slide images. We developed a cloud-based platform to apply the Deep Learning model to analyze kidney biopsy whole slide images in under 6 minutes with accuracy and precision equal to or greater than current standard of care pathologists. We have also developed a Deep Learning model to quantify interstitial fibrosis on donor kidney biopsy whole slide images. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, improved patient outcomes, and diminished health care costs. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated techniques as the standard for evaluating donor kidneys prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the interstitial fibrosis Deep Learning model, use the automated quantitation of key microscopic findings to develop an outcome-based chronic damage score that predicts graft outcome, and test the ability of the Deep Learning models to withstand variations encountered using different scanners and processing in different laboratories. The functionality of the Trusted Kidney software platform will be improved beyond the current usable product into a commercially viable solution for multiple laboratories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Before kidneys can be transplanted, they must be examined using a microscope to ensure the kidney is healthy enough for transplant. A limitation of microscopic examination by pathologists is the inherent human variability in quantifying the amount of scar tissue, or chronic damage, present. The result is potentially healthy organs being discarded or damaged kidneys being used inappropriately. This funding will support developing artificial intelligence tools to assist pathologists with quantifying scar tissue in donor kidneys prior to transplantation, resulting in more consistent and objective biopsy evaluations, minimizing discard of potentially healthy kidneys, and optimizing placement of kidneys for transplant.",A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies,10138826,R42DK120253,"['Adoption', 'Americas', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Canada', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Fibrosis', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graft Survival', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Midwestern United States', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Procurements', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Trichrome stain', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Trust', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'functional improvement', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'pathology imaging', 'phase 1 study', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'renal damage', 'shared database', 'standard of care', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NIDDK,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R42,2020,811695,-0.0013798405620803972
"Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies PROJECT SUMMARY Viral hepatitis from hepatitis B (HBV) establishes chronic infections in >250M people worldwide; chronicity is on the rise, and approximately one-third of the world’s population (2 billion) has serologic evidence of exposure. HBV coinfection with HCV and HIV is a hidden consequence of the substance use disorder epidemic. Viral populations have extremely high sequence diversity and rapidly evolve, which explains the vaccine failure rates and viral resistance to existing therapies and makes discovering lasting therapies extremely challenging. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is the method of choice to assess the intra-host virus population, termed a “quasispecies”. While a large set of short DNA sequencing reads are acquired that represent the virions in the quasispecies, computational technologies are limited in their analysis capabilities, resulting in particularly low resolution of complex HBV genomic structures. Another challenge is assembling NGS reads representing short fragment of the host genome into full strains (haplotypes) without knowledge of their true occurrence in the samples. To meet these challenges, GATACA is developing pathogen-specific bioinformatics software, GAT-ML (GATACA Assembly Tool – machine learning [ML]) to support treatment discovery and improve infection control. Its specifically designed algorithm utilizes novel ML methodologies adapted and modified for assisting genome assembly that will allow GAT-ML to reconstruct complete viral haplotypes and populations by learning the ‘language’ of the sequences. Tailored initially for HBV samples, GAT and its new ML system will be integrated for feasibility testing in this Phase I with the following Specific Aims: 1. Specific Aim 1. Build a joint learning system. Train and test natural language processing (NLP) methods on HBV genetic variation. 2. Specific Aim 2. Implement and test the machine learning methods in GAT (GAT-ML). We anticipate a working tool for characterizing HBV haplotypes, validated with multi-sourced datasets, and extensive testing and benchmarking of offline and integrated methods. The proposed project will develop and increase the capabilities of our novel computational tool, GAT, to help researchers identify the full spectrum of genetic features of a viral population—such as emergence and persistence of resistance or baseline polymorphisms regardless of their frequencies—and translate these findings to the development of new or improved antiviral drugs and other applications requiring high analytic sensitivity.

"Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy Project Abstract Stargardt disease is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a widely available imaging technique which may aid in the diagnosis of Stargardt disease and is commonly used to monitor its progression. FAF imaging provides an in vivo assay of the retinal layers, but is only an indirect measure. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), in contrast, provides three-dimensional visualization of the retinal microstructure, thereby allowing it to be assessed directly and individually in eyes with Stargardt disease. At a retinal disease endpoints meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November of 2016, a reliable measure of the anatomic status of the integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the retina, was proposed to be a potential suitable regulatory endpoint for therapeutic intervention clinical trials. Manual segmentation/identification of the EZ band, particularly in 3-D OCT images, has proven to be extremely tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Automated objective segmentation techniques, such as an approach using a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct, would be of significant value. Moreover, Stargardt disease may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. Thus, this proposal develops an AI-based approach for automated Stargardt atrophy segmentation and the prediction of atrophy progression in FAF and OCT images. More specifically, we first register the longitudinal FAF and OCT enface images respectively, and register the cross-sectional FAF to OCT image. We then develop a 2-D approach for Stargardt atrophy segmentation from FAF images using an AI approach and a 3-D approach for EZ band segmentation from OCT images using a 3-D graph-based approach. Finally, an AI-based approach is developed to predict subsequent development of new Stargardt atrophy or progression of existing atrophy from the OCT EZ band thickness and intensity features of the current patient visit. Project Narrative Stargardt disease is an inherited juvenile-onset macular dystrophy that may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials.

"Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at managing the optimal care for individual cases due to difficulties of accurately assessing the potential progression and its speed and magnitude. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large inter-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we propose novel agnostic data-driven deep learning approaches to detect glaucoma and accurately forecast its progression that are optimized to each individual case. We will use state- of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. Instead of relying on the conventional knowledge-based approaches (e.g. quantifying tissues known to be significantly associated with glaucoma such as retinal nerve fiber layer), the proposed cutting-edge agnostic deep learning approaches determine the features responsible for future structural and functional changes out of thousands of features autonomously by learning from the provided large longitudinal dataset. This program will advance the use of structural and functional information obtained in the clinics with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma. Furthermore, the developed methods have potentials to be applied to various clinical applications beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology. Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies using agnostic deep learning approaches that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression forecasting and monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes,9864905,R01EY030929,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Retina', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'analytical method', 'base', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'falls', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'ocular imaging', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,400056,-0.005601966030506904
"Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction: PhotoniCare, Inc. is a medical device company developing the TOMi Scope, a handheld, optical imaging device for improved diagnosis of middle ear health. The purpose of this proposal is to establish and evaluate a machine learning approach to facilitate both: (1) ease and reliability of quality data capture in a pediatric population from users with a range of otscopy expertise, and; (2) assist interpretation of the TOMi Scope’s correlated otoscopy and depth-resolved images in order to enable improved diagnostic accuracy and, ultimately, effective management. Significance: Ear infections affect 93% of all children, yet they are one of the most poorly diagnosed (~50% accuracy) and managed diseases in all of medicine, resulting in high antimicrobial over-prescription and resistance development. Correctly identifying the absence or presence/type of middle ear effusion (MEE; fluid) through the non-transparent eardrum is critical to accurate diagnosis, and the limited current diagnostic tools suffer poor diagnostic adoption (7-38% reported use) and accuracy (50-70%) due to inherent subjectivity and dependence on user expertise. Therefore, there is a clear and unmet need for superior, objective screening, starting with a definitive yet easily and reliably usable diagnostic tool for this extremely prevalent yet poorly managed disease. Hypothesis: Applying a machine learning approach to TOMi Scope imaging guidance and diagnostic classification will facilitate both: 1) ease-of-use and reliable quality data collection improvement, and 2) accurate detection of the presence or absence of MEE, as well as classification of the type of infection, regardless of user experience. Specific Aims: (1) Collect labeled TOMi Scope data (otoscopy and depth-scan images) from 268 patients at pediatric offices affiliated with UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, (2) Achieve reliable usability of the TOMi Scope by guiding image capture using TOMi-net, a deep learning model, (3) Develop a multimodal deep learning model to provide diagnostic assistance using TOMi Scope otoscopy and depth-scan data. Commercial Opportunity: The TOMi Scope will provide physicians with a superior user experience and new, objective information, enabling better decision-making for antibiotic prescription and surgical intervention. This has the potential to impact the standard of care for ~1B children worldwide that experience ear infections, representing a multi-billion-dollar commercial opportunity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ear infections (otitis media) are highly prevalent in the pediatric population and represent a significant clinical challenge due to the limitations of the gold-standard diagnostic tools, resulting in high antimicrobial prescription and consequent resistance development. Accurate detection and classification of effusion (fluid) in the middle ear is a critical element for this diagnosis, and for making informed medical treatment decisions, particularly regarding antibiotic stewardship. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs through improving patient outcomes by addressing the low diagnostic accuracy and user experience issues of current subjective methods, with a novel, non-invasive imaging tool capable of quantitative depth-resolved measurements to not only visualize the underlying infection behind the eardrum, but also, with automated machine learning image analysis algorithms, minimize user experience dependence and variability.",Clinical Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Approach to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy,10156035,R44DC017422,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Appointment', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Unit', 'Collection', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Elements', 'External auditory canal', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Otitis Media', 'Otitis Media with Effusion', 'Otoscopy', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Resistance development', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tympanic membrane', 'Universities', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'ear infection', 'effusion', 'electronic data capture system', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'image guided', 'improved', 'middle ear', 'middle ear fluid', 'multimodality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDCD,"PHOTONICARE, INC.",R44,2020,1136886,-0.0235187120570106
"Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models Project Summary Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia FTD are devastating neurodegenerative disorders that lie on a genetic and mechanistic continuum. ALS is a disease of motor neurons that that is almost uniformly lethal within only 3-5 years of diagnosis. FTD is a heterogeneous, rapidly progressing syndrome that is among the top three causes of presenile dementia. About 10% of ALS cases are caused by dominantly transmitted gene defects. SOD1 and FUS mutations cause aggressive motor neuron pathology while TDP43 mutations cause ALS-FTD. Further, wild type FUS and TDP43 are components of abnormal inclusions in many FTD cases, suggesting a mechanistic link between these disorders. Early phenotypes are of particular interest because these could lead to targeted interventions aimed at the root cause of the disorder that could stem the currently inexorable disease progression. Elucidating such early, potentially shared characteristics of these disorders should be greatly aided by: 1) knock-in animal models expressing familial ALS-FTD genes; 2) sensitive, rigorous and objective behavioral phenotyping methods to analyze and compare models generated in different laboratories. In published work the co-PIs applied their first-generation, machine vision-based automated phenotyping method, ACBM ‘1.0’ (automated continuous behavioral monitoring) to detect and quantify the earliest-observed phenotypes in Tdp43Q331K knock-in mice. This method entails continuous video recording for 5 days to generate >14 million frames/mouse. These videos are then scored by a trained computer vision system. In addition to its sensitivity, objectivity and reproducibility, a major advantage of this method is the ability to acquire and archive video recordings and to analyze the data at sites, including the Cloud, remote from those of acquisition. We will use Google Cloud TPUs supercomputers that have been designed from the ground up to accelerate cutting-edge machine learning workloads, with a special focus on deep learning. We will analyze this data using Bayesian hierarchical spline models that describe the different mouse behaviors along the circadian rhythm. The current proposal has two main goals: 1) Use deep learning to refine and apply a Next Generation ACBM - ‘2.0’ - that will allow for more sensitive, expansive and robust automated behavioral phenotyping of four novel knock-in models along with the well characterized SOD1G93A transgenic mouse. 2) To establish and validate procedures to enable remote acquisition of video recording data with cloud-based analysis. Our vision is to establish sensitive, robust, objective, and open-source machine vision-based behavioral analysis tools that will be widely available to researchers in the field. Since all the computer-annotated video data is standardized in ACBM 2.0 and will be archived, we envision a searchable ‘behavioral database’, that can be freely mined and analyzed. Such tools are critical to accelerate the development of novel and effective therapeutics for ALS-FTD. Narrative ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are devastating, rapidly progressing diseases and current treatments are of limited value. In this proposal a neuroscientist and a computer scientist have teamed up to develop a new machine vision-based method for behavioral analysis novel mouse models of ALS-FTD. The ultimate goal is to reveal early phenotypes in ALS-FTD models that can be used in understanding disease pathology and in the development of new therapeutic targets.",Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models,9979408,R21NS112743,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Expression Profiling', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Paralysed', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Presenile Dementia', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Paralysis', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cloud based', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'interest', 'knockin animal', 'machine vision', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein TDP-43', 'stem', 'supercomputer', 'superoxide dismutase 1', 'tool']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,446875,-0.043805481862863295
"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,9943875,R01EY031331,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyes', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Neonatal', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Neovascularization', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'macular edema', 'neonate', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'parallel computer', 'portability', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,341800,-0.010885173724617815
"Lupus Nephritis Neural Network, LuNN Up to 60% of adults and 80% of children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop nephritis (LN), with 10–30% progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The gold standard for diagnosis of LN is a renal biopsy. Histological parameters remain the best predictors of ESRD. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of LN has several shortcomings. In multiple inter-observer renal pathology assessment studies reported thus far, the inter- pathologist correlation coefficients, or concordance, in assessing most histological parameters have been sub-optimal. This has provided the impetus for the current proposal. We propose to leverage the power of computer vision and deep learning to build a classifier that rivals the best-trained renal pathologists in making a histological diagnosis of LN using current diagnostic criteria. We propose to train a deep convolutional neural network to distinguish the different LN classes, and to identify a full spectrum of histological attributes useful for diagnosis. We will compare the performance of the newly generated neural network in scoring glomerular/tubulo-interstitial features and LN classes, against a panel of human renal pathologists. Finally, we propose to build a neural network that can predict clinical outcome based on baseline renal pathology. Reliable and reproducible classification of LN could dramatically improve patient management and long-term renal and patient survival. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of lupus nephritis is imprecise, and marked by significant inter-pathologist discordance in readings. We propose to leverage the power of computer vision and deep learning to build a classifier that rivals the best-trained renal pathologists in making a histological diagnosis of lupus nephritis. Reliable and reproducible classification of LN could dramatically improve patient management and long-term renal and patient survival.","Lupus Nephritis Neural Network, LuNN",10246669,R56DK122036,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cellular Structures', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'End stage renal failure', 'Feedback', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Kidney', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mus', 'Nephritis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Retrieval', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'falls', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'kidney biopsy', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predict clinical outcome', 'time interval', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly', 'web portal']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R56,2020,100750,-0.025545803486435245
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program.

We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9852419,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,711592,0.010701362032890084
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,10015315,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,312939,0.0016412426701367814
"Developing a virtual placenta biobank Project Summary / Abstract The placenta is the first organ to develop and functions as the fetal lung, kidney, gut, skin, immune and endocrine systems. It is the cause of, and reflects changes from, most diseases in pregnancy, yet remains understudied. This career development proposal will train me in the tools and practice of digital pathology, while I apply them to the placenta with the hypothesis that there are reproducible, quantitative changes in the placenta that can be modeled and used to identify abnormalities via artificial intelligence (AI). I will create a publicly available atlas of microscopically normal placentas from throughout the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Whole slide imaging will be performed on microscopic slides of placentas from the beginning of the 2nd trimester (13 weeks) through post-term (42 weeks). I will lead a team to annotate tissue type, structures, and cells. Algorithms will be trained to replicate the manual annotations. To study the changes in the placenta over time, automated measurements will be performed to identify changes in shape, size, and cellularity of placental structures that correlate with gestational age. This research can be used to develop a model of placental development and study prematurity. I will demonstrate detection of diseases of pregnancy, using preeclampsia (PreE) as an example. Placentas with microscopic changes classically seen in PreE will be scanned and annotated and algorithms trained and tested to identify them. Like many diseases of pregnancy, placental changes in PreE are variable and sometimes absent. Slides from PreE cases with no microscopic abnormalities will be scanned and examined using the quantitative parameters developed for normal placentas, testing the hypothesis that one or more of them will significantly differ between PreE cases and gestational age- matched controls. I am an Assistant Professor of Pathology at Northwestern University with an emerging focus in informatics and machine learning for diseases of pregnancy. The mentor for this project is Lee D.A. Cooper, PhD, an expert in digital pathology and machine learning. The co-mentor is David M. Aronoff, MD, an expert in maternal-child health. Mentor and co-mentor both have a history of NIH funding and graduating mentees to independence. The advisory committee consists of a digital pathology expert (Gutman), a pediatrician (Mestan) and a pathologist physician scientist (Yang). They have proposed an aggressive schedule of one-on-one meetings, coursework, seminars, and scientific meetings to supplement learning by doing the science. Completion of these studies will build my expertise in the application of machine learning to placental pathology while creating a new, publicly- accessible tool for the rapid assessment and understanding of organ structure and function with great potential to improve maternal-child health. Project Narrative The placenta grows over the course of gestation from a single layer of cells to a complex organ that acts as the fetal skin, lung, gut, kidney, immune system, and endocrine system. This project will develop an online repository of placenta microscopic images over the course of gestation from normal placentas and one disease of pregnancy, preeclampsia. Using artificial intelligence to quantitatively describe the changes over time in normal placentas and those with disease could help understand preterm birth and diseases of pregnancy.",Developing a virtual placenta biobank,10040733,K08EB030120,"['Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Cellularity', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decidual Cell', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elements', 'Endocrine system', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Feeds', 'Fetal Lung', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemosiderosis', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Organ', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Radar', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Shapes', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Spiral Artery of the Endometrium', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Villous', 'Villus', 'Yang', 'algorithm training', 'biobank', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chorionic plate', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'fetal', 'health of the mother', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'meetings', 'microscopic imaging', 'novel', 'online repository', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'professor', 'supplemental instruction', 'tool', 'trophoblast', 'virtual', 'whole slide imaging']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2020,185630,-0.020040961620246406
"The interaction of myosin and the thin filament: how mutations cause allosteric dysfunction and their connection to genetic cardiomyopathy Project Summary: The long-term goal of this research program is to develop a rigorously experimentally validated all-atom computational model of the cardiac thin filament (CTF) bound to myosin S1 which provides a unique and accessible platform to identify novel, high resolution disease mechanisms linked to Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). In the prior funding period, we refined and extended our existing CTF computational model and successfully employed it to identify unique and clinically relevant allosteric disease mechanisms including HCM mutation-induced changes in myofilament Ca2+ kinetics, mutation-specific molecular causes of differential cardiac remodeling and disease progression. This included an in vivo validation via the development of a novel transgenic mouse model of cTnT-linked dilated cardiomyopathy and a predictive algorithm to determine the pathogenicity of cTnT mutations that out-performed existing computational approaches in a preliminary test. The key to these advances has been the ability of the current model to precisely identify and locate allosteric changes caused by mutations throughout all components of the CTF followed by closely coupled experimental validation and eventual in vivo model correlation. We now propose to significantly expand the biological complexity of the model to include myosin S1, the molecular motor that drives contraction and the second most common genetic cause of HCM. This important and challenging advance will facilitate a deeper understanding of disease pathogenesis by, for the first time, incorporating the role of molecular allosteric mechanisms between myosin S1 and thin filament. This new computational – experimental platform will be used for both mechanistic insight (for example used for the identification of novel myofilament disease targets,) and the development of a comprehensive deep-learning predictive algorithm to assign pathogenicity to both myosin and thin filament HCM mutations. The latter represents the first use of high-resolution structure, dynamics and function to predict HCM disease allele pathogenicity, a central challenge in the clinical management of these complex patients. Both the training and testing components of the deep learning development will utilize data from the highly annotated and curated SHaRe HCM registry thus greatly improving translational power. Two Specific Aims will be pursued: Aim 1 will utilize state of the art rare event simulation methods developed in one of our groups and refinement of existing unstructured domains of the CTF via FRET to establish the new model. Aim 2 will employ an extensive program of computational analysis and subsequent in vitro validation using pathogenic, variants of unknown significance and non- pathogenic HCM alleles derived from SHaRe to provide inputs to the machine learning environment for algorithm development. Novel disease mechanisms for myosin and thin filament HCM that include crosstalk between the two components will also be explored. Elucidation of these mechanisms can be the basis for robust molecular approaches to disease. Precision medicine and “molecular” medicine are concepts that aim to employ a patient’s genetic structure to discern the best medical treatments for disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disease that afflicts 1/500 people. This application translates our knowledge of the molecular level effects of cardiac tissue mutation to disease and will aim to lead to eventual treatment.",The interaction of myosin and the thin filament: how mutations cause allosteric dysfunction and their connection to genetic cardiomyopathy,10071638,R01HL107046,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Anisotropy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Breath Tests', 'C-terminal', 'Cardiac', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical Management', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Differential Scanning Calorimetry', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Fluorescence Anisotropy', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced Mutation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfilaments', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Molecular Motors', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sarcomeres', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick Filament', 'Thin Filament', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'educational atmosphere', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inherited cardiomyopathy', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phosphorescence', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'quantum chemistry', 'response', 'simulation', 'stopped-flow fluorescence', 'success', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2020,585711,-0.022923440188577608
"Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer Abstract FreeSurfer is a tool for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that has proven to be a flexible and powerful technology for quantifying the effects of many conditions, including numerous neurological disorders, on human brain anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, chemical composition, physiology and function. In the past 20 years, these open source tools have been developed to accurately and automatically segment an array of brain structures and have become the core analysis infrastructure for the Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI). In this project, we seek the resources to radically increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of these tools, taking advantage of exciting new results in Deep Learning. This will enable us to more accurately quantify neuroanatomical changes that are critical to diagnosing, staging and assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in diseases such as Alzheimer’s. This includes the generation of documentation, tutorials, unit tests, regression tests and system tests to harden the tools and make them usable by clinicians and neuroscientists, and finally the distribution and support of the data, manual labelings and tools to the more than 40,000 researchers that use FreeSurfer through our existing open source mechanism. In addition, we will analyze the entire Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset and return it for public release, including a set of manually labeled data that can be used to optimize Deep Learning tools for Alzheimer’s Disease over the next decade. Relevance Successful completion of the proposed project will increase the usability and accuracy of our publicly available segmentation tools, and open up new possibilities, such as integrating them into the MRI scanner and rapidly detecting Alzheimer’s-related changes. These new capabilities well enable other studies to significantly increase their ability to detect AD and other disease effects in research settings as well as phase II and phase III clinical trials due to the radical increase in speed of the new tools, enabling them to be applied to a diverse set of MRI contrasts and much larger datasets, rapidly and accurately. Further, they will allow rapid application of cutting-edge analyses to the ongoing Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset, improving the ability to extract early biomarkers of this devastating disease.",Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer,9970009,R01AG064027,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'early detection biomarkers', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'skills', 'spatial relationship', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site', 'wiki']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,649026,-0.0852003257796051
"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its risk factors of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent in the United States. To better understand the mechanism between adiposity-obesity-related CKD mechanism, the proposed research will implement machine learning algorithms, and identify distinct patient subgroups and discover novel CKD biomarkers, using the clinical and high-dimensional metabolomics data from a diverse cohort of CKD patients. The findings of our study hold promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD, and facilitate personalized disease management.",Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease,9964494,F31DK122683,"['Active Learning', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome Assessment', 'PTH gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Troponin T', 'Tryptophan', 'United States', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'patient subsets', 'personalized management', 'population based', 'preservation', 'random forest', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted biomarker', 'tool']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,-0.023072632578876585
"Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Through this proposal, I will develop and evaluate a sepsis prediction tool targeted to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Allogeneic HCT recipients are an immunocompromised population that is disproportionately affected by sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated immunologic response to an infection. While it is well established that early detection and treatment of sepsis with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce the risk of mortality, recent data suggests early broad-spectrum antibiotic use in allogeneic HCT recipients may have microbiota-mediated detrimental effects on morbidity and mortality. Because of the risks associated with both missed and falsely identified sepsis events among allogeneic HCT recipients, early and accurate sepsis diagnosis is crucial. However, sepsis is generally challenging to diagnose and is made more complicated in allogeneic HCT recipients by the fact that sepsis presents differently following transplantation and common complications of the transplant procedure present like sepsis. In previous work, we demonstrated that current sepsis clinical criteria have low predictive value among allogeneic HCT recipients and concluded that population specific prediction tools are needed. Recently developed single algorithm, machine learning sepsis prediction tools have shown promising results in general, immuno-competent populations. However, few studies have tested the ability of machine learning workflows to predict sepsis in high-risk, immunocompromised patients, such as allogeneic HCT recipients. Additionally, current sepsis prediction tools rely on the assumption that the true relationship between the predictors and the outcome is contained within a single algorithm. This proposed work has two main objectives. The first is to develop an automated sepsis prediction tool for allogeneic HCT recipients using a state-of-the-art ensemble-based machine learning workflow (the super learner) that relaxes the single algorithm assumption of current sepsis prediction tools. The second is to estimate the utility of this tool in comparison to currently available tools in both traditional (accuracy methods) and novel ways (mathematical modeling of health outcomes). Both aims will be completed with the ultimate goal of improving sepsis prediction among allogeneic HCT recipients and in such, reducing sepsis related mortality and inappropriate antibiotic use among this hard to diagnose population. Further, this research will advance the methodological discussion around the usefulness of machine learning prediction tools in clinical practice and the use of ensemble modeling for prediction of rare, high-case fatality diseases. Such advances have the potential to improve the prediction of health outcomes beyond sepsis and reduce the burden of treatable diseases among immunocompromised populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening dysregulated host response to an infection that disproportionately affects allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Early detection and appropriate antibiotic therapy have been shown to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with sepsis, but clinical criteria currently recommended in sepsis detection have poor predictive value among HCT recipients. This project consists of the development of an automated, population-specific sepsis diagnostic tool and an estimate of the health implications of tool implementation.",Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population,10064529,F31HL154509,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus', 'System', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical practice', 'data cleaning', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'random forest', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2020,45082,-0.005022673730386407
"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10055834,R01CA253475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caucasians', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Department of Defense', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metformin', 'Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Subgroup', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'specific biomarkers', 'working group']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360281,-0.04018755394437592
"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9970413,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,497020,-0.018603946222234536
"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,10018461,F31AI133871,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Anaplasmosis', 'Area', 'Award', 'Babesia microti', 'Babesiosis', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Black-legged Tick', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Characteristics', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological Change', 'Ecology', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Entomology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'New York', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Tick-Borne Infections', 'Ticks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'anthropogenesis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cost effective', 'decision tree learning', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'environmental change', 'geographic population', 'granulocyte', 'human disease', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'regression trees', 'spatial temporal variation', 'statistics', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne pathogen', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,38185,-0.021269956958826587
"Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models Project abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. A critical gap in the treatment of PD patients is that there is no clinically adopted method to predict an individual's progression rate. A predictor would enable the enrichment of disease modifying drug trials with fast progressors likely to show changes in the short duration of a clinical trial and enable a more informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops a composite biomarker of progression rate using the connectivity information provided by resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and deep learning. Deep learning (DL) is well suited to form predictive models because it learns both an optimal hierarchy of features and how to combine them for accurate prediction. In rs-fMRI the blood-oxygen level dependent signal can be analyzed to infer connectivity throughout the brain. Traditionally, connectivity has been computed as the correlation between average regional activation time courses. However correlation based connectivity is prone to inferring spurious connections due to its inability to distinguish indirect from direct connectivity and inability to distinguish bidirectional from unidirectional connectivity. A causal connectivity approach can discern these differences and thereby provide a more faithful characterization of the true neurobiological connectivity. The existing literature suggests connectivity, particularly causal connectivity, from rs-fMRI can inform the estimation of PD progression, but the attempt to predict progression rate with causal connectivity in a DL model is unique to this project.  This research develops several distinct approaches for building a progression rate predictor and apply them to three datasets including: the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) dataset, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's prospective imaging extension to the NINDS PBDP. In these studies, individual progression rates have been tracked over multiple years using multiple clinical measures. First, causal and correlative measures will be generated regionally and used with a DL model to create a baseline predictor of progression rate. Second, voxel- level causal measures will be generated as the increased granularity is expected to improve prediction accuracy. Third, since purely data-driven DL methods can be sensitive to dataset limitations, such as insufficient subjects and noise, these limitations will be addressed by developing a new structural connectivity regularization approach that constrains causal connectivity by the subject's own diffusion MRI. This regularization method will be general and likely applicable for building predictors for other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. This proposal will yield both DL models for predicting progression rate and a novel method to calculate constrained causal connectivity. All predictive models, composite neuroimaging biomarkers of progression rate and software will be publicly disseminated for ready incorporation by the scientific and clinical communities. Project narrative Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and this debilitating and incurable disease has no known cure. A cure for PD remains elusive due to the lack of clinically adopted predictors of progression rate, which if constructed would 1) hasten the discovery of disease modifying drugs by enriching clinical trials with fast progressors who likely will show changes over the trial, 2) allow for stratification of patients by progression rate in those trials, and 3) enable an informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops and validates distinct approaches to predict PD progression rate, identifies new biomarkers of progression rate, and yields a generalizable framework for constraining causal measures from fMRI with the subject's own structural connectivity that is readily repurposable for other neurological disorders with connectivity changes such as stroke and Alzheimer's.",Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models,10019347,F31NS115348,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Florida', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'tractography']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2020,34768,-0.07541229686196387
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9923450,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,334508,0.008294227571945104
"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies. Public Health Statement Vascular health is an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases We propose to develop a method that can produce quantifiable images of multiple blood flow related parameters with a single scan and without the use of contrast injections. We will use this method to gain a better understanding of the relationship between Parkinson’s disease and cerebral blood flow, and expect that our method will have multiple applications beside Parkinson’s disease.",Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease,9968566,R01NS112233,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arteries', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fatigue', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human Volunteers', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Noise', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spin Labels', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aging brain', 'deep learning', 'feeding', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'perfusion imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vascular factor', 'vector', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,348762,-0.018482285138630646
"Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Early diagnosis and close monitoring of glaucoma are important because the onset is insidious and the damage is irreversible. Advanced imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) have been used in the past 2 decades to improve the objective evaluation of glaucoma. OCT has higher axial spatial resolution than other posterior eye imaging modalities and can precisely measure neural structures. However, structural imaging alone has limited sensitivity for detecting early glaucoma and only moderate correlation with visual field (VF) loss. Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed novel OCT angiography technologies to image vascular plexuses that supply the retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cells damaged by glaucoma. Our results showed that OCT angiographic parameters have better correlation with VF parameters. We have also found that measurement of focal and sectoral glaucoma damage using high-definition volumetric OCT angiographic and structural parameters improves diagnostic performance. The goal of the proposed project is to further improve the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma using ultrahigh-speed OCT and artificial intelligence machine learning techniques. The specific aims are: 1. Develop quantitative wide-field OCT angiography. We will develop a swept-source OCT prototype that  is 4 times faster than current commercial OCT systems. The higher speed will be used to fully sample the  neural structures and associated capillary plexuses damaged by glaucoma. 2. Simulate VF by combining structural and angiographic OCT. Preliminary results showed that both  structural and angiographic OCT parameters have high correlation with VF on a sector basis. It may be  possible to accurately simulate VF results by combining these parameters using an artificial neural  network. The simulated VF may be more precise and reliable than subjective VF testing. 3. Longitudinal clinical study in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. Our novel OCT structural and  angiographic parameters have high accuracy in diagnosing glaucoma. Neural network analysis of structural  and angiographic data from a larger clinical study could further improve diagnostic accuracy. Longitudinal  follow-up will assess if simulated VF could monitor disease progression as well as actual VF. 4. Clinical study to assess the effects of glaucoma treatments. Preliminary results suggest that OCT  angiography could detect the improvement in capillary density after glaucoma surgery and the effects of  drugs. These intriguing effects will be tested in before-and-after comparison studies. If successful, we will have an OCT diagnostic system that in minutes provides objective information on the location and severity of glaucoma damage. This approach could replace time-consuming and unreliable VF testing. Measuring the improvement in retinal circulation could be a quicker way to detect the benefit of glaucoma therapies that work through neuroprotection or regeneration, compared to monitoring VF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical coherence tomography is a high-resolution imaging technology that can non-invasively measure both the eye structures and small blood vessels that are damaged by glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The proposed research will further improve this technology so that it can provide detailed measurement over wider areas inside the eye, detect earlier stages of glaucoma, evaluate the location and severity of glaucoma damage, monitor disease progression, and provide more timely assessment of the effectiveness of therapy. A goal of this project is to determine if this objective imaging technology can provide information that is equivalent to or better than subjective visual field testing, which though time-consuming and poorly reliable, is the current gold standard for long-term monitoring and management of glaucoma.",Functional and Structural Optical Coherence Tomography for Glaucoma,9952373,R01EY023285,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eyedrops', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal macula', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trabeculectomy', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'cell injury', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'fiber cell', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'ganglion cell', 'glaucoma surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'neural network', 'neuroprotection', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'retina circulation', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'vascular factor', 'visual performance']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,564228,-0.010306356613320033
"THE SEARCH FOR COVID-19 PREVENTION AND CURE: ADDRESSING THE CRITICAL ROLE OF INNATE/ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY BY INTEGRATING NOVEL INFORMATICS, TRANSLATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES, AND ONGOING CLINICAL TRIAL RESEARCH Individual CTSA hubs are leading the national clinical and translational research efforts in developing new approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This crucial role was natural. Long before the current crisis, CTSA hubs were committed to translation, building multidisciplinary teams of investigators and community partners, overcoming regulatory burdens, ensuring quality in clinical and human research, developing transformative informatics, and disruptive technologies for diagnostics and therapeutics. In this proposal, we build on our center’s active participation in meaningful clinical trials (e.g., the NIH Remdesivir RCT), the early creation of a biospecimen repository from COVID-19 patients, institutional commitment and fundraising that led to a $3.5 million pilot fund distribution, a robust and accessible clinical database repository, and the ongoing work of an NCATS-supported CTSA Collaboration Innovation Award (a coalition of the J. Craig Venter Institute, UCSD, UCI, and Stanford) focused on artificial intelligence approaches for the analysis of flow cytometry data. Using the emerging informatics framework of supervised generalized canonical correlation for integrative data analysis, we will link clinical data from COVID-19 patients enrolled in a variety of trials and at various stages of disease with innovative in vitro evaluation of innate and adaptive immunity, an area still poorly understood in SARS-CoV-2 pathology, obtained from patient biospecimens to obtain mechanistic insights of COVID-19 pathogenesis at a systems level. Innate and adaptive immunity are particularly relevant to COVID-19 disease pathogenesis because they play key, but distinct, roles at all phases of the illness (initial tissue-virus interaction; systemic responses; the cell-mediated cytokine storm leading to multi- organ failure and death, likely long after levels of viremia have fallen; and, ultimately, protective immunity). The current CCIA novel flow cytometry informatics research permits elucidation of dynamic cellular immune responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic that were heretofore unobservable. Using Hi-DAFi for mass cytometry analysis, validated informatics pipelines for single cell transcriptomics analysis, and cutting-edge statistical data integration and machine learning strategies tied back to the available clinical data we will be able to discover novel associations between cellular biomarkers and disease state, a particular therapy, and disease mediating factors such as age, health disparities, and the presence of other diseases or conditions like obesity. This information will aid in critical efforts to target new therapies and possibly identify idiosyncratic individual physiologic variables that render certain patients who seem to have no known comorbidities more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease. Finally, the robust connection between the UCI hub and both regional and national networks (e.g., BRAID, the coalition of the 5 UC CTSAs, and NCATS Trial Innovation Network) will provide an unprecedented opportunity to rapidly disseminate clinically relevant discoveries and engage the talent and insight of the many clinicians and scientists working tirelessly to end this pandemic.

"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"Prognostic Markers of Emphysema Progression Project Summary/Abstract Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects up to 24 million people in the United States and is projected to be the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 with a total cost of $50 billion. COPD has been traditionally dichotomized into the clinical phenotypes of emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In particular, emphysema is defined as abnormal, permanent dilation of the distal airspaces. The development and progression of this pathologic process are associated with a decline in lung function and progressive clinical impairment. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the chest is increasingly being leveraged to quantify the disease and its progression objectively. Current approaches to quantify emphysema progression are limited and discard most of the spatial and temporal information in CT scans obtained at inspiration and expiration. In this proposal, we plan on developing computational components to prognosticate emphysema progression that builds upon image density markers and lung mechanical strain characteristics conditioned on their underlying emphysema subtypes. This proposal leverages our previous experience in computational emphysema subtyping to discover, validate and translate a novel panel of prognostic markers tailored around the postulated mechanisms of emphysema progression: inflammation injury and mechanical strain. To reach this goals, we will (1) develop an advanced emphysema subtyping approach using novel deep learning architectures, (2) develop a fast mass preserving large displacement registration approach to enable the discovery of local elastic properties of lung tissue between inspiratory and expiration CT scans, (3) discover new subtype-specific biomarker features based on image density relations and mechanical properties using unsupervised deep learning techniques within a common statistical framework, and (4) validate the prognostic value of the proposed biomarkers and their association with decline end-points and clinical outcomes to enable its clinical interpretation and translation. In addition to that, will be explored alternative prognostic models based on advanced machine learning techniques and performed a model comparison study to define the most prognostic model for emphysema progression. Our analysis will process 12,300 scans corresponding to 5,517 subjects with baseline and follow-up data from the COPDGene cohort –one of the largest cohort in COPD containing CT images at inspiration and expiration, respiratory and genetic measurements. The proposed methodology will provide reproducible, automatic and low-cost prognostic in-vivo biomarkers of emphysema progression that may enable the discovery of new therapies and translate them into clinical practice. Project Narrative Computed tomographic assessments of emphysema progression based on emphysema subtyping and lung mechanical strain biomarkers in the COPDGene study may provide insight into its prognostication.

"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,10019553,R01EY013178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Pathology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Width', 'advanced disease', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'density', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'invention', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'macula', 'mathematical methods', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'ocular imaging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,687519,-0.009147580840815706
"Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and lack of effective therapies for multi-drug resistant organisms, the development of new tools or models which risk-stratify patients for colonization and infection by AR bacteria is of paramount importance, particularly in high-risk populations. The significance of the gut microbiome in mediating colonization resistance against drug resistant pathogens as well as the role of microbiota-depleting antibiotics in the development of AR infections is being increasingly appreciated. However, there is currently a deficiency of methods integrating microbiome and antibiotic factors into AR- predictive algorithms. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the factors driving the epidemiology of AR-colonization and infection by incorporating metagenomic and antibiotic administration data of a well-defined clinical cohort. In this proposal, we focus on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (from whom we have already collected extensive longitudinal stool samples and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing) because of the high rates of AR pathogen colonization and severe risk for infection. The overarching hypothesis that will be tested is that the baseline presence of a limited number of key bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical for the risk of colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen when combined with the administration of specific antimicrobials. We will begin our research by comprehensively determining the epidemiology of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection in our cohort via culture based stool sample analyses and clinical chart review, respectively. Using shotgun metagenomics, we will establish whether the baseline intestinal microbiome species and resistome characteristics are associated with the acquisition of AR pathogens colonizing or causing infection. Similarly, we will ascertain the relationship between antimicrobial exposure, microbiome disruption, and subsequent AR emergence. The data from these studies will be integrated into Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models to improve the prediction of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection outcomes. The proposed career development award, which utilizes the expertise of a superlative mentorship team and a uniquely designed research and training plan, will enable me the opportunity to build upon my current expertise in microbiology, genomics, and molecular epidemiology by adding advanced training in shotgun metagenomic analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistical modeling. Moreover, the numerous resources and support provided by my institution and mentoring team will ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator as well as establish a strong foundation for my long-term goals of understanding and mitigating the impact of antimicrobial resistance in human health via integration of multiple –omics platforms and provision of personalized genomic-based medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant (AR) infections are one of the most serious public health threats and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The proposed research will use a combination of culture-based techniques and high-throughput approaches to determine the epidemiology of colonization and infectious events by AR-pathogens, characterize the gut microbiome, and mine clinical data of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy in order to identify microbial species, antibiotic resistance genes, patient features, and antibiotic administration factors that affect the risk for colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit metagenomics as an epidemiological tool for understanding susceptibility to AR outcomes and to build predictive risk models which can be potentially incorporated into prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate AR infection events in high-risk patients.",Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics,9851830,K01AI143881,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal microbes', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'effective therapy', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'leukemia', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multiple omics', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'resistance gene', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2020,110387,0.0085422349937455
"Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients 37,000 patients a year receive an external ventricular drain (EVD) in the setting of acute hydrocephalus in the US, generating in-hospital charges of $151,672 per patient, or $5.6 billion dollars a year. There is great motivation in the neurointensive care unit for the optimization of EVD management to reduce infection rates, accurately determine need for permanent shunting, and to do so efficiently in order to minimize duration of drainage and length of stay (LOS). Risk factors for ventriculitis include EVD duration, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling frequency, presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and insertion technique. Severe CSF disturbances in patients with IVH and EVDs limit the value of routine CSF analysis for ventriculitis prediction. And ventriculitis diagnosis is imprecise, with only a minority declaring culture positivity while all still demanding antibiotic treatment and delay of permanent shunt. This leads to unnecessary empiric antibiotic treatment and increased LOS (30.8 vs 22.6 days), with the associated cost ($30,335 more) and morbidity (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection, emergence of drug-resistant pathology). The process of determining permanent shunt dependence is variable between institutions, particularly around the decision of when to begin weaning the EVD or predicting delayed resolution. These decisions in the subacute period determine LOS and associated adverse events, exposure to radiography, and commitment to potentially unnecessary permanent foreign materials in the CNS, which then carry lifelong risks for infection and blockage. There is no accurate noninvasive test (that does not further introduce infection) to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. In previous work, we were able to predict with good accuracy who would need permanent shunt placement using ICP waveform analysis collected during a 24 hour clamp trial. However, a complex model can only be justified if it achieves a diagnosis earlier or more accurately than traditional clinical methods. In preliminary work, we clustered raw ICP waveforms and found a pattern of waveforms specific for ventriculitis that appears 1 day before diagnostic cultures are sent. Our central hypothesis is that there is a temporal quantitative signal in ICP waveform reflective of intracranial dynamics that can be harvested to optimize acute hydrocephalus management. Impact and Significance: Noninvasive quantitative models based on ICP waveform analysis that diagnose ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt would decrease the duration of EVD and the frequency of CSF sampling, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing LOS, associated adverse events of ICU stay, and empiric antibiotics. There is no accurate noninvasive test to diagnose ventriculitis nor is there a timely method to predict need for permanent shunt after acute hydrocephalus. To fill this gap, we propose developing a quantitative model from intracranial pressure waveform analysis to increase precision in the diagnosis of ventriculitis and accurately predict need for permanent shunt. Accurate noninvasive sequential machine learning models could decrease external ventricular drain duration and cerebrospinal fluid sampling frequency, two of the risk factors for ventriculitis, while also decreasing length of stay and empiric systemic antibiotics.",Machine Learning to Optimize Management of Acute Hydrocephalus Patients,10057040,R21NS113055,"['Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Caring', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Drainage procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Harvest', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Charges', 'Hour', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'intraventricular hemorrhage', 'long short term memory', 'recurrent neural network', 'vector']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,445500,-0.011529279333978711
"Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH) is a leading cause of neonate mortality in the developing world, but there are limited resources in place for appropriately diagnosing and monitoring the infections that lead to hydrocephalus. There is often a lack of personnel and laboratory resources available for the gathering and processing of lumbar puncture and blood cultures, which are the gold-standard for diagnosing the infectious agents at play in sepsis and PIH. In order to overcome this obstacle, CSF and blood samples were taken from a cohort of septic neonates in Mbale, Uganda, as well as a cohort of neonates and infants who had already progressed to PIH. Cranial ultrasounds (CrUS) were taken from the cohort of septic neonates, and head CT scans were gathered from the PIH cohort. This proposal hypothesizes that the pathogens determined from RNA and DNA sequencing of the blood and CSF samples can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to recognize imaging phenotypes characteristic of the underlying pathogen. Therefore, PIH can be prevented by providing pathogen-specific diagnosis and targeted treatment recommendations at the bedside for septic neonates using CrUS. Furthermore, surgical treatment success for PIH can be optimized using CT for the purpose of identifying the underlying pathogen and providing management plan recommendations. This project provides an ideal training environment for a fellow interested in pediatric neurosurgery with a research emphasis on engineering and machine learning applied to image analysis. The interdisciplinary and global nature of the project encourages development of a collaborative and innovative research approach. The home institution of Penn State provides multiple clinical opportunities for growth in pediatric neurosurgery, the MD/PhD program is supportive of truly translational research efforts, and the sponsor and co-sponsor are more than adequately prepared to provide all aspects of training mentorship necessary to accomplish the aims of this project and develop a well-rounded physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-infectious hydrocephalus is a devastating condition with a global impact, but diagnostic options and available treatment plans are limited in the developing world in particular.

"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10013198,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'respiratory morbidity', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2020,187049,-0.005792766659945285
"A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is a serious condition induced by an infection, often by a bacterial pathogen, leading to organ damage or even death. Despite numerous advances in medicine over the years, the condition still affects millions of people in both developed and developing countries. In the US, sepsis affects 1.7M and kills over 265,000 people annually. Sepsis mortality rates in developing countries are substantially higher. In terms of demographics, sepsis affects humans of all age and race, but it is most pronounced at the age extremes (infants and the elderly) and patients whose immune system is already under strain due to other illnesses or immune system-weakening therapies, e.g., cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Blood cultures are currently the default technique used in detecting and diagnosing the root cause of sepsis. However, blood-cultures can take upwards of 24-48 hours in order to obtain results. In that time, the patient can experience irreversible harm due to the condition if not treated properly. Unfortunately, precise and effective antibiotic treatment requires knowledge of the pathogen causing sepsis. Beyond a long time to get an answer, blood cultures often exhibit alarmingly high false negatives (failure to detect a pathogen causing sepsis) and typically do not precisely identify the pathogen causing sepsis.  Hence there have been several efforts aimed at detecting and identifying the broad range of potential pathogens causing sepsis and circumventing the need for blood cultures. However, many of the recently proposed methods for detecting and diagnosing sepsis exhibit one or more of the following drawbacks: (i) they lack high sensitivity (ability to detect a pathogen); (ii) they cannot accurately identify a broad range of pathogens from a single sam- ple; (iii) take a (relatively) long time; (iv) require a large volume of blood; or (v) cannot be used in the real-time monitoring of sepsis (either detecting pathogens known to cause sepsis or quantifying the patient's response to antimicrobial treatment).  We are proposing a new sepsis detection method, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy (a high-throughput technique for imaging millions of microscopic particles) and deep learning based image analysis (techniques leveraged in facial recognition and self-driving cars) to overcome the above mentioned limitations. The approach has proven capable of detecting a variety of bacterial species in low concentrations of mouse blood in less than 1 hour of processing time with as little as 50 L of blood. In this proposal, one of our aims is to optimize our approach and quantify the accuracy and limits of detection in human blood. Our patent pending approach has also been licensed to a major manufacturer of ﬂow imaging microscopes. Another aim of this research is to begin integration of our technology with an existing commercial instrument with the intention of providing a compact self- contained device that can be deployed at numerous hospitals world-wide. The implementation of our platform should have a major impact on antimicrobial treatment in all areas of the hospital. Project Narrative  Sepsis affects 1.7M US citizens (causing roughly 270k deaths) each year; the condition is also the most expensive condition treated in US hospitals costing approximately 24B USD each year. Current methods for detecting and determining the source of the infection causing sepsis are inaccurate, too slow, and do not provide detailed pathogen speciﬁc information needed for effective treatment. Our proposal aims at developing a fast approach, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy and deep learning, for detecting and determining the root cause of sepsis from blood samples (addressing many issues facing sepsis detection and diagnosis) which can deployed at a variety of hospitals worldwide.",A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning,10078833,R43EB029863,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bedside Testings', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification Scheme', 'Colony-forming units', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Length of Stay', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Preparation', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'age group', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'human DNA', 'human old age (65+)', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infant death', 'instrument', 'intrapartum', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'nano', 'nanoproducts', 'neonatal sepsis', 'older patient', 'optic flow', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient response', 'point of care', 'preterm newborn', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'real time monitoring', 'side effect', 'tool']",NIBIB,"URSA ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,112402,-0.01512559577561866
"Automatic analysis of 3D skin images for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) severity assessment Project Summary More than 20,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (including bone marrow transplants) are performed in the U.S. each year to cure a range of diseases ranging from leukemias to sickle cell anemia to autoimmune deficiencies in children. Unfortunately, most long-term non-relapse survivors will die of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which remains a disease of steadily increasing incidence and profound unmet need. A fundamental barrier in cGVHD management and research is a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and reproducible measures of disease severity and progression. Skin is the most commonly affected organ in cGVHD and automated techniques capable of measuring precisely the surface area of involved skin in photographs may provide the tools necessary for effectively evaluating patient progress. We propose to (1) create the data set necessary to develop machine learning-based methods for the automatic analysis of cGVHD images, and (2) implement and evaluate these methods. Project Narrative  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a lethal disease that affects most long-term hematopoietic stem cell transplant (including bone marrow transplants) recipients. Skin images are used to assess disease severity and progression but the technology required to quantitatively and reproducibly analyze these images is lacking.

"Sensory Cue Integration in Melanoma Screening Imaging biomarkers are features in images that have biological implications. For example, in a picture of a person with red hair, the red hair is a feature and the implication is that there is a mutation in the MC1R gene that provides instructions for making a protein called the melanocortin 1 receptor. This feature, an imaging biomarker, can be used as a medical cue to indicate increased risk for melanoma. When used in this context, this imaging biomarker becomes an imaging biomarker cue (IBC), in the sense that it may cue the medical professional observer to alter treatment accordingly, such as recommending sunscreen use. IBCs do not individually bear the full weight of medical decision-making and instead are integrated. IBC analysis may be a process of sensory cue integration or may be a process of observation and integration by technology such as a digital camera and computer. An advantage of the latter is that computational scalability enables machine vision to compute vast permutations of IBCs that would be overwhelming to a human observer. Thus computers can try many potential diagnostic methods rapidly before picking the best one to teach back to humans. The purpose of this project is to develop a human/machine interface for bi-directional teaching so expert dermatologists can teach computers what IBCs they use to achieve accurate diagnosis and computers can teach dermatologists the best way to use current IBCs and suggest integration of new IBCs that machine learning guides them to. As an outcome, we will measure the diagnostic performance of dermatologists who undergo IBC training in detecting melanoma. It is known that early detection saves lives, but the potential of technology to improve early detection, a great need since 10,000 Americans still die each year from melanoma, is unknown. This project will help answer that unknown and if we are successful in translating IBCs with commuter vision and machine learning, more melanomas will be detected early and lives will be saved. Our long-term goal is to reduce melanoma related deaths and unnecessary biopsies by helping clinicians increase the predictive value of dermoscopy-based melanoma screening. We believe sensitivity and specificity of dermoscopy- based melanoma screening for non-expert screeners can be improved by assistive technology, which is highly desirable given the cost of false positives (patient stress and unnecessary biopsies) and the extremely high cost of false negatives (delayed melanoma treatment). This project creates a technology to help medical personnel see and integrate features of abnormal skin spots that help them determine if the spot they are looking at is a melanoma. Since melanoma is deadly if left untreated, this technology helps them guide biopsy and surgical removal of skin to potentially cut more melanomas out (saving lives) and not cut so many benign lesions out unnecessarily (leaving less scars). Our augmentation of vision and cognition uses machine learning in a way that is visually intuitive so physicians may be able to show their patients the rationale behind the choice to surgically excise abnormal skin spots or not to.",Sensory Cue Integration in Melanoma Screening,10025420,R21CA240254,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area Under Curve', 'Back', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cessation of life', 'Cicatrix', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complement Factor D', 'Computers', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health Personnel', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Melanocortin 1 Receptor', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mole the mammal', 'Mutation', 'Nevus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Screening Result', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Skin', 'Skin Abnormalities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Ursidae Family', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'graphical user interface', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'melanoma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'screening', 'success', 'vector']",NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,412585,-0.03675529991929659
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",9995686,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,178842,-0.06921956889940772
"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users. Public Health Relevance: Since the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users).

"Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent, contributes to substantial morbidity in the population, and lacks effective interventions to prevent onset and progression. Importantly, and like many other chronic conditions, OA is not a single disease but rather a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It is becoming increasingly clear that consideration of specific OA phenotypes in clinical studies and trials is critically needed to move the field forward. The overall goal of this line of work is to identify and understand potential phenotypes of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) to better inform future research efforts and treatments; this exploratory R21 project using OA Initiative (OAI) data will investigate novel methodology to support phenotyping in KOA. Successful treatments for OA will need to be targeted to, and tested in, specifically chosen OA phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that an understanding of KOA phenotypes, a key step toward Precision Medicine in OA, will lead to more successful clinical studies in the long-term. To approach this important clinical problem, we propose a project in which we will apply innovative machine learning methods and validation strategies to data from the large, publicly available OAI cohort. We will leverage this large dataset, along with local expertise in statistics, biostatistics and machine learning methodology, to tackle the problem of phenotyping this heterogeneous disease. In Aim 1, we will utilize a data-driven, unsupervised learning approach, to cluster features that best define and discriminate among phenotypes of KOA in the OAI dataset, using biclustering and a novel significance test (SigClust) developed by co-I Marron. For Aim 2, we will test specific hypotheses of relevance to OA outcomes, such as differences between those with and without OA, or those who do or do not develop new or worsening disease, using another set of machine learning methods (Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]), also developed by co-I Marron, in the full cohort and in any identified clusters from Aim 1. In order to address these aims, this proposal involves interdisciplinary collaborations among experts in statistics, biostatistics, computer science, rheumatology, and epidemiology. This work will significantly impact the field by fulfilling a critical need to accurately define OA phenotypes, discover the key features associated with these phenotypes, link phenotype subgroups to underlying mechanisms and use this information to inform and focus future clinical studies. In the long term, we expect that this strategy will lead to more personalized and successful management of the millions of people affected by OA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem, and like many other chronic conditions it is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. The lack of appreciation of this heterogeneity has contributed to the failure of all attempts to date to develop disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs; future trials will need to target specific OA phenotypes. There is a critical need to define and understand phenotypes in OA and link these to outcomes, leading to more personalized and successful management of this common and debilitating disease.",Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping,9889390,R21AR074685,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Arthritis', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee Injuries', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non obese', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk Factors', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug development', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'joint destruction', 'large datasets', 'loss of function', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,200007,-0.0018716756283245178
"DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation Contact PD/PI: Fereidouni, Farzad Abstract Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to- end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis(excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for evaluation, typically through the use of histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process. We propose to optimize, deploy and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components, and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites. The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive and practical approach for the rapid and accurate evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes. Page 6 Project Summary/Abstract Project Narrative Evaluation of fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chemically stained kidney biopsies are essential for diagnosis and disease-severity assessment, but current techniques are time-consuming, somewhat non-specific and contribute to interobserver variability and imprecision, affecting care. We propose to optimize and test a new kind of microscope (“DUET”) that can visualize fibrosis (scarring) and other tissue abnormalities directly from standard slides to enable high-quality reproducible fibrosis scoring and evaluation. This multi-site project will also provide a unique opportunity to perform a retrospective study from hundreds of existing H&E slides with associated months to years of clinical follow-up data, and to create a method with demonstrated utility in more than one institution.",DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation,10261643,R56DK124873,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Basement membrane', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Buffaloes', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrillar Collagen', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Natural History', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirius Red F3B', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Tubular formation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'histological stains', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney fibrosis', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'software development', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,91725,-0.007134224370092341
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease, with a clinically relevant context of use.",Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH),10055845,R01NS114552,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anticoagulants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cavernous Hemangioma', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'IL6 gene', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Immunity', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Vitamin D Deficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'data harmonization', 'disorder subtype', 'follow-up', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbiome', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurovascular unit', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'recruit', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'synergism', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,689695,0.004094266841016609
"Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM PROJECT ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disorder that afflicts nearly 30 million Americans. Current disease staging and therapy is based primarily on spirometry and clinical characteristics. Due to limitations in the standard phenotyping approaches, patients with similarly staged COPD may exhibit strikingly different progression patterns. Small airways disease (SAD), a treatable but occult component of COPD, is a significant contributor to airflow obstruction manifesting early in COPD. In recent years, SAD has been has been implicated as a precursor to the irreversible destruction of lung parenchyma, i.e. emphysema. The ability to predict if and when SAD will lead to emphysema would have an immediate clinical impact on the care of COPD patients. In 2012 we reported on the Parametric Response Map (PRM) analytical technique that when applied to paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans is capable of simultaneously visualizing and quantifying the extent of “functional” SAD (fSAD) and emphysema in a single COPD patient. Since then we have made three key advances: first, PRM-derived fSAD is predictive of spirometric decline in COPD patients and emphysema development; second, we have validated in human lung samples that PRM- derived fSAD is a measure of small airway narrowing and loss; and finally, applying techniques to capture regional variation of fSAD within the lung, we have enhanced PRM (topological PRM [tPRM]) to provide a more sensitive measure of local disease severity than what is possible with the original PRM concept. Based on our findings, we postulate that PRM, or its advanced form tPRM, has the potential to predict long-term patient progression. The goal of this proposal will be to use baseline, Year 5 and recently available Year 10 COPDGene data to determine the ability of PRM to predict disease progression through three Specific Aims: 1) Characterize PRM-derived fSAD progression patterns over a 5 and 10 year period; 2) Determine how regional differences in disease distribution, as determined by tPRM, identify regional onset of local emphysema; and 3) Apply machine learning strategies to PRM/tPRM and other clinical metrics to develop models that predict patient disease trajectories. It is our expectation that PRM metrics will identify COPD patients at risk for more rapid disease progression but that utilizing regional information and machine learning strategies will further enhance our approach. The results of such analyses could both identify patients appropriate for more intense, targeted therapy at an early disease stage and contribute to our understanding of the progression of small airways disease and emphysema in COPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  COPD is a highly prevalent but heterogeneous disorder with rising morbidity and mortality with efforts to develop effective treatments have been hampered by an inability to predict disease progression. This study proposes to apply statistical and deep learning strategies to evaluate novel CT-based analytic techniques as predictors of disease course in a COPD patient cohort. The successful outcome of this study will aid physicians in identifying patients for targeted therapies.",Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM,9865565,R01HL150023,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Chronic Care', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cohort', 'concept mapping', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'regional difference', 'response', 'small airways disease', 'statistical learning', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,700225,-0.014024718900860886
"Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension. Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. The primary modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension (HTN), which is exacerbated by high sodium intake. One third of Americans are hypertensive, of which half exhibit salt-sensitive HTN. Additionally, 12% of HTN patients do not respond to treatment using standard medications. Taken together, these statistics highlight the critical need to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of HTN for the design of alternative treatment options. The gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases including HTN. This project is designed to identify HTN- exacerbating or protective bacteria and their associated metabolic genes to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics for the treatment of HTN. Our preliminary results demonstrate that severe HTN induced by salt consumption correlates with shifts in the gut microbial community of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Therefore, we tested the potential for the gut microbiota to affect HTN by performing a fecal material transfer (FMT) from hypertensive Dahl SS into HTN-resistant rats. We demonstrated that the microbiome was sufficient to exacerbate HTN in recipients and corresponded with statistically significant shifts in the gut microbiome. These results lead us to hypothesize that the gut microbiota directly influences HTN. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of bacterial supplementation during onset of HTN in the Dahl SS rat model. Predetermined strains identified from our preliminary experiments will be grown in vitro and transferred into SS Dahl rats and the effect on blood pressure and kidney damage will be evaluated. Potential mechanisms through which the bacteria influence the severity of HTN will be explored by measuring metabolite production, evaluating gut barrier function, and identifying shifts in the gut microbiome. Aim 2 will utilize machine learning to identify specific gut bacteria and metabolic genes that serve as signatures for the severity of HTN. Experiments in this aim will exploit shotgun metagenomic sequencing and computational approaches to identify specific bacteria and metabolic genes associated with HTN. Their use as predictive biomarkers for HTN will be validated by PCR-based analysis. This work will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology (M&I) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the proposed aims. The Department of M&I offers a state-of-the-art educational program and various opportunities to explore alternative career pathways. We have designed a complementary training plan for my scientific and professional growth that will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. In all, this project is critical for my advancement as a Latina woman in biomedical research, the field of HTN research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for CVD. Project Narrative Hypertension (HTN) is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death world-wide. While the gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases, a mechanism by which the microbiota influence HTN remain unknown. This project is designed to identify specific bacteria, metabolic genes, and potential mechanisms by which the microbiota influence HTN.

"Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed 40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective, cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.  To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple, robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth- arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.  This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fungal infections are common, increasing in frequency and severity, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of invasive fungal infection, and prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy, are key to improving patient outcomes. This proposal aims to adapt a novel paradigm for rapid pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing through the quantitative detection of RNA signatures to transform fungal diagnostics.","Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection",10034036,R01AI153405,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Aspergillus', 'Azoles', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial RNA', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Candida', 'Candida auris', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Class Zygomycetes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mycoses', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Polyenes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computational pipelines', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'effective therapy', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'fungus', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'prophylactic', 'random forest', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2020,645818,-0.01147697165076265
"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,9979523,R03AI146437,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acrylates', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Antibiotics', 'Applications Grants', 'Bacteria', 'Cells', 'Chlamydia', 'Chlamydia Infections', 'Chlamydia genome', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye Infections', 'Gel', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lead', 'Light Microscope', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'PF4 Gene', 'Penicillins', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sodium', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chlamydia vaccine', 'human pathogen', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,77243,-0.026742723124079125
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States.

"Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Calf Muscle Perfusion To Assess Patients With Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with impaired leg function, possible limb loss and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Intermittent claudication (IC) is a classic PAD symptom occurring in 40% of symptomatic patients, and is associated with 5-, and 15-year mortality rates of 30% and 70%, respectively. PAD is a debilitating illness affecting more than 8.5 million Americans of age 40 and older and 202 million people globally. Despite the high prevalence, PAD patients are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than patients with coronary artery disease. Advances in endovascular therapy have reduced risks associated with intervention, enabling revascularization as a routine procedure in patients with lower extremity ischemia. However, revascularization success rates vary substantially and numerous PAD patients do not improve at 1-year despite technically good revascularization. Previous findings suggest that alterations in the microcirculation due to a paucity of collateralization may contribute to functional impairment in PAD patients. We hypothesize that the change in microvascular perfusion can identify PAD patients who do not improve at 12-months after revascularization. We will utilize contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) to assess skeletal muscle perfusion in PAD patients. The CE-MRI measures will be associated with hemodynamics and symptoms. The early identification of individuals with a likely poor prognosis post intervention could help to improve surgical treatment strategies. We will investigate the association of microvascular perfusion (Aim 1) and measures of arterial hemodynamics (Aim 2) with leg function and PAD symptoms. We will utilize machine learning methodologies to identify predictors of poor leg function and symptoms (Aim 3). Given the high incidence of PAD and the associated high risk of cardiovascular events, it is paramount to identify individuals who are less likely to improve following lower extremity revascularization. The data of this clinical imaging study will provide novel information on the etiology of microvascular blood flow in PAD.

"Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future  infection Project Summary / Abstract Background: Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. This goal will be achieved in many countries, but some regions in Ethiopia maintain persistently high levels of infection despite >10 years of intensive control activities. A small proportion of the population likely harbors the majority of trachoma infections, with foci of infection (“hotspots”) at or below the village scale; the operational challenge is accurately predicting where they are with existing data. Advances in machine learning and spatial data science have demonstrated marked improvements in the spatial resolution of predictions for diseases like malaria. Among available biomarkers of trachoma, IgG antibody responses in children could enable more accurate predictions because they integrate exposure over time and reflect recent transmission. Aims: The principal aims of this study are to evaluate whether antibody measurements can identify stable hotspots of trachoma infection, and whether a novel machine learning approach can accurately predict village- level trachoma infection forward in time (up to 3 years). We hypothesize that infection will be concentrated in the population and that hotspots of infection will be at the village level. We further hypothesize that antibody measurements in young children will provide a stable source of information about trachoma transmission that will enable us to accurately predict villages with high levels of future C. trachomatis infection. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we will draw on measurements from a well characterized population across 40 villages enrolled in a NIH-funded cluster randomized trial in Ethiopia’s Amhara Region (U10-EY023939). The three-year trial is designed to measure the effect of improved water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) on trachoma infection in the absence of azithromycin treatment. The trial has collected clinical and biomarker measurements from approximately 2,400 children ages 0-9 years at enrollment and in annual visits over 3 years. We will characterize the spatial scale of transmission using the !-statistic, which equals the relative risk of infection within different distances of cases. We will use a permutation-based, spatial scan statistic to identify hotspots using IgG antibody and PCR measures in each year, and will determine if they are stable over time. Using geospatial ensemble machine learning, we will predict trachoma seroprevalence as a function of remotely sensed, geospatial information and limited enrollment characteristics. We will rank order villages by predicted seroprevalence, and will assess the proportion of PCR C. trachomatis infections in top-ranked villages 1, 2, and 3 years later. We will repeat the analysis using predicted clinical symptoms as a comparator. The development of methods to make accurate, fine-scale predictions of future C. trachomatis infection will lay the groundwork for a future adaptive randomized trial that preferentially allocates more intensive intervention to villages predicted at enrollment to have high future levels of infection. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Trachoma control programs target and monitor activities at the level of districts, but it is likely that infection hotspots are concentrated at much smaller scales and could be missed in district-level averages. We propose to combine antibody-based measures of exposure with state-of-the-art machine learning to develop predictions of trachoma infection at the scale of individual villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which would represent a substantial increase in the resolution of information available to guide control and monitoring efforts.",Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future  infection,9974479,R03AI147128,"['Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Azithromycin', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Cholera', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethiopia', 'Eye Infections', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handwashing', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hygiene', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relative Risks', 'Resolution', 'Sanitation', 'Scanning', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'remote sensing', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'transmission process']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2020,87707,-0.0031930878133724925
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",9850968,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'hepatocellular injury', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,442592,-0.013221238726901294
"Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and Recovery (Pred-MAKER) in COVID-19 Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  Major adverse kidney events (MAKE) are common in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, particularly in the United States. Our data from Mount Sinai show that ~40% of hospitalized patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI); 20% of those need renal replacement therapy, and the mortality rate in patients that experience COVID-19 associated AKI is several-fold greater than patients without AKI. Furthermore, we have seen that the rate of non-recovery is also significantly higher compared to those observed in non-COVID AKI, highlighting the potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2-associated kidney damage. We propose to utilize the highly coordinated tissue and biospecimen collection machinery that has been initiated at the Mount Sinai Health System. As the largest hospital system at the epicenter of the crisis, Mount Sinai treated and discharged nearly 10,000 COVID-19 patients and created a central IRB approval and data coordination system under the auspices of the newly formed Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center. As part of biospecimen and clinical data collation efforts, we have consented and obtained blood, urine or clinically indicated kidney biopsy samples from over 700 patients at the time of admission.  Using these samples, we propose (1) to use a multipronged approach to determine the biomarkers that are associated with MAKE; (2) to develop a machine learning-based predictive algorithm using a combination of multiplexed biomarker expression levels and clinical metrics; and, (3) to determine cellular pathways that are responsible for COVID-associated AKI by combining multiomics interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 positive patient urine and kidney biopsies as well as the time-dependent transcriptomic signatures of in vitro primary proximal tubule cells.  First, our results will have an immediate translational outcome, which will help focus clinical efforts on high risk patients and triage low risk patients quicker. In addition, our proposal will lead to improved understanding of the complex disease mechanisms that cause the unique kidney injury signatures in COVID-19 and may lead to development of novel biomarkers and therapeutics that may prove beneficial during post-COVID clinical care. Our rigorous approach is innovative, and it is supported by established complementary assays. We have assembled an experienced multidisciplinary team encompassing bioengineers, nephrologists, basic scientists, informaticians and virologists that will help improve the understanding of the landscape of kidney outcomes during COVID-19 hospitalizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Kidney podocytes play an important role in kidney filtration. In order to perform this key biological function, the podocyte has to maintain a specialized structure that depends on a number of proteins. We identified a previously unknown protein, called nebulette, as a key component of the podocyte filtration machinery, and we propose to test its role in maintenance of the specialized structure of podocytes during health and disease. Our results will improve our understanding of podocyte biology and may identify new drug targets to treat kidney diseases such as diabetic nephropathy.",Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and Recovery (Pred-MAKER) in COVID-19 Patients,10216732,R01DK118222,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coca', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Consultations', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health system', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nephrology', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteinuria', 'Proteomics', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Triage', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney biopsy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'podocyte', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'proteomic signature', 'renal damage', 'response', 'sample collection', 'spatiotemporal', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'virology']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,468762,0.004196902822963158
"NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume Project Summary  Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) and neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) impose major health threats on neonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal infections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is permanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and remain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad range of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection, despite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).  Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA or RNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves, or “fingerprints”, are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. These unique microbial “fingerprints” are then automatically identified and quantified using machine learning technology, with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1 mL), in a platform called NeoChip. Presently, we have established unique signature melt curves for 40 bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance genes that commonly infect neonates. Additionally, NeoChip has been expanded to distinguish individually amplified melt curve signatures for multiple pathogen identification and quantification, as required for polymicrobial infection.  In this proposal, we will build out NeoChip’s comprehensive database by incorporating clinical strains of CMV and HSV with actionable antiviral resistance genes. Because NeoChip identifies variances in nucleic acid sequences, individual differentiation and quantification of CMV and HSV strains are possible. We will also translate the NeoChip for specific and rapid diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection in a large prospective clinical study of pregnant women and their offspring(s), as well as directly compare the platform to standard quantitative nucleic acid test (QNAT) assays, IgG/IgM antibody testing, and clinical outcome measures for statistical concordance (predictive value). Finally, we will validate and translate NeoChip for cCMV detection and clinical correlation using dried blood spot (DBS) samples for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening programs. NeoChip’s goal is to provide an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of pathogen etiology (viral, bacterial, and fungal) in a single test with efficacy on broad tissue matrices and capacity to inform microbial resistance, thereby facilitating early administration of targeted antimicrobials and therapeutics. This proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to address the biomedical challenges of rapidly and accurately diagnosing cCMV and nHSV to facilitate disease prognostication and early therapeutic or intervention programs. Project Narrative NeoChip combines real-time PCR, digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA and RNA, and machine learning to create unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antimicrobial resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection of pathogen(s) causing neonatal infection. This project will build out NeoChip’s melt curve database to include clinically relevant strains of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infections, while concordantly assembling updated epidemiologic timelines and prevalence of perinatal CMV and HSV transmission. Our goals are to validate NeoChip for the rapid and specific diagnosis of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infection on multiple tissue matrices and translate the NeoChip platform for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening for the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus on dried blood spot samples.",NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume,10050866,R01HD099250,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral resistance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Congenital herpes simplex', 'Consumption', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simplexvirus', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus Diseases', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'congenital cytomegalovirus', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'digital', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intervention program', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal infection', 'neonate', 'next generation sequencing', 'offspring', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'screening program', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'viral detection']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,671761,0.010860591123795721
"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10050030,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,535171,-0.04470997328583084
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9889134,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,356625,-0.035652129104777865

The incidence of anal cancer is high among all groups of Hispanic people living with HIV (PLWH), especially among those in Puerto Rico (PR). HPV infection is necessary but insufficient for the development of anal HSIL and cancer. The goal of this supplement is to elucidate the role of the anal microbiome as a contributor to this increased risk of anal cancer risk in these high-risk populations. Specific aims are 1) Study the relationship between anal high- risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH in California, Mexico and PR; and 2) Study the relationship between anal HSIL and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH with anal hr-HPV infection. These populations are of particular interest given their divergent lifestyles but similarity in genetic background. We hypothesize that among Hispanic PLWH without anal HSIL, the microbiome will be different among those with and without hr-HPV infection. We hypothesize that the proportion with pro-inflammatory-mediating taxa will be highest among the PR population compared with the Mexican and California populations given the higher incidence in anal cancer in PR. We also hypothesize that among Hispanic PLWH with anal hr-HPV at the 3 locations, detection of HSIL will be associated with a pro-inflammatory microbiome and a decrease in butyrate-producing signatures, with the proportion with pro-inflammatory changes highest in PR compared with the other populations.  We will enroll 100 PLWH (50 men and 50 women) at each of the PR, Mexico City and San Francisco CAMPO sites, for a total of 300 Hispanic PLWH. Data on anal HPV, anal cytology and anal HSIL will be available through CAMPO Study 1 in PR and Mexico City, and from the San Francisco ANCRE Clinic, where PLWH are screened for anal HSIL as part of routine clinical care. A validated food frequency questionnaire in Spanish will be administered to assess dietary intake for the previous 3 and 6 months. Anal swab specimens will be retrieved from the CAMPO Biorepository and used for microbiome analysis. The 16S gene will be amplified from extracted anal swab genomic DNA and subjected to Illumina Miseq. Sequences of the 16S gene V4 region will be analyzed in QIIME2. Random forest classification will be performed to understand how our predictors, i.e. microbiome variables (diversity measurements, species-level taxa) and other covariates (sociodemographics, sex, diet, clinical data, etc.), are associated with hr-HPV infection or HSIL (outcomes). Narrative As the incidence of anal cancer is high in Hispanic people living with HIV (PLWH), especially in Puerto Rico, this supplement aims to study the relationship between anal high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection, anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH in California, Mexico and Puerto Rico (PR). Building on the parent U54 California-Mexico-Puerto Rico (CAMPO) Consortium infrastructure, we will enroll 300 Hispanic PLWH from the study sites, collect anal swabs for anal HPV testing, cytology and microbiome analysis, perform high resolution anoscopy and collect data to assess dietary intake. The anal microbiota profiles will be analyzed among the three Hispanic populations and will shed light on the role of the anal microbiome in potentiating anal HPV-related anal disease in these high- risk populations.",CAMPO Global Cancer Health Disparities Supplement,10166395,U54CA242646,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Biopsy', 'Butyrates', 'California', 'Cervical', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Hispanics', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Latin America', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of anus', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncoproteins', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Puerto Rico', 'Questionnaires', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Squamous intraepithelial lesion', 'Swab', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'biobank', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer risk', 'cervical and anal cancer', 'clinical care', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'interest', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'microbiota profiles', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'therapeutic vaccine']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U54,2020,194934,-0.08177121649559276
"Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma Project Summary Glaucoma damage to the optic nerve and impairment of vision are progressive and irreversible. Understanding mechanisms of glaucomatous injury will help to develop new approaches for treatments that can be used along with traditional therapies that lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography have brought increased attention to the role of the inner retinal circulation in glaucoma. To improve our understanding of retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma, we can take advantage of recent developments in visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) to characterize simultaneously tissue structure, vessel density, blood flow and oxygenation. The goal of this project is to further advance vis-OCT by attaining capillary-level measurements, test the value of measuring their local alterations as early indicators of glaucoma and glaucomatous progression and use this to evaluate impaired retinal autoregulation from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss as a potential cause of increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop high-speed, high-sensitivity, high-resolution vis-OCT. The speed will be double that of the current system. A more stable supercontinuum laser will be used to improve system sensitivity, and a tighter focus will be used to improve lateral resolution. This will enable complete detection of capillaries that may be vulnerable to vascular dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will develop quantitative OCT angiography, velocimetry and oximetry in capillaries as well as arteries and veins. Building on the high-resolution, high-contrast scans acquired in Aim 1, we will use machine learning to segment capillary plexuses, and advanced image processing to extract capillary architecture. Aided by this capillary architecture, we will automatically measure blood flow and oxygenation in capillary segments and incorporate them into a real-time platform. Specific Aim 3 will use this system to demonstrate that acute loss of RGCs, produced by optic nerve transection, alters retinal capillary plexus density, oximetry and velocimetry over time and that these changes precede altered oximetry and flow in larger retinal vessels. We will also show that loss of RGCs impairs the autoregulatory response to acute IOP challenge. In Specific Aim 4, we will demonstrate that optic nerve injury in a model of controlled, elevated IOP produces early alterations in capillary velocimetry, oximetry and autoregulation, show that they are more persistent with advanced injury, and demonstrate the pathophysiologic consequences of these observations. Successful development of this new technology will improve methods of early glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression. Better understanding of retinal vascular factors that lead to increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma will lead to improved treatments for these highly vulnerable patients. Project Narrative This project will develop advanced technology to image retinal capillaries and measure capillary blood flow and oxygen content. This may provide an early indicator of glaucoma progression and help study a potential cause of increased susceptibility to intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.","Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma",9944107,R01EY031394,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abbreviations', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Axon', 'Blindness', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Computer software', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Glaucoma', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intraocular pressure test', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Optic Nerve Transections', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Structure of central vein of the retina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Veins', 'Velocimetries', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'attenuation', 'automated segmentation', 'central retinal artery', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabolic rate', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prototype', 'response', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'retina circulation', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal ischemia', 'traditional therapy', 'vascular factor']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,552591,0.0024623342773522137
"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 Abstract With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic. As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to battle the disease. Access to such information will equip frontline health workers to continue the fight against the disease. This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via REDCap and a mobile application (app) to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a REDCap database and mobile app that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. Project Narrative COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10136980,R01AI127203,"['2019-nCoV', 'Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Common Cold', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Partners', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'big-data science', 'combat', 'data infrastructure', 'data management', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene therapy', 'health data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'patient privacy', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'systems research', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,626275,-0.03828216736350276
"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10010769,R44EY031202,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drusen', 'Ear', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Lasers', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'New York', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trademark', 'Treatment Cost', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitamins', 'age related', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care costs', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'photobiomodulation', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2020,585067,-0.028820529238923264
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,10006790,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'data streams', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'feature selection', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,722295,-0.006630425738046165
"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease.

"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9985180,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model', 'treatment comparison']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2020,277764,-0.008567467335676884
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9981804,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'microSPECT', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,601275,-0.004617398112244158
"Innate responses following infection with enteric microbes ABSTRACT As the rapidly unfolding COVID-19 pandemic claims its victims around the world, it has also inspired the scientific community to come up with solutions to meet an urgent and unmet need —i.e., ameliorate the severity of Covid- 19 and reduce mortality. Two obstacles make that task difficult—First, the pathophysiology of Covid-19 remains a mystery; the emerging reports generally agree that the disease has a very slow onset and that those who succumb typically mount a ‘cytokine storm’, i.e., an overzealous immune response. However, despite being implicated as a culprit behind the observed mortality and morbidity in COVID-19, we know virtually nothing about what constitutes (nature, extent) or contributes to (cell or origin) such an overzealous response. A significant number of patients have GI symptoms. The treatment goals in COVID-19 have been formulated largely as a ‘trial and error’-approach; this is reflected in the mixed results of the trials that have concluded. Second, the process of drug discovery is comprised of time-consuming steps; to avoid delays, we need to define the nature of the fatal cellular response before deciding how to model it in animals or matching therapeutics to curb it.  Our preliminary work has helped us define the aberrant host cellular response in COVID-19. We used machine learning tools that can look beyond interindividual variability to extract underlying gene expression patterns within complex data across multiple cohorts of viral pandemics, including COVID-19. The resultant pattern, i.e., signature, was subsequently exploited as a predictive model to navigate COVID-19 for GI symptoms. Surprisingly, the 166-gene signature was conserved in all viral pandemics, including COVID-19, inspiring the nomenclature-- (ViP)-signature. The ViP signature identified and predicted the disease severity of SARS-CoV2-infected patients. We hypothesized that the ViP signature provides a quantitative and qualitative framework for titrating the cellular response in viral pandemics and could serve as a powerful unbiased tool in our armamentarium to vet candidate drugs rapidly. In this proposal, our predicted model, experimental datasets and the information from published literature will be used to screen drugs/nutritional components/probiotics in the GI organoid derived monolayers in a semi-HTP format. We will experimentally validate the effect of the therapeutics predicted in ViP gene signature of the host. The following two aims will provide a translational impact on the COVID-19 emergency. Aim 1: Identify the gastro-intestinal pathogenic pathways during COVID-19. Aim 2: Determine the impact of drugs, nutrients and supplements in gut-in-a-dish model of COVID-19. Impact: This proposal will identify the gastro-intestinal pathways (in healthy and patients with chronic diseases) involved in the GI symptoms of COVID 19 and provide new treatment options in COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) continues to rapidly claim lives and challenge the limits of our knowledge and our healthcare system. Other than “cytokine storm,” a significant amount of the patient shows gastrointestinal symptoms and nothing is known for the cellular pathways and any relevant treatment of COVID-19. The published literature, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-guided approaches, and our experimental datasets with GI- organoid-based cell models are used to identify host gastrointestinal pathways that can be targeted using drug/pro-prebiotics and nutritional supplements to combat the disease.",Innate responses following infection with enteric microbes,10177672,R01DK107585,"['2019-nCoV', 'Abdominal Pain', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'China', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'Duodenum', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enteral', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Esophagus', 'Feces', 'Formalin', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'IL8 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Interleukin-15', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Lower Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Nature', 'Nausea', 'Neutral Amino Acid Transport Systems', 'Nomenclature', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prodrugs', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'Rectum', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Intestines', 'Specimen', 'Stomach', 'Supportive care', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'VIP gene', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biosafety level 3 facility', 'cohort', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'dietary supplements', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal infection', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'genetic signature', 'gut microbiota', 'ileum', 'intestinal epithelium', 'microbial', 'monolayer', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'prebiotics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'transmission process', 'viral RNA', 'virtual']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,354469,-0.024065624304725114
"Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS) is a common chromosomal disorder that results from the triplication of chromosome 21. Comorbid medical conditions frequently occur among individuals with DS; however, opthalamic disorders such as keratoconus occurs 6 times more often among this population as compared to the general population. Keratoconus is a known multifactorial, progressive, degenerative disease of the cornea; however, the etiology of the disease remains unclear. Our recent work has found that hormone-regulated Prolactin-Induced Protein (PIP) is a potential biomarker of keratoconus but the link between DS and keratoconus remains unclear. Pathway analysis has further linked comorbid DS and keratoconus through gonadotropins and serum amyloid A1 (SAA), a protein linked in a series of studies to cognitive dysfunction among adults with DS. The proposed study aims to determine and validate the role of gonadotropins in the DS population with the keratoconus co-morbidity with the long-term goal to better understand the underlying mechanisms that result in increased risk for ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus among this population. This pilot study will include n=90 participants (n=30 DS; n=30 comorbid DS and Keratoconus; n=30 healthy controls). All participants will provide biofluid samples of tears and plasma, which will be assayed on an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) platform. Analyses will be performed using R and SPSS 24 (IBM) in a series of steps. Support Vector Machine (SVM) analyses will be applied to examine the use of biomarkers to detect disease presence (i.e. keratoconus comorbidity). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses will help with variable selection in order to enhance the prediction accuracy of the models. Biomarkers will include hormone specific (LSH, LH, GNRH, LHR, FSHR, GNRHR) as well as a panel of plasma proteins including biomarkers of inflammation linked with cognitive dysfunction (SAA, CRP, ICAM1, VCAM1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-5, IL-7, Eotaxin-3, TARC, A2M, B2M, FVII, TNC, Adiponectin, FABP-3, IL-18, PPY, TPO and I-309). Diagnosis of keratoconus will be utilized as the dependent variable. If successful, data obtained from this study could help facility the development of a screening tool for detecting individuals with DS who are at risk for development of keratoconus, with the goal of defining potential enrollment into clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Vision disorders occur in nearly all individuals with Down syndrome (DS) with development of ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus, a cornea dystrophy, occurring 6 times more often in this population as compared to the general population. Recent work from our group has found differences in sex hormones (i.e. androgen and estrogen levels) among individuals with keratoconus as compared to healthy controls but this difference was impacted by age and gender. Information gained from this study will (1) reveal the relationship between gonadotropins among individuals with DS and ocular comorbidities, specifically keratoconus, and (2) provide insight into the association between known plasma biomarkers including serum amyloid A1 and gonadotrophins among those with DS as well as those with comorbid keratoconus and DS.",Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome,10108508,R21EY032320,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Androgens', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blepharitis', 'Blood', 'CCL1 gene', 'CCL17 gene', 'CCL26 gene', 'Cataract', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome 21', 'Clinical Trials', 'Congenital chromosomal disease', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Corneal dystrophy', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Eye Development', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Future', 'GNRH1 gene', 'GNRH2 gene', 'GNRHR gene', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Hormones', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Gonadotropins', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'ICAM1 gene', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-7', 'Keratoconus', 'Lacrimal Duct Obstruction', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Nystagmus', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prolactin', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Readiness', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Strabismus', 'TNF gene', 'Thinness', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visual Acuity', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'insight', 'link protein', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'programs', 'receptor', 'sex', 'support vector machine']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,403584,-0.011420477795518523
"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award.

"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction.

"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform.

"Antibodies as Drugs ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Antibodies as Drugs organized by Drs. Pierre Bruhns, Patrick C. Wilson, Esther Breij and David P. Humphreys. The conference will be held in Whistler, British Columbia from January 27-30, 2021. Therapeutic antibodies continue to largely populate the list of top biologic drugs. They revolutionize the treatment of pathologies falling into major disease areas, which include cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, allergy and infectious diseases. As more antibodies are being tested to treat an expanding number of pathologies, there has also been a concomitant increase in the frequency of resistance and escape mechanisms. Thus, researchers are exploring alternative concepts to prevent unresponsiveness or treat resistant patients. Therefore, not only are new methodological and technological advances being developed, paradigm-shifting concepts are being developed in order to face these challenges. This conference in the Keystone Symposia series on Antibodies as Drugs aims to present the state-of-the-art in antibody therapeutics, repertoires and deep learning, bispecific antibodies and engineering. This conference will provide a forum for extensive interactions between investigators from both industry and academia. Goals of this conference include discussion of recent breakthroughs in identifying therapeutics from patients, understanding vaccination and mode of delivery, modalities for half-life extensions and involvement of complement in antibody mode of action. It is anticipated that research in the field will showcase the rise of bispecific antibodies and highlight the technologies to develop them, improve their functionalities, and boost clinical efficacies, particularly in immune-oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The success of early antibody approaches has been tremendous and now they have revolutionized treatment for many major disease areas, such as cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, allergy and infectious diseases. However, as more antibodies are being tested to treat an expanding number of pathologies, then more resistance and escape mechanisms are being found, forcing scientists to search for alternative concepts to prevent unresponsiveness or treat resistant patients. Therefore, this conference will gather scientists from many different disciplines, including structural and cellular immunology, biology, engineering, chemistry and medicine, to share ideas and help develop novel antibody therapeutics.",Antibodies as Drugs,10071067,R13AI154980,"['Academia', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bispecific Antibodies', 'British Columbia', 'Cellular Immunology', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunooncology', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Extension', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccination', 'antibody engineering', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'falls', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'posters', 'prevent', 'resistance frequency', 'success', 'symposium']",NIAID,KEYSTONE SYMPOSIA,R13,2020,11500,-0.012374380982593372
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9844413,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,352587,-0.009506073327171165
"Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system’s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden in 2011, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. One of the major challenges facing clinicians is to identify and recognize patients with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and the signs of infection and organ dysfunction can be subtle and may mimic other conditions. Sepsis is also highly time critical. Every 1-hour delay in antibiotics after emergency department (ED) triage or the onset of organ dysfunction or shock is associated with a 3–7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. These conditions have created an environment where physicians have to diagnose a complex, heterogeneous condition in a short timeframe with limited information. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments. This dataset & biobank currently have >2,000 patients, >70,000 proprietary biomarker measurements, >1,200,000 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) parameters, and >25,000 samples banked (all with accompanying full time series EMR data). We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this proposed project, Prenosis will finalize the first version of the NOSISTM platform by growing our current proprietary dataset & biobank from its current size of about 2,000 patients to over 10,000 total patients (Aim 1). Using the current 2,000 patient dataset, we have demonstrated initial promising endotypes of sepsis that could be useful for a variety of critical clinical problems. As we grow the dataset to 10,000 patients, we will use unsupervised machine learning algorithms trained on roughly half of the patients (5,000) to definitively prove the robustness and usefulness of these endotypes. The other half of the patients (other 5,000) will be used as a multi-site validation cohort for the endotypes determined by the ML algorithms (Aim 2). We will also finalize the actual software platform for the NOSISTM product (Aim 3), including data security, restricted access by collaborators to train and jointly develop products, and templates for business partnerships with potential collaborators (with an initial focus on HIT companies and pharma companies). Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Narrative: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the world’s largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments.

We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this project, we are proposing work to finalize our NOSISTM product. NOSISTM is a software platform that allows collaborators (hospital IT departments, researchers, health information technology (HIT) companies, drug companies, and government agencies) to utilize the constantly growing proprietary Prenosis dataset & accompanying data-rich biobank. Using NOSISTM, collaborators can develop new sepsis screening technologies and clinical decision support tools, dramatically increase success of clinical drug trials, and revolutionize our scientific understanding of the endotypes of dysregulation of host response.",Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset,10082229,R44GM139529,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Businesses', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Security Measures', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'data hosting', 'encryption', 'health information technology', 'machine learning algorithm', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,"PRENOSIS, INC.",R44,2020,989523,-0.015577960360764271
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9942277,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'supervised learning', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,658144,-0.005099034554075682
"Multifidelity and multiscale modeling of the spleen function in sickle cell disease with in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo validations Project Summary The spleen plays a key role in the human immune system but also clears senescent red blood cells (RBC) from the circulation and those altered by acquired or inherited diseases. In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the spleen is one of the first targets of pathogenic processes and a potential protector against major complications. Under hypoxic conditions, mutated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes to fibers which increase both the stiffness and adhesion of RBC. Splenic filtration of altered RBC prone to sickling (a process that cannot be directly observed in human subjects) contributes to anemia and likely triggers acute splenic sequestration crises (ASSC). On the other hand, it potentially prevents complications associated with intravascular sickling. Self- amplified blockade of vessels with sickled RBCs is indeed a hallmark of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and acute hepatic crises, that severely impact the life quality and expectancy of patients with SCD. We propose to formulate and validate a new predictive modeling framework for how the spleen filters altered RBC in SCD by synergistically integrating in silico, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo data using multifidelity-based neural networks (NN). This will deliver predictive models that can continuously learn when new data become available, a paradigm shift in biomedical modeling. We will develop multiscale/multifidelity computational models (and corresponding NN implementations) that link sub-cellular, cellular, and vessel level phenomena spanning across four orders of magnitude in spatio-temporal scales. This scale coupling will be accomplished using a molecular dynamics/dissipative particle dynamics (MD/DPD) framework. We will validate these predictive computational models by data from in vitro and ex vivo experiments, and RBC quantitative features collected in SCD patients. Specifically, we will use three new spleen-on-a-chip microfluidic devices with oxygen control and the unique human spleen perfusion setup of our foreign partner, with the following aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a splenic inter-endothelial slit filtration model; Aim 2: Develop new models of RBC macrophage adhesion and of phagocytosis in the spleen; Aim 3: Perform Spleen-on-a-Chip experiments and validation; Aim 4: Validate the predictive framework based on RBC samples from patients. Realization of our four Specific Aims will significantly increase our understanding of the complex pathogenic and protective roles of the spleen in SCD. Feeding our new multifidelity neural networks with morphological and functional measures of RBC circulating in SCD patients will lead to models for residual spleen function in SCD, which should help predict the risk of acute splenic sequestration crises, and guide optimal timing for Stem Cell Transplantation or Gene Therapy. The new paradigm in using deep learning tools to integrate data from different sources will be applicable to modeling many other blood diseases. Project Narrative In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), the spleen is the target of early pathogenic processes and a potential protector against major complications. We will formulate and validate predictive multiscale models for red blood cell (RBC) filtration by the spleen based on new deep learning neural networks fed with data from simulations, experiments using new spleen-mimetic microfluidics, and RBC quantitative features from ex vivo perfusion of human spleens and from SCD patients. These models will be used to predict acute splenic sequestrations crises and guide treatment decisions in patients with SCD.","Multifidelity and multiscale modeling of the spleen function in sickle cell disease with in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo validations",10052044,R01HL154150,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Adhesions', 'Adhesiveness', 'Adhesives', 'Anemia', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Endothelium', 'Erythrocytes', 'Expectancy', 'Fiber', 'Filtration', 'Goals', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hepatic', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hereditary Spherocytosis', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Paris, France', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phagocytosis', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sickle Cell', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Hemoglobin', 'Source', 'Spleen', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Surface', 'System', 'Training', 'Validation', 'acute chest syndrome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'ex vivo perfusion', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gene therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'learning progression', 'macrophage', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neural network', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'retention rate', 'senescence', 'sickling', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'vaso-occlusive crisis']",NHLBI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,705243,-0.024363090090063454
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression. Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately improving health.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression.,9861881,R01AR076440,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'FDA approved', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Joints', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'disability', 'economic impact', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint function', 'methylation pattern', 'model development', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'protein biomarkers', 'sodium bisulfite', 'subchondral bone', 'success', 'targeted sequencing']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R01,2020,21455,-0.008613766554650733
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,-0.010683928460537997
"Development of a biomarker panel for minimally-invasive screening and diagnosis of gynecological disease PROJECT SUMMARY One-third of all women of reproductive age will experience nonmenstrual pelvic pain at some point in their lives and one-third of outpatient visits to gynecologists in the U.S. are for evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding. For many women, these symptoms accompany infertility which is reported in ~10% of all US women and even higher percentages worldwide. For almost all of these women, these conditions result in a diagnostic odyssey wherein women struggle through multiple physicians over many years for a definitive diagnosis, frequently culminating in invasive laparoscopy or hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage (D&C) for definitive diagnosis. To reduce the burden of diagnosis and enable early treatment, MDDx, Inc. is developing the first biomarker- based diagnostic test to enable minimally invasive simultaneous diagnosis of four of the most common causes which together result in chronic pain, uterine bleeding and infertility: adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. MDDx, Inc. has been leveraging access to >12 years of longitudinally collected and deeply annotated biobanked uterine lavage samples from the Gynecologic Cancer Translational Research Program (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; New York, NY and Nuvance Health; Danbury, CT) to identify diagnostic autoantibodies (AAb) that could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for these benign gynecological diseases. By performing AAb profiling against the entire human proteome and applying our novel machine-learning based method for classification of molecular profiles we have determined that there is a common set of ~200 biomarkers that could be used to diagnose women with adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, or endometriosis. The goal of Phase I is to finalize and validate the optimized set of ~200 diagnostic AAbs, while Phase II will focus on validation of the commercial diagnostic assay. In Aim 1 we will expand our proprietary database of uterine lavage autoantibody profiles to ensure that we have a sample size (~935) that will enable us to confidently apply our machine learning approaches to identifying the minimal panel of AAbs for the diagnostic. We will use this enhanced database to identify a prototype panel of ~200 AAbs for construction of classification scoring functions to distinguish between adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. In Aim 2 we will perform a blinded validation and performance study using an independent set of 300 uterine lavage samples to provide proof-of- concept for clinically useful sensitivity and specificity prior to large scale prospective validation in Phase II. Successful completion of this Phase I program will identify the optimized panel of AAbs for an affordable, laboratory-based diagnostic test that will significantly reduce the number of women who will need to undergo laparoscopy or hysteroscopy with D&C for definitive diagnosis, enabling early treatment of disease and reducing the significant psychological and financial burden of diagnoses that otherwise can take years. PROJECTIVE NARRATIVE Nearly half of all women of reproductive age will experience some combination of nonmenstrual pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility in their lifetimes, yet there are no non-invasive methods to definitively diagnose the primary causes of these symptoms. MDDx, Inc. is developing the first laboratory diagnostic test to enable minimally invasive simultaneous diagnosis of four common causes of these often debilitating symptoms and infertility: adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. This test will enable early detection, early treatment, and reduce the physical, emotional, and financial burden of obtaining a diagnosis for women suffering from these common yet disruptive symptoms.",Development of a biomarker panel for minimally-invasive screening and diagnosis of gynecological disease,10146682,R41HD104402,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasias', 'Autoantibodies', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dilatation and Curettage', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Endometrial Carcinoma', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Evaluation', 'Female Genital Diseases', 'Financial Hardship', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Gynecologist', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Hysteroscopy', 'Image', 'Infertility', 'Irrigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laparoscopy', 'Leiomyoma', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'New York', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preneoplastic Conditions', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Uterine Polyp', 'Uterine hemorrhage', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker panel', 'chronic pain', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic panel', 'disabling symptom', 'disease diagnosis', 'endometriosis', 'experience', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'medical schools', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'translational research program', 'uterus endometriosis']",NICHD,"MDDX, INC.",R41,2020,299998,-0.03953929594711559

"A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases ABSTRACT  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF- 1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.  The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA- sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury based on mechanistic terms. NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease is a global health epidemic and is associated with increased mortality, but we do not have a detailed understanding of why this disease progresses. Identifying sub-types of patients who progress by the same molecular mechanism is important to identify patients for future clinical trials. This project aims to use gene expression data from kidney biopsies to identify patients who will respond differently to medications that increase the expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha.",A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases,9948349,K08DK124449,"['Address', 'Anemia', 'Animals', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemic', 'Erythropoietin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia Inducible Factor', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Native Americans', 'Nephrology', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pima Indian', 'Process', 'Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'experience', 'global health', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2020,168955,-0.011555686300166483
"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,10002324,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'complex data ', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'feature extraction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2020,869698,0.0028242140246295005
"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations. Project Narrative The public health relevance of this proposal is that it will provide an infrastructure for analyzing impacts of dietary components and microbiomes throughout the body. The analysis of these maps will help us identify dietary components that improve resistance to infectious disease.",Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity,10015205,DP1AT010885,"['3-Dimensional', 'American', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Back', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consumption', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Disease Resistance', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Liquid substance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Microbe', 'Minerals', 'Miniaturization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutritional status', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phytochemical', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'human subject', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'nanolitre scale', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'side effect', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP1,2020,885000,-0.020873026912749233
"Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract  In 2016, 47,000 individuals who initiated dialysis in the United States (~42% of all incident dialysis patients that year) had obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kilograms per meters squared. Across the BMI spectrum, individuals with kidney disease commonly lose weight after initiating dialysis treatment. However, whereas body weight typically stabilizes after the first several months of dialysis among patients without obesity, those with obesity often continue to lose weight. Both people with and without obesity who are on dialysis may lose weight due to muscle wasting and malnutrition, and recent studies have identified weight loss as a risk factor for death among people on dialysis, independent of BMI. Yet, some of the weight loss observed among obese dialysis patients may also reflect deliberate attempts to improve health, mobility, or access to kidney transplantation. Currently, there are no guidelines to help clinicians to differentiate between healthy and high-risk weight loss among people with obesity on dialysis. Further, typical obesity management paradigms are not easily transferrable to obese people with end-stage kidney disease, given factors such as chronic malnutrition, inflammation, and sarcopenia in this population that may modify the risks and benefits of different weight loss strategies. Therefore, the overarching goal of this five-year research proposal is to define healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes among people with obesity who are on dialysis, and to provide clinically feasible tools to improve obesity management in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. We will accomplish this goal by conducting three distinct but interrelated studies. In the first study, we will qualitatively determine patient-prioritized endpoints of weight loss, in addition to patient, physician and other stakeholder perspectives on the key factors that differentiate healthy from high-risk weight loss on dialysis. In the second study, we will leverage a national dataset of 23,000 obese dialysis patients and apply constructs of high and low physiologic reserve to derive healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes. We will then develop a weight- loss risk calculator tool that predicts the risks of hospitalization and death that are associated with each weight loss phenotype, using dynamic predictive joint models and machine learning techniques. In the third study, we will enroll 250 obese dialysis patients in a prospective, longitudinal study across five regions in the United States to evaluate the association between nutritional, inflammatory, and hemodynamic biomarkers and measures of health trajectory that are not typically captured in registry data, such as sarcopenia, dynapenia, body composition, and patient-prioritized endpoints such as quality of life. In accomplishing its aims, this research will provide urgently needed knowledge and tools that will improve the medical management of tens of thousands of people with end-stage kidney disease and obesity, ensuring that clinicians will be better able to incorporate patient-prioritized outcomes into assessments of weight loss interventions, and recognize and mitigate the effects of high-risk weight loss. Project Narrative Although over 40,000 obese individuals with end-stage kidney disease initiate dialysis each year in the United States, there are no guidelines on optimal obesity management in the setting of dialysis care. Obese dialysis patients may lose weight due to chronic illness or due to intentional weight loss attempts, though it is difficult to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss in these patients. This proposal seeks to advance the science of obesity management in dialysis settings by providing new tools to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss trajectories among obese dialysis patients.",Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease,9943129,R01DK124388,"['Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dietitian', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Kilogram', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Nephrology', 'Non obese', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Transplant Recipients', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'experience', 'hazard', 'health related quality of life', 'healthy weight', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity management', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'sleep quality', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,301998,-0.03145729693190887
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,10000112,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'ZIKA', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computational platform', 'computer infrastructure', 'data infrastructure', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'economic determinant', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector control', 'vector-borne']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,365601,0.001948107650611562
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9927686,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,340025,-0.0019006529831322708
"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients. In this application Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will partner with Cancer Genetics, Inc. to develop a multi-omics clinical decision assay that will improve long-term outcomes for patients with advanced myeloma and generate valuable insights and tools that can be broadly leveraged for other disease indications.",Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy,9981389,R01CA244899,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Bone Marrow', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Employment', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Intestines', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'efficacy testing', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pilot trial', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'relapse patients', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,519735,-0.03640606319232631
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR .

"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9975215,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,170639,-0.022787176263500592

Within our R01 award, to analyze NMR metabolome data we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on recent developments in machine learning. We have coded these algorithms and tested their sensitivity and specificity on both synthesized and real data. We then applied these methods to human disease models and identified putative biomarkers. To validate these biomarkers, we have developed methods to analyze animal tissues and human brain organoids using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), which permits spatial localization of metabolites without labeling. This targeted IMS metabolic phenotyping approach complements our untargeted NMR methods: it allows us to determine whether the individual metabolites identified by NMR represent bona fide biomarkers and to develop metabolic hypotheses for their association with disease. We submit this request for imaging mass spectrometer hardware because a nearby IMS facility on which we have relied has closed and no other IMS facility exists in greater Houston area. Performing the IMS studies ourselves, with the help of collaborators, will accelerate our discovery about the role small molecules and metabolites play in health and disease. This instrument will help us better i) perform metabolome screens to identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on neural cell types in human brain organoid models; ii) perform high-throughput drug screening to stimulate neural stem cells to produce new neurons in the brain organoid models to regenerate damaged tissue; and iii) use our NMR algorithms to develop a protocol for quantitative imaging. None of these studies will be possible without the imaging mass spectrometer. Given our access to state-of-the-art equipment, data-collection expertise, and new analytical algorithms that are especially sensitive and specific to NMR spectral data, we are uniquely positioned to advance biomarker and diagnostics tools and screening methods for metabolites and synthetic small molecules. Using an imaging mass spectrometer to map metabolite distribution may help us discover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for a broad spectrum of brain disorders that lead to neurodegeneration. Such broad usage of our platform would be transformative for neuroscientists, neurologists, and their patients. NARRATIVE The metabolome is a dynamic and sensitive biological system that reflects both innate processes and environmental influences, and can therefore tell us much about an organism's health and homeostasis. In our R01, we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms to analyze NMR metabolome data.

"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,9895377,R21AI144433,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biosensor', 'Birds', 'Canis familiaris', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Equus caballus', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lectin', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sea', 'Sialic Acids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Strategic Planning', 'Streptavidin', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tropism', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'carbohydrate receptor', 'carbohydrate structure', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu transmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'microorganism', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protein profiling', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'respiratory', 'response', 'swine influenza', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'viral transmission', 'wild bird']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2020,239725,-0.0019681240144725372
"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America. The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) project will provide a nimble and flexible network of surveillance sites in Central and South America coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter these threats to public health.",Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO),9968994,U01AI151807,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Americas', 'Animals', 'Arbovirus Infections', 'Arboviruses', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biodiversity', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brazil', 'Central America', 'Chikungunya virus', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Deforestation', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Habitats', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Panama', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'South America', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Venezuela', 'Virus', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'ZIKA', 'Zika Virus', 'Zoonoses', 'chikungunya', 'climate change', 'cohort', 'design', 'enzootic', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'insight', 'nanobodies', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prospective', 'seroconversion', 'surveillance network', 'transmission process', 'vector', 'vector control', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,U01,2020,1615615,-0.0101768620145583
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,9995722,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,395738,0.00036764384936478496
"Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions. The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome- based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the response to treatment. Project Narrative Patients with tuberculosis (TB) can benefit greatly if we could identify signs of poor response earlier and adjust therapy intensity accordingly. Innovations in DNA isolation and sequencing technologies now enable the study of TB pathogen populations in an individual patient with very high resolution. Here, we propose to use these technologies and a highly well-characterized cohort of South African TB patients to investigate how pathogen population genetic changes link to pathogen survival and treatment response, laying the foundation for improvements in clinical treatment monitoring using DNA sequencing.",Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics,10100014,R01AI155765,"['Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Attenuated', 'Bacteria', 'Biohazardous Substance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cobalamin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Drug resistance', 'ELF3 gene', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Iron', 'Isoniazid resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Minor', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Race', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Rifampin', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'high risk', 'immunological status', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'resistance gene', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,781859,-0.023653144289814364
"Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NCI’s mission to support research into the diagnosis of cancer.",Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection,9902363,R01CA215574,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'American', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Adenoma', 'Colonic Diseases', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'High grade dysplasia', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intake', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'New England', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resected', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Somatic Cell', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer screening', 'colon carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'fecal microbiome', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'screening', 'stool sample', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,340154,-0.004197316771438243
"Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Summary: Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Current investigation of mechanisms underlying many diseases relies on the acquisition of multi-dimensional genomics data. The utility of these data is, however, offset by the lag in development of tools and models to fully interrogate them. In the context of infectious diseases, such data contains molecular information including gene transcription, regulation, and variations from both the infecting pathogen and the host cell, providing a snapshot of the host and pathogen interactions (HPIs). These HPIs determine infection outcomes. For instance, when a pathogen evades, or evolves resistance to defensive host immunity via a multifaceted HPI, it can result in persisting infection, chronic inflammation, malignant transformation, and/or elevated mortality. Recent successes in overcoming immune-evasion of infected tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the clinical gains that can be made by identifying and specifically targeting essential mechanisms of HPIs. Hence, precisely identifying new mode(s) of HPIs is critical for development of effective and personalized interventions. The molecular mechanisms of HPIs underpinning disease can be identified from genomics data. For example, information on whether a transcription factor (TF) regulates genes from either host or pathogen, or both, can be captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of infected host cells. This means that integrative analysis of genome-scale data can provide a platform for large-scale and unbiased detection of often multi- dimensional and novel facets of HPIs in host cells. However, there is a lack of data mining tools and models to extract such information. More importantly, the available analysis tools typically focus on data from either the host or the pathogen and not on the interactions occurring between the two, excluding us from investigating the full HPI spectrum. Thus, novel methods to determine HPIs by simultaneously modeling both host and pathogen data are critical for understanding key cellular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies. My lab specializes in developing computational models to construct HPI maps and to experimentally validate them. As proof-of-principle, we produced a comprehensive HPI map from sequencing samples from large numbers of tumors caused by Epstein–Barr virus. This map delivered unprecedented insights, identifying novel viral integrations, mutations linked to viral reactivation and providing molecular classification of tumors expected to yield individualized cancer therapy. Therefore, my lab is uniquely positioned to uncover mechanistic insights from HPIs. Our program seeks to develop new models and machine learning tools to construct HPI maps in several diseases by focusing on the following major questions: 1) how do expression, integration, and mutational landscapes of host and pathogen affect pathogenesis of disease?; 2) what is the nature of physical HPIs and cross-regulation by major host and pathogen factors that modulate gene expression, such as TFs and RNA binding proteins?; 3) how do HPIs define molecular subtypes to guide personalized treatments? We expect to identify novel HPIs and provide systems-level understanding of mechanisms critical to cell biology. Narrative Understanding how host cells and pathogens interact is key to developing new and individualized therapeutics. Here, we will develop novel computational tools and models to analyze existing and newly generated high throughput data and construct multi-dimensional host pathogen interaction maps.

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10088013,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2020,499995,-0.04035065255132883
"Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems: First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions. An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology, computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational- experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public health mission and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The gut microbiome plays roles in nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. Suitable tools, however, do not yet exist for engineering the microbial communities that constitute the human microbiome. The proposed research introduces the first molecular tools to precisely understand the functions of microbiome communities in our health and disease in order to then delineate therapeutic interventions for diseases mediated by the gut microbiota, thereby addressing NIH's public health mission.",Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities,10029354,R35GM138201,"['Address', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioreactors', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Encyclopedias', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Microbiology', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Source', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'fundamental research', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo evaluation', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'molecular dynamics', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrition', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'quantum', 'real time monitoring', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'targeted agent', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R35,2020,342713,0.0015636231004585613
"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,9945838,R01HL152083,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bilateral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Electrons', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Ventilator', 'alveolar epithelium', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial injury', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'lung injury', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor for advanced glycation endproducts', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,575013,-0.05769683452581896
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9878098,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2020,696730,-0.03474977599962524
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,9942461,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,391938,-0.010074033844702492
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",10005352,P01DK043881,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2020,1567293,-0.021362984218069526
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9853783,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2020,167900,-0.00025623861666675406
"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,9995661,R01AA028436,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Data', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'acute liver injury', 'algorithm development', 'biomarker discovery', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organ injury', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,615104,0.00643999414889148
"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,9944803,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,342100,-0.016439217991739277

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9973004,R01DK101674,"['Ablation', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cresol', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Ecosystem', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Process', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Sulfate', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Uremia', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'colon microbiota', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human subject', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstitution', 'solute', 'tool', 'translation to humans']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,690557,-0.004023002879509164
"Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in Older Patients The objective of this proposal is to develop a predictive model to identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and at risk of developing severe COVID-19. Louisiana has the 5th highest death rate per capita in the United States as of May 4th, 2020. Severe disease is seen in older individuals and those with underlying conditions. The New Orleans population is particularly susceptible to severe COVID-19 as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are rampant. After infection, acute lung injury caused by the virus must be repaired to regain lung function and avoid acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. Mounting evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 have cytokine storm syndrome, which may exacerbate multiorgan injury and risk of fibrotic complications. Lack of effective ways to identify and attenuate severe COVID-19 progression persist due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for cytokine storm syndrome and increased risk in older patients. Therefore, there is a need to determine the critical cytokine profiles responsible for severe COVID-19 progression to develop effective treatments. Further, it is essential to find a way to stage disease trajectory(ies) to identify therapeutic targets with precision to attenuate disease progression and uncover preventive strategies. Towards this end, we seek to leverage a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage to predict severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis by considering key cytokine-cell interactions. We hypothesize that the model will accurately predict quantitative changes in suites of key cytokines and matrix accumulation with varying COVID-19 progression within 10% accuracy. To accomplish this, we have assembled an investigative team at Tulane University with key expertise in virology, clinical infectious disease research, bioinformatics, and predictive mathematical models of tissue remodeling. In Aim 1 of the proposal, we will identify the critical cytokine markers linked to viral-induced lung damage and pulmonary fibrosis. This will be accomplished by leveraging machine learning to determine the biomarkers and molecular pathways characterizing progression of severe COVID-19 to focus model formulation. In Aim 2, we will predict the severity of COVID-19 in older patients. Model predictions will be compared to blood markers of COVID-19 disease in cohorts of older patients at different stages of disease progression. The model will be refined and informed by cytokine data to discern causal biological pathways and disease processes that can be tested and targeted. Our expected outcome is to have determined the critical cytokine interactions responsible for lung tissue damage and dictating pathways for varying disease trajectories in older patients. These results are expected to have an important impact as the proposed predictive model will open new avenues of research to rationally design pharmaceutical interventions for severe COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the study will provide a paradigm-shifting open-source tool to delineate target therapeutics, estimate their efficacy, and move towards development of patient-specific treatment plans for older individuals. Severe COVID-19 is seen in older individuals and those with underlying complications such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Lack of effective ways to identify and halt severe COVID-19 progression persists due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for increased risk and cytokine storm syndrome. Towards this end, in this proposal we will test our hypothesis that a mathematical model informed by key patient- specific suites of cytokines is capable of predicting patient trajectories, which will provide a strong evidence- based proof of concept for future efforts to rationally design interventions for severe COVID-19 patients.",Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in Older Patients,10162283,P20GM103629,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'Cell Communication', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibrosis', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Louisiana', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'extracellular', 'genetic predictors', 'individualized medicine', 'lung injury', 'mathematical model', 'molecular pathology', 'multiorgan injury', 'nonhuman primate', 'older patient', 'open source', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'repaired', 'research study', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'virology', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,P20,2020,379884,-0.026413360176802823
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10132152,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2020,635916,0.004183285965150264

"Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in over 50% of patients with sepsis and is associated with increased risk of mortality and other complications, including longer hospital length of stay and the development or progression of chronic kidney disease. To date, therapies for sepsis associated AKI (SA-AKI) remain largely supportive. One possible reason for the failure of targeted therapies may be the currently limited understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition. Traditionally, SA-AKI has been thought to be largely due to renal ischemia secondary to hypoperfusion. However, animal models show that SA-AKI is actually a state characterized by hyperdynamic circulation, and review of histological changes in septic patients shows a lack of acute tubular necrosis, a pathological finding often associated with renal ischemia. Rather, it appears that a combination of immunologic, toxic and inflammatory factors likely leads to SA-AKI, and intervening along these pathways may improve patient outcomes for SA-AKI. We hypothesize that within a population with SA-AKI, there are subgroups who have particular inflammatory and immunological profiles that are associated with differential outcomes and response to therapies. In the fields of asthma and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, the use of clinical data and biomarkers to identify such subpopulations, or sub-phenotypes, of disease, has led to new treatment paradigms, where individuals with a specific biological profile receive and benefit from a targeted therapy. We propose to use data from a large, established cohort of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (the Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury [EARLI] cohort) to define sub-phenotypes of SA-AKI using latent class analysis. Latent class analysis is an established method that uses mixture models to identify sub- phenotypes within a heterogenous population in an unbiased manner. Prior work using this methodology has allowed for discovery of new disease entities that inform biological pathways of cellular injury leading to organ failure. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: To identify novel sub-phenotypes of patients with SA-AKI and discover molecular targets for therapy through the incorporation of clinical and biomarker data into our latent class analysis. Aim 2: To determine whether certain sub-phenotypes are associated with differential outcomes with regards to mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, or duration of AKI. Through the studies outlined in this F32 proposal, Dr. Kwong will learn how to rigorously conduct latent class analysis as well as other unbiased analytic techniques (e.g., machine learning) and to apply these techniques to AKI. This work will effectively position Dr. Kwong for her future research studies, where she wants to identify appropriate patients for clinical trials of AKI therapies and to better define the pathophysiology of human AKI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis has been shown to be a key contributing factor for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). To date, there are no available targeted therapies for sepsis-associated AKI besides supportive care with antibiotics and fluids. The long-term goal of this project is to find new therapeutics for sepsis-associated AKI by first identifying sub-phenotypes based on clinical and biomarker profiles that may inform the molecular pathways of injury and then determining their association with adverse outcomes.",Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury,9833437,F32DK118870,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Acute Kidney Tubular Necrosis', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Allergic', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Apoptotic', 'Aspirin', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Failure', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Fluid Balance', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Oliguria', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary to', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Urine', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cell injury', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lung injury', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'renal ischemia', 'research study', 'response', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'tubular necrosis']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,81571,-0.007851424260801985
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,10266768,K99HD096125,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ductal Epithelial Cell', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Fetal Mortality Statistics', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Nephrons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'maternal serum', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pregnancy disorder', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'stillbirth', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'urinary']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2020,60858,-0.0057128866600517705
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. Biomarkers will also be tested for causality the mouse model. The Administrative Core will perform the outward- facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion Summary/Abstract - Quadrant Biosciences is developing a new diagnostic to aid in the clinical detection of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in school-aged children and young adults (13–22 years). Based on salivary microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers, Quadrant’s diagnostic will provide an accurate, objective, and non-invasive method for mTBI diagnosis. Such a method is critically needed, as the number of pediatric mTBIs is on the rise, and the developing brains of young patients are more vulnerable to the after-effects of mechanical forces, leading to a wide range of negative effects on physical, cognitive, and psychological function. The diagnosis and assessment of mTBI in adolescents are challenging and rely on subjective measures, leading many mTBIs to go undiagnosed or underreported. This results in suboptimal post-injury treatment and patient management. A biologic assay to accurately diagnose adolescent mTBI would therefore provide an invaluable guide for clinical care, potentially guiding decisions for imaging, return to play, return to school, and therapeutic interventions. While a number of potential biomarkers for objectively detecting mTBI have been proposed, including the blood biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1), recent research questions the ability of blood-based biomarkers to differentiate patients with mTBI from those with acute orthopedic trauma, particularly in pediatric populations. Moreover, these assays require venipuncture expertise that is not always available, particularly in the case of sports-related concussions, which account for nearly 1/3 of mTBIs in this patient population. To address these shortcomings, Quadrant Biosciences is creating a novel, objective diagnostic tool based on a panel of saliva miRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in patients with mTBI. Pilot studies in over 200 individuals with mTBI have identified a panel of saliva miRNAs capable of diagnosing mTBI and predicting symptom duration. In the proposed Fast Track project, Quadrant will advance development of this test by establishing a rapid, accurate method for quantifying these miRNAs and refining/validating a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate adolescents and young adults with mTBI from peers with symptomology that mimics mTBI (e.g. chronic headaches, anxiety/depression, ADHD, exercise-related fatigue, and orthopedic injury). In Phase I, Quadrant will refine a diagnostic algorithm for mTBI using a rapid quantification technique for saliva miRNAs. Machine learning will be used to develop a diagnostic algorithm that employs miRNA levels from the rapid multiplex assay alongside participant medical and demographic characteristics to predict mTBI status. In Phase II, Quadrant will validate the diagnostic algorithm for differentiating mTBI from medical conditions with overlapping symptomology in a prospective, case-control study of 2500 adolescents and young adults (age 13–22 years) to refine the saliva-based diagnostic aid for mTBI. Ultimately, Quadrant’s proposed salivary miRNA-based test will yield a minimally invasive, objective, biologic test that can aid diagnosis of mTBI, including among patients with confounding psychologic conditions. Narrative - Children and adolescents account for approximately 2/3 of the 3 million concussions that occur in the U.S. each year, placing them at risk for negative impacts on physical, cognitive, and psychological function, including poor academic performance, behavior, social interactions, and reduced subsequent employment. Unfortunately, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is underdiagnosed due to the poor sensitivity of conventional methods (neurological assessment, self-reporting, imaging, etc.) and lack of an objective, non-invasive diagnostic tool. Quadrant Biosciences’ rapid, accurate, objective aid for the diagnosis of mTBIs in adolescents and young adults will enable timely and accurate decision-making in mTBI assessment, resulting in reduced re- injury/morbidity, individualized patient management, and improved long-term patient outcomes.",Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion,10081522,R42NS119119,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Headaches', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Emergency department visit', 'Employment', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Headache', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Olfactory Nerve', 'Oral cavity', 'Orthopedics', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein C', 'RNA Sequences', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Sports', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Venipunctures', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'aging population', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical care', 'concussive symptom', 'design', 'diagnostic panel', 'differential expression', 'improved', 'mechanical force', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'minimally invasive', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'personalized management', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase', 'young adult']",NINDS,"QUADRANT BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R42,2020,380848,-0.0009085740501274289
"Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations Project Summary/Abstract Significant health disparities exist in chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in ethnically diverse populations. African Americans (AAs) have ~25% higher prevalence of CKD, 3-fold higher rate of ESRD, and the highest risk of mortality among those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45-95mL/min/1.73m2. The most significant traditional risk factors for CKD and ESRD are diabetes and hypertension accounting for >60% CKD and >70% of new ESRD cases, respectively. Non- traditional risk factors for CKD such as environmental, cultural-behavioral factors, geographic, education, insurance coverage, socioeconomic status and unequal access to optimal healthcare, disproportionately affect CKD health in ethnic minorities. The unique combination of these factors on CKD progression in the real world remains poorly defined. Identification of modifiable risk factors that may reduce CKD disparities would be invaluable to improve quality of life, life expectancy, and decrease economic burden. Simulation models have been successfully applied in other clinical domains, but are limited in CKD development and CKD progression, due to small datasets and the absence of modeling techniques using longitudinal observational health data. Further, no models have been tested in a real-world minority population to uncover the potential for interventional studies that would reduce CKD disparities on a larger scale. To our knowledge, we have created the largest, comprehensive database from electronic health records of >10 million individuals seen between 2006-2016 from a 2-year partnership between UCLA (1.8 million) and Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH; 9.2 million) systems. From the UCLA Registry population, we identified significant differences in eGFR trajectory decline between AAs and non-AAs according to baseline eGFR, indicating a pattern shift from a higher to a lower, steeper eGFR trajectory suggesting there may be critical windows for interventions to reduce CKD disparities in AAs. Race/ethnicity differences from linear mixed models of all ethnic cohorts persisted even after controlling for demographic and clinical variables known to influence eGFR trajectories. We hypothesize that the use of ethnically diverse populations in the joint UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry can identify a novel combination of CKD risk factors; and improve the performance of existing simulation models to predict CKD progression. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a machine learning-based simulation model for CKD and eGFR trajectories using the UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry; and conduct internal validation of the models and comparisons with existing CKD risk models, 2) stratify and test simulation models based on different racial/ethnic groups, including external validation based on cross-institution comparisons, and 3) conduct focus groups with UCLA primary care physicians, who manage racial/ethnic patients, to elicit their perspectives on existing and designed simulation models to reduce CKD health disparities. These innovative approaches will facilitate our long-term goal to inform clinical decision support methods to reduce/eliminate CKD health disparities. Project Narrative Disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affect the development of CKD and CKD progression in ethnic minorities. The ability to use large datasets of patient information to reduce these disparities is greatly lacking.

"Generalizable biomedical informatics strategies for predictive modeling of treatment response Identification of patients with poor and favorable treatment response prior to therapy administration is invaluable for improving patient survival and disease management. We propose to build an open-source scalable generalizable method that would assist experimentalists and clinicians on assessing patient's risk of developing therapy resistance and would establish a foundation for our long-term goal to build a platform for patient-centric clinical decision making, personalized therapeutic advice, and disease management.  We propose to develop a generalizable versatile bioinformatics paradigm that will use patient molecular profiles to PREDICT their Therapy Response, PREDICTTR, which combines network analysis, statistical modeling, and ensemble machine learning in a unique innovative way that allows accurate elucidation of complex multi-level relationships that govern treatment response. The objective of our proposed approach is two-fold: (i) uncover molecular markers and valuable candidates for therapeutic intervention, which can potentially be targeted to preclude or overcome resistance; and (ii) predict patient's response to therapy administration, which holds a long-term promise to improve disease outcome and reduce the cost of unnecessary and ineffective treatments.  Motivated by increasing cases of treatment resistance in oncology, we will apply our algorithm to elucidate (i) response to androgen targeting in prostate cancer and (ii) response to standard-of-care chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia. We will disseminate our approach through a web-based decision- making tool, which will be implemented through a Hadoop-oriented solution to (i) broaden its practical impact and (ii) establish clinical utility. Taken together, this multi-task resource is a unique innovative effort of its kind in the therapeutic resistance space with a direct broad impact on personalized therapeutic advice and disease management. Even though we will train our model in prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, our approach can be easily and broadly applicable to other therapies and diseases.  This effort will be led by an Early Stage Investigator, Antonina Mitrofanova (PI) who has extensive training and expertise in biomedical informatics and big data analytics. Her collaborative team includes Dr. Shantenu Jha (Rutgers, co-I) who is an expert in distributed systems and will advise on Hadoop development and validation; Dr. Shridar Ganesan (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide clinical and sequencing patient data and incorporate the utilization of our method into the Rutgers CINJ Molecular Tumor Board; Dr. Isaac Kim (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide additional data for validation in prostate cancer; Dr. Christopher Hourigan (NHLBI , NIH, Significant Collaborator), who will provide data for clinical validation in acute myeloid leukemia and is committed to test our web-based portal; and Dr. Scott Parrott (Rutgers, co-I), who is an expert in statistical analysis and will consult on power calculations and multiple testing corrections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identification of patients with poor and favorable treatment response prior to therapy administration is invaluable for improving patient survival and disease management. This proposal is dedicated to developing novel biomedical informatics paradigm to uncover genomic and transcriptomic mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and predict patients at risk of treatment failure, which will be shared with a wide scientific community through an open-source web-based portal. We utilize resistance to androgen-deprivation and second- generation anti-androgens in prostate cancer and resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia as our training examples, yet our paradigm can be broadly generalizable to study resistance to various therapeutic regimens and across different diseases.",Generalizable biomedical informatics strategies for predictive modeling of treatment response,10117702,R01LM013236,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Androgen Antagonists', 'Androgens', 'Atlases', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cancer Institute of New Jersey', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distributed Systems', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oncology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor stage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'androgen deprivation therapy', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genome', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical sequencing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'ineffective therapies', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'multitask', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'standard of care', 'statistical learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapy development', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'unnecessary treatment', 'web portal']",NLM,RBHS-SCHOOL/ HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS,R01,2020,323986,-0.03731964680653428
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response.

"Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While much research has been conducted on patient safety since the Institute of Medicine published “To Err is Human” in 2000, there is a comparative dearth of research on diagnostic errors in the hospital setting. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research is to better understand the incidence, causes, and risk factors for diagnostic errors in the inpatient setting. This work will provide foundational research for the development of interventions to reduce these errors, including predictive tools, targets for intervention, and a methodology for outcome assessment in future trials of interventions. To achieve this overall goal, we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) To determine the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients who die in hospital or are transferred to the ICU two days or more after admission to a general medicine service through a structured, standardized adjudication process of patient records, 2) To combine adjudication data with data from Vizient to determine which specific factors contribute to risks for diagnostic errors, and to use risk estimates to calculate incidence and impact of factors contributing to those errors, and 3)To create machine- learning models that can be used to retrospectively identify patients in whom a diagnostic error was likely to have taken place. The research will involve a retrospective evaluation of 2000 patients admitted to general medicine units at 20 US hospitals participating in a national research collaborative and which also contribute data to a benchmarking and purchasing organization (Vizient). Using the Safer-Diagnosis (Safer-Dx) and Diagnostic Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) taxonomy tools, both adapted for the inpatient setting, adjudicators will review electronic medical record data and determine the presence or absence of diagnostic errors using a rigorous training and continuous review process to ensure reliability across sites, adjudicators, and time. Standard modelling techniques will be used to understand the population-attributable risk of each of the DEER process failure points to diagnostic error as well as the contributions of several patient, provider, and system-level risk factors. Lastly, advanced machine-learning methods will be used to create models that can identify patients in whom diagnostic error occurred, with superior performance to standard approaches such as logistic regression. Together, these approaches will provide a broad and representative picture of the incidence of diagnostic errors among hospitalized patients who have suffered harm, develop models of patient and system-based factors that make a diagnostic error more or less likely, and build advanced, efficient, and scalable tools needed to support future surveillance and improvement programs for a variety of institutions. This research will establish a foundation from which healthcare systems can assess and achieve excellence in diagnosis in the inpatient setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study seeks to accurately define the incidence of diagnostic errors among patients suffering serious inpatient events in a large network of US hospitals. Without a reliable method for determining the presence of diagnostic errors across many organizations, it is not otherwise possible to understand the incidence, impact, predictors, and underlying causes of these errors, to create and optimize future solutions to reduce diagnostic errors, to directly test the effects of these solutions, or to teach physicians how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls in the future. Our study addresses these issues while being responsive to the RFA’s goals of developing robust estimates of incidence and risk and using approaches that leverage electronic data, and our approach represents a novel application of rigorous outcome adjudication and advanced modeling techniques to the problem of inpatient diagnostic errors.",Utility of Predictive Systems to identify Inpatient Diagnostic Errors: The UPSIDE Study,10020962,R01HS027369,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,496734,-0.008912847409193554
"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,9891542,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data warehouse', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2020,130488,-0.0009354932890987031
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9925731,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,653985,0.020657352160693056
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"Optimized identification of therapeutic bacterial strains in ulcerative colitis PROJECT SUMMARY Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gut inflammatory condition thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therapeutic options are only partially effective in inducing and maintaining remission, and there is currently no cure for UC. Recent studies have found the microbiome of UC patients is distinct compared to that of healthy controls, suggesting that the microbiome could be a promising therapeutic target. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been extremely successful in the treatment of colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection, further demonstrating the potential for bacterial therapeutics. The recently completed FOCUS (Faecal Microbiota Transplantation in Ulcerative Colitis) trial has demonstrated that FMT from healthy donors can induce clinical remission in 27% of UC patients compared to only 8% in the placebo group. However, we still lack an understanding of the exact mechanisms by which FMT is able to modulate disease pathogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that UC remission after FMT is induced by specific bacteria, and that accurate identification of bacterial strains will be paramount to develop microbial therapeutics for UC. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a novel ensemble method to identify bacterial species and strains from deep metagenomic data. This method combines software tools using a voting algorithm that is weighted based on the accuracy of each tool. The accuracy of this method will be tested using microbial culture collections from UC patients, in silico simulations, and a bacterial mock community as gold standards. We will then apply this approach to metagenomic data generated from the FOCUS study in order to identify bacterial strains that are associated with UC remission. This will be performed by using established supervised learning techniques, as well as through a novel method based on co- occurrence network analysis that identifies clusters of bacteria that act synergistically. Based on these results, we will finally validate our findings using a gnotobiotic model of colitis. The prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential of candidate bacteria will be tested by inoculating them to gnotobiotic mice colonized with the microbiota of UC patients and with colitis induced through the transfer of naïve T cells. Our proposal will be the first to address the question of how specific bacteria modulate disease progression in a randomized trial of FMT in UC through the development of more sensitive and accurate methods for strain characterization that can be experimentally validated. The rational design of our strategy to identify therapeutic bacteria will produce highly translational results that can be used to guide future clinical trials in UC.

"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators.

"An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. Project Summary / Abstract Diagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain, suffering and increased healthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While many diagnostic errors occur in hospital settings, emergency departments visits may be especially important to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions to admit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus, to enable a more complete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across a range of healthcare settings including clinic visits, emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectious diseases, diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures, potentially generating more cases. Second, many infectious diseases can be effectively treated, but even short delays in treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However, with the exception of a few infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis), diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact for diagnostic delays for infectious diseases. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated with infectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer science and statistics. While our research relies upon “big data”, we will also use clinical experts to review and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise in infectious diseases, emergency medicine, acute care, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, healthcare epidemiology, public health, industry, and professional infectious disease societies. Specifically, we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact of diagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data, methods and clinical experts, we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decrease diagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition, while our proposal focuses on infectious diseases, the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted to investigate non-infectious diseases and conditions. Project Narrative Diagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes, increased healthcare costs and, for some infectious diseases, outbreaks of great public health importance. We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinical guidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays. Our goal is to characterize the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of diagnostic delays for a wide range of infectious diseases to inform future interventions.","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence, risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.",10017203,R01HS027375,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,496235,0.0034145709695790182
"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10048017,K99MD014738,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aldosterone Antagonists', 'Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Attention', 'Baroreflex', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcium Channel', 'Cardiac Output', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Endocrine', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sodium Chloride', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer generated', 'data warehouse', 'experimental study', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human model', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'physiologic model', 'relating to nervous system', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,K99,2020,103817,-0.009843218570480077
"Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we generated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal (re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of not only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current renewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.  Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model, we were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring microbial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the early human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains unknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is driven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.  Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that under conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and hypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications. These modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as transcriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these offspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams onto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full spectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of maternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics data, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and offspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and molecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact. Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the root molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure. In the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal histone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and note that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and how these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.",Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity,9991796,R01DK089201,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diet', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fetus', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hepatic', 'High Fat Diet', 'Histone Code', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Individual', 'Lactation', 'Life', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phenotypic Sex', 'Plant Roots', 'Pregnancy', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'dysbiosis', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'genomic variation', 'gut microbiome', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in utero', 'insight', 'maternal condition', 'maternal microbiome', 'maternal obesity', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'mother nutrition', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,645963,-0.005786143753891364
"A Multi-Omic Platform for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Characterization and Management Project Summary/Abstract Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Due to the complex nature of PCOS, diagnosis is often delayed and options for treatment and self-management are limited. With recent developments in high-throughput, next- generation and metabolomics technologies, there is now a unique opportunity to utilize a cost- effective, multi-omic approach to study individuals with PCOS. In this application, we propose to apply these technologies to examine women with PCOS, developing a platform that is cost-effective, scalable, integrative, and highly accurate. Our multi- omic platform (FemBio) will integrate patient’s medical records, genomics, microbiome (shotgun metagenomics), and metabolomics to create a molecular profile of women with and without PCOS. This approach has the potential to provide a more comprehensive characterization of PCOS, to lead to the identification of improved diagnostic markers, and to allow for the discovery of novel targets for treatment. Moreover, we propose a prospective observational cohort study including whole genome sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome, fecal metabolomics, serum and urine hormone levels, and clinical indices in a sample of individuals with PCOS and a healthy control group. This platform (FemBio) will enable broader accessibility to the latest in molecular assays, multi- omic quantification, and computational modeling for the general public, which currently is lacking. In turn, this will improve options for PCOS characterization, long-term management, and open potentially new treatment options for the millions of women suffering from this disorder, as well as serve as a large, annotated multi-omic data set that can help the PCOS field more broadly.

"Hematopoietic Stem Cell And Cord Blood Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hematopoietic cell transplantation from unrelated donors, haploidentical related donors and cord blood units can cure life-threatening blood disorders; however, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse and survivorship disparities across different ancestries remain the major obstacles. When matched donors are not available, the properties of HLA mismatches that govern (non)-permissivity are not well-defined. Furthermore, the role of KIR/HLA interactions in modulating relapse remain to be clarified. These deficiencies have important implications for a large fraction of patients who lack HLA-matched donors, and for all patients at risk for disease relapse. We have demonstrated that HLA class I leader peptides, HLA-DP expression, and HLA/KIR interactions each contribute to GVHD, relapse and mortality. The unmet needs are to understand the mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes modulate transplant risks, and a means to apply the research findings to clinical care. We propose to define the underlying mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes and proteins function in transplantation, and develop tools for using HLA and KIR in the selection of the optimal transplant donor and cord blood unit. The specific aims are to: define the role of HLA-DP expression and peptide-binding groove pocket in GVHD; define NKG2/HLA-E interactions and HLA-G in GVHD and relapse; define the role for KIR and HLA interaction in relapse after HCT for acute leukemia, and design tools to evaluate gene features in clinical practice. The goals will be achieved through systemic analysis of individual gene variation, haplotypes of genes, and receptor/ligand recognition in large ethnically diverse transplant populations with complete clinical data. This proposal will fill the knowledge gap in the immunobiological basis of GVHD, relapse and survivorship disparities in transplantation. The information will increase the safety, efficacy and availability of transplantation for all patients in need of this life-saving therapy.

"Model-guided design of next-generation bacterial therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It is becoming increasingly evident that the composition and metabolites produced by the human gut microbiome influence the progression of cardiovascular diseases. While we are continuing to discover important associations between the gut microbiome and human physiology and diseases, we lack the tools and methodology to precisely manipulate gut microbiota to benefit human health. We propose to develop computational models and optimization frameworks to predict community dynamics and functions and design interventions to shift the gut microbiome to desired states. We will design novel bacterial therapeutics that operate autonomously in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract to steer the microbiome towards healthy states. These next-generation bacterial therapeutics will sense important gut microbiome metabolites, process information, and deliver species- specific antimicrobial proteins to reshape the dynamics and functions of this ecosystem. The performance of these bacterial therapeutics will be characterized in vitro using synthetic human gut microbiome communities and in gnotobiotic mouse models of cardiovascular disease. Model-guided microbiome engineering has the potential to transform human medicine and is becoming increasingly important as scientists continue to discover connections between the microbiome and human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies have shown close connections between the human gut microbiome and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the leading cause of death worldwide. While engineering of the gut microbiome holds tremendous potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for CVD, we currently lack the tools and methodology required to design interventions that precisely shift the structure and function of the gut microbiome.

"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines.

"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection. These insights will improve our ability to identify populations most at-risk for infection as well as allow us to tailor intervention and prevention efforts to more effectively combat seasonal influenza.",Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach,10008955,F32AI145177,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Avidity', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding', 'Birth', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neuraminidase', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive measure', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seasons', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface Antigens', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'age group', 'base', 'cohort', 'combat', 'design', 'immunogenicity', 'imprint', 'improved', 'individual response', 'infection risk', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'universal influenza vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2020,65310,-0.021902226401594664
"Omics for TB:  Response to Infection and Treatment Abstract – Overview With about 10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths annually, TB is a global health emergency. A distinguishing feature of TB disease is its biological heterogeneity, which manifests at the clinical level chiefly in 2 forms: disease progression and treatment response. The premise of this Program is that the heterogeneous outcomes of TB infection and treatment are determined by the interplay of competing regulatory networks between the pathogen and the host. Our primary goal is to apply systems biology approaches to elucidate the biological control underlying the variability of disease outcome and response to treatment. Our first specific aim is to define novel host regulators of TB disease progression in vivo, and the innate and adaptive networks they control. We will also seek to define novel Mtb regulators of TB treatment response, and the Mtb regulatory networks that they control. This work will allow us to produce and validate host and Mtb models of TB disease progression and treatment response. Altogether, this program addresses key unanswered questions that stymie efforts to combat the TB pandemic. Our team has perfected the required platforms and scientific approaches to execute this ambitious research plan in a timely and cost- effective manner. All the participating investigators have strong records of interacting productively, and of disseminating their data and reagents to the scientific community. Project Narrative - Omics for TB: Response to Infection and Treatment Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes ~10 million new cases of active disease and 1.8 million deaths each year, and our tools to combat tuberculosis (TB) disease are universally outdated and overmatched.

"Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage ABSTRACT Despite major eradication efforts over the past century, malaria remains a significant world-wide health burden. Plasmodium vivax poses the greatest obstacle to malaria eradication due to its ability to form dormant stages within the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites can reactivate weeks to years after the initial infection, leading to relapses, and can only be targeted by two licensed drugs with extensive side effects and toxicity that limits their use. Models of disease prevalence suggest that even a modest reduction of hypnozoite abundance in the liver could make a major impact on the spread of disease. All Plasmodium parasites that have been extensively studied have been shown to rely on specific host signaling events for invasion and development through liver stage infection. These host factors represent potential targets for host-based interventions. Unfortunately, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding the host factors that permit Plasmodium vivax liver stages to persist and develop, in large part because of technical challenges associated with growing the parasite and then monitoring host signaling events in rare infected cells. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by using two approaches, kinase regression and digital spatial profiling, to interrogate host-driven phosphosignaling in P. vivax-infected hepatocytes, including those that harbor hypnozoites. If successful, our approach will identify host kinases that are necessary for P. vivax developing and dormant liver stages, as well as phosphosignaling that is altered by infection. These data will dramatically enhance our understanding of host factors that regulate Plasmodium vivax liver infection, and in doing so provide insight into the cellular niche that promotes liver-stage parasite development and dormancy. In addition to enhancing the understanding of this largely mysterious process, this information could inform host-directed therapies, which represent a novel approach to targeting dormant malaria parasites. NARRATIVE Malaria kills approximately half of a million people annually. One of the major hurdles to malaria eradication is the ability of Plasmodium vivax to form hypnozoites, dormant liver stages that can remain within the host for years and lead to relapses. This proposal seeks to assess host factors that change upon, and are necessary for, P. vivax developing and dormant parasites, with the long-term goal of using this information to eliminate relapsing malaria.",Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage,10056490,R21AI151344,"['Antibodies', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Onset of illness', 'Parasites', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Plasmodium yoelii', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sporozoites', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vivax Malaria', 'base', 'differential expression', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'liver infection', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'side effect', 'small hairpin RNA', 'small molecule']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,281780,-0.008781149925777717
"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns.

"Accurate prediction of neutralization capacity from deep mining of SARS-CoV-2 serology ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to establish an accurate and sensitive method for predicting the neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 of serum samples by deep mining of antibody profiles. The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global threat with nearly seven million cases and 400K deaths. In the absence of effective vaccines and therapeutics, immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is a main mechanism of protection against SARS-CoV-2 (re)infection. Our recent studies of convalescent serum samples revealed that their levels of neutralization capacity vary greatly (over 100-fold) and only a small subset has high neutralization capacity. Because viral neutralization assays are inherently low throughput, it is unrealistic to apply it to a high-risk population such as hospital workers in a timely manner. Unfortunately, there is only moderate correlation between the neutralization capacity and the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels determined using standard ELISA. Clearly, we still do not understand what types of antibodies contribute to viral neutralization. Our overarching hypothesis to be tested in this project is that by examining the antibody profile in patient serum more deeply and quantitatively in terms of antigens, epitopes and antibody types, we will be able to identify quantitative predictive markers for viral neutralization. To this end, we will develop multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 serology that will enable us to deeply characterize the antibody profile. We will then develop a predictive algorithm by utilizing. We have assembled a team of experts with truly complementary skills in antibody characterization, virology and data mining. We have access to a large number of convalescent serum samples, which will enable us to critically validate our technology. We will expeditiously execute the following aims. (1) We will develop multiplex serology assay for SARS-CoV-2 that can profile up to 15 antibody-antigen interactions in a single reaction. The main technical innovation is the introduction of multi-dimensional flow cytometry. We will produce multiple antigens including Spike, receptor-binding domain and nucleocapsid protein, and their natural and designed variants. We will refine and validate the assay using a large panel of convalescent serum samples. (2) We will develop an improved viral neutralization assay to better quantify the neutralization capacity. (3) We will develop a predictive algorithm for neutralization capacity that utilizes the antibody profiles from our multiplex assay. This analysis will identify serology parameters that contribute to neutralization. The end products of this project will include a high-throughput serology assay that gives far- richer antibody profiles than the current standard accompanied with an accurate predictive algorithm. Together, this platform will help advance a fundamental understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the development of vaccines and therapeutics against this formidable pathogen. PROJECT NARRATIVE The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood samples of people exposed to the virus vary greatly, and current antibody testing methods do not accurately determine the level of neutralizing antibodies. This project will develop innovative platform for deep mining of antibody profiles from a small amount of blood samples and accurately predict their neutralization capacity.

"Investigation of arterial changes in the Circle of Willis during intracranial aneurysm growth in humans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prevalence of saccular intracranial aneurysms (IA) in western populations is estimated at around ~3%. Clinically, IA present a dilemma, in that they are usually asymptomatic; however, IA are extremely dangerous if they rupture, causing subarachnoid hemorrhage (~50% mortality). There is convincing evidence that continued IA growth increases the risk of rupture (12-24 times). To better monitor and predict IA progression, there is a compelling need to better understand clinical IA growth (aneurysmal remodeling). 90% of IA occur within the arteries of the Circle of Willis (CoW). Despite there being overwhelming evidence connecting CoW vascular remodeling and IA disease, the majority of IA research focuses only on the IA site, and does not consider the contribution of connected arteries. Specific vascular remodeling in the CoW arteries may provide an additional indicator for monitoring IA progression. The biochemical processes that occur at the IA site include inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling leading to cell death and vessel wall degeneration. Analyses in animal models have strongly connected arterial wall shear stress (WSS) as a trigger of these processes, leading to IA initiation and remodeling. Patient-oriented research has further linked areas of low WSS with IA growth. Because CoW vasculature can change during IA growth, the blood flow entering IA changes and may create a new level of WSS to stabilize the remodeling process. Better understanding how human IA may naturally stabilize is highly relevant to predicting IA progression, and the role of changing WSS will be investigated in this grant. In our recent study of 520 clinically monitored IA, we found that while many IA grew consistently, following a projected growth path, others became stable. We also found that IA growth speed is significantly faster in women. Given the association of IA with sex, family history, and disease, different patterns of vascular remodeling may occur within groups with different genetics or medical history. We propose a clinical translational study to study IA growth in different genetic and medical history groups. We hypothesize IA growth may associate with patterns of vascular remodeling within the CoW. We will test our hypothesis with the following specific aims: (1) Is IA growth a local phenomenon or it associated with vascular remodeling within the CoW? (2) Do genetically similar individuals undergo similar patterns of vascular remodeling? (3) Does blood flow within the CoW associate with vascular remodeling? By identifying how IA disease progression may associate with other remodeling within the CoW, this study can identify new imaging biomarkers that enable improved IA treatment decisions. This proposal is significant because there is an unmet need to accurately assess IA disease progression and changes in risk. This proposal is innovative because it will extend existing IA studies to include more, relevant cerebrovascular arteries and longitudinal data, while implementing several technical innovations specific to this problem which can translate to clinical tracking of cerebrovascular changes PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms are extremely dangerous when they rupture. When one is detected, it may be treated or monitored through imaging, with aneurysm growth a strong indication of increased risk of rupture. This project will study how remodeling in the arteries of the Circle of Willis associates with aneurysm growth, and how blood flow may determine locations of remodeling, in order to identify new biomarkers to improve tracking and assessment of aneurysm progression.",Investigation of arterial changes in the Circle of Willis during intracranial aneurysm growth in humans,9947821,R01HL152270,"['Affect', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Caliber', 'Cell Death', 'Characteristics', 'Circle of Willis', 'Clinical', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Woman', 'Work', 'arterial tortuosity', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical risk', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'sex', 'shape analysis', 'shear stress', 'side effect', 'tool', 'translational study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,693928,0.007865923568221906
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us.

"Biomarking IBD patient-specific disease features using the epithelial antigenic peptidome Project Summary/Abstract  In immune-mediated diseases such as type1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets. However, with the focus on genetics, inflammatory effectors, and microbiome, there has not been a modern search for such antibody biomarkers and the potential contribution of anti-epithelial autoimmunity in IBD. This project tests the hypothesis that ulcerative colitis phenotypes are distinguished by autoantibodies to mucosal epithelial proteins, addressed in two aims.  In the first aim, we apply the innovative peptide expression display (PED) technology to display and analyze the antigenic epithelial peptidome. This includes bioinformatically determining a comprehensive tabulation of human proteins with high likelihood for antigenicity and ileal-colonic epithelial expression; and, representing these proteins as tiled peptide epitopes with linked cognate oligonucleotides suitable for NGS-based identification and quantitation.  In the second aim, we will assess archival sera of 654 well-characterized colonic IBD patients and non-IBD controls to quantitate individual profiles of epithelial protein binding in relation to two outcomes of ulcerative colitis (UC). The significance of the project has been endorsed by the IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC), which made the UC colectomy cohort a research priority, and will collaborate with this R21 via archival serum samples and associated genetics and clinical metadata from the consortium UC patients and controls. Our primary study will compare 300 UC subjects, equally divided into severe and mild phenotypes of outcome based on time to colectomy. Our secondary study will compare 154 UC post-colectomy pouch patients, divided into severe and absent pouchitis phenotypes. We will also study two age-matched reference populations. Bioinformatic analyses will test for shared peptide specificities associated with disease state (UC vs. non-IBD controls) and each of the two extreme phenotypes (severe vs. mild UC; chronic pouchitis vs. late non-pouchitis). We also will perform exploratory tests for the role of IBD predictive risk scores and select genetic loci on autoantibody specificities.  If successful, this project will establish feasibility for the hypothesis, and foundational targets to pursue mechanistic and clinical biomarker studies that may validate and refine its implications for IBD pathogenesis and clinical applications. Project narrative In immune-mediated diseases such as type-1 diabetes, target-cell autoantibodies have emerged as important clinical biomarkers of pre-clinical disease progression and mechanistic disease subsets. Here we propose the first modern search for autoantibody biomarkers in ulcerative colitis, and a test of the hypothesis that anti-epithelial autoimmunity is a contributor to extreme phenotypes in this disease.

"Pro-inflammatory activation of human macrophages regulated by lncRNAs Project Summary Macrophage activation promotes major inflammatory disorders, including arterial diseases. Its underlying mechanisms, however, remain obscure. The present study will establish a systems approach, involving computational prediction analyses, multi-omics, network science, and in vitro and in vivo validation, to discover long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated mechanisms for pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and arterial disease. In Specific Aim 1, we will involve omics studies of human macrophages to identify lncRNAs and their interacting proteins and develop computational analyses to predict human lncRNAs that regulate macrophage activation. Specific Aim 2 will examine the functionality of candidate lncRNAs in macrophage activation in vitro and in vivo. The findings from the study will help to identify new mechanisms for macrophage activation and may provide molecular bases for new therapies. Project Narrative Inflammation plays a key role in coronary artery disease and other major vascular diseases, global health threats. Even with potent risk modifiers, e.g., statins, many patients still suffer vascular events. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate various biological processes.

"A Multipronged Interrogation of Large-Scale Omics Data to Reveal COVID-19 Pathways The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to more than 470,000 deaths. This disease is especially perilous for the elderly - 80% of deaths in the US have been individuals over the age of 65, and the social isolation created by lockdowns have increased risks of serious physical and mental health issues.  COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease exhibiting a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild (e.g. loss of smell, dry cough) to critical (e.g. cytokine storm, renal failure, cardiovascular damage, respiratory failure, lethal blood clotting, neurological disorders). This clinical heterogeneity demands a precision medicine approach that elucidates distinct pathways underlying the disease, develops treatments for each pathway, and defines biomarker patterns to diagnose patients for classification within the subsets. A key benefit of precision medicine is that drugs may be repurposed or may already exist to treat specific subsets of infected individuals. For example, one critical outcome for COVID-19 infection is the onset of a cytokine storm, in which the body's immune system gets caught in a positive feedback loop, leading to shock and rapid failure of multiple organs. There are existing drugs for treating cytokine storm syndrome, but practitioners have no clear guidelines if such treatments are beneficial or destructive. If the individual is not in a hyperinflammatory state, the administration of these drugs could cripple their immune response, leading to increased viral load. Plasma biomarker patterns of proteins and metabolites hold potential to identify impending cytokine storms and other lethal outcomes.  To advance precision medicine for COVID-19 treatment, this work will generate large-scale omics data and evaluate levels of proteins and metabolites for plasma drawn from 350 COVID-19 positive cases and 750 normal controls. These data will be immediately released to the research community. Our research team will take a concerted multipronged approach for analyzing these data using diverse complementary techniques. Our labs' research focuses on the discovery of combinations of genes and proteins expressing synchronously and the associations of these combinations with traits of interest, as well as endophenotype discovery. In addition to thorough single analyte analyses, this research will employ three computational strategies to reveal combinations of factors defining patterns: 1) network modeling, 2) explainable-AI systems biology, and 3) linear programming. These intensive analyses will require significant computational resources and we will utilize Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, for these tasks.  The comprehensive protein and metabolite profiles, based on a large cohort of COVID-19 cases and normal controls, along with our rigorous interrogation of these data for complex biomarker patterns indicative of patient outcomes, hold unprecedented potential to drive solid advances in precision medicine and to reduce mortality rates due to COVID-19. In addition, this research will provide an agile model for use when tackling other heterogeneous diseases plaguing humankind, as well as novel viruses that may arise in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic is exceptionally detrimental for the elderly, as they comprise 80% of deaths in the US and are at elevated risks for serious physical and mental health issues due to social isolation. COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease that exhibits a range of diverse symptoms, demanding a precision medicine approach in which treatments for each distinct outcome are developed, biomarker patterns to diagnose patients for classification into an outcome group are defined, and new candidate drug targets are generated for each outcome. In order to lay the foundation for a precision medicine approach for treating COVID-19, this work will generate a highly-phenotyped large-scale omics dataset including blood proteomics and metabolomics from 350 COVID-19 positive cases and 750 uninfected healthy individuals and will intensely analyze these data using diverse complementary high-performance computing techniques, including network modeling with enhanced accuracy, explainable-AI systems biology incorporating diverse data, and pioneering linear programming producing optimal associations, thereby illuminating complex proteomic and metabolomic biomarker patterns associated with each critical disease outcome and generating novel candidate drug targets.",A Multipronged Interrogation of Large-Scale Omics Data to Reveal COVID-19 Pathways,10202278,RF1AG053303,"['2019-nCoV', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood coagulation', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ebola', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Programming', 'Mental Health', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Mutate', 'Natural Selections', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Shock', 'Smell Perception', 'Social isolation', 'Solid', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'complex data ', 'computing resources', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'diverse data', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'fighting', 'human old age (65+)', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'physical conditioning', 'precision drugs', 'precision medicine', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor', 'response', 'statistics', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'trait', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,650002,-0.013795584534420384
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders. The implementation of an evolutionary, system-level model improves our understanding of modern human disease, and, validates existing and novel dietary interventions to lessen their incidence in industrialized societies.",Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease,9892997,R01DK112381,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Agriculture', 'Americas', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Civilization', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucose Metabolism Disorders', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Jamaica', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Triglycerides', 'Trinidad', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fecal metabolome', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'human disease', 'improved', 'lipid metabolism', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'nutrition related genetics', 'theories', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIDDK,"J.

"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),10019521,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Caudovirales', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'DNA Viruses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Enteral', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Genome', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Norovirus', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'bacterial resistance', 'bacteriome', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'early childhood', 'experimental analysis', 'genome annotation', 'gut microbiome', 'human virome', 'improved', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'molecular sequence database', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'protein function', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tool', 'virology', 'virome']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2020,1832307,0.0025116794352951547
"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes. Findings are also validated in samples from humans.",Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures,9849329,R01HL145411,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Bacillus', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Granuloma', 'Harvest', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Malaria', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vehicle crash', 'base', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NHLBI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R01,2020,655091,-0.03006782714919524
"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease. The assay can be completed in less than 25 min allowing for rapid in office results to support clinical diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is critical to prevent disease progression and sequelae; however current laboratory diagnostics that are used to support clinical diagnosis are insensitive during early infection, failing ~50% of the time. We propose the development of a sensitive and specific multi-antigen point-of-care assay that will provide immediate serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to aid in physician diagnosis. Accurate, rapid diagnosis will improve patient outcomes by reducing the likelihood of developing potentially debilitating late stage disease through early antibiotic intervention.",A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease,10080510,R44AI150060,"['Address', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Borrelia miyamotoi', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Coupled', 'DBL Oncoprotein', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'ITGB3 gene', 'ImProv', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Diagnosis', 'Legal patent', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'OspC protein', 'Paper', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cross reactivity', 'decorin binding protein B', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'multiplex detection', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'portability', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'relapsing fever borrelia', 'screening']",NIAID,"BIOPEPTIDES, INC.",R44,2020,300000,0.002518316010634069
"Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Prashant K. Purohit, John L. Bassani, Valeri Barsegov and John W. Weisel The goal of this proposal is to explore and understand the fracture toughness of blood clots and thrombi, thus providing a mechanistic basis for life-threatening thrombotic embolization. A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering. Project Narrative The research objective of this proposal is to measure, model and predict the mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi at the molecular and continuum length scales.

"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches Aortic valve stenosis is the major cause of valve disease in the Western world, and the third leading cause of adult heart disease. It is a progressive disorder that worsens with age. Thickening of the aortic valve is followed by calcification that results in further stenosis that ultimately necessitates surgical replacement. A major risk factor for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which is present in 1–2% of the population, and involves formation of a two- rather than three-valve leaflet. ~35% of individuals with BAV will develop CAVD with age, but some with BAV have thickening even in childhood, requiring intervention. There are no medical treatments available for CAVD patients, and the only clinical option is surgical valve replacement. We reported that heterozygous nonsense mutations in the NOTCH1 (N1) transcription factor cause congenital biscuspid aortic valve (BAV) and severe CAVD and evidence suggests N1 is haploinsufficient in valve endothelial cells (ECs). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs from several patients with CAVD and N1 haploinsufficiency showed increased expression of pro-osteogenic and inflammatory signaling. Network analysis revealed key nodes that were responsible for much of the gene dysregulation. A chemical screen for the ability to restore expression of 120 dysregulated genes by targeted RNA-sequencing revealed several drugs that restored the network close to the N1+/+ state in human iPSC-ECs, with one, XCT790, showing efficacy in vivo for aortic valve thickening, calcification and stenosis in a mouse model. XCT790 is annotated to function as an inhibitor of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα). We now propose to test the hypotheses that XCT790 prevents aortic valve disease by inhibiting ERRα activity, can treat established disease, and can function in a subset of CAVD patient cells without N1 mutations. The aims are 1) to determine the mechanism of action by which XCT790 corrects disease-associated gene expression and prevents aortic valve disease; 2) to determine if XCT790 can treat established CAVD or prevent neonatal valve stenosis; and 3) to determine if gene dysregulation in primary aortic valve endothelial cells from sporadic CAVD patients with or without genetic variants in NOTCH1 pathway genes is responsive to XCT790. These studies will advance a potential therapeutic to treat a disease that represents an enormous unmet medical need, is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, and for which the only current remedy is a highly invasive surgery. Aortic valve disease is the third most common form of heart disease and one of the most difficult to treat pediatric diseases. In adults, calcification and thickening lead to need for surgical replacement, with no medical therapy available. In this proposal we test the mechanism by which a novel small molecule therapeutic prevents aortic valve calcification in mice, test the clinical scenarios in which it may be efficacious and determine the range of patients who may benefit from this therapy by examining the response of cells derived from individuals with valve disease.",Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches,9867301,R01HL150100,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'ERR1 protein', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NOTCH1 gene', 'Neonatal', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Valve Stenosis', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Surgical Valves', 'Telomerase RNA Component', 'Telomere Shortening', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Western World', 'aging population', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve disorder', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'calcification', 'cell type', 'drug testing', 'endothelial stem cell ', 'exome sequencing', 'gene correction', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'malformation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'osteogenic', 'prevent', 'response', 'shear stress', 'small molecule libraries', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'telomere', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,J.

"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,9998187,R01HL152735,"['African American', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Race', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Transcript', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'base', 'chronic airflow obstruction', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'protein metabolite', 'single molecule', 'soluble RAGE', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,824479,-0.0040910659495996355
"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test. If successful, the results will the first step needed to make progress toward addressing the critical unmet need for non-sputum biomarker-based tests for childhood TB.",Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings,9986338,R01AI152161,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gambia', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Tryptophan', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'field study', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'ion mobility', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptomics', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,1503586,-0.03815803232930619
"The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery SUMMARY - OVERALL In personalized medicine, the care of each patient is guided by his/her unique clinical circumstances. At its foundation, however, this paradigm holds a concurrent need for personalized science, in which technologies are developed and hypothesis explored in light of individual diversity. Critically, this diversity also includes unique microbial populations, which can augment the onset, progression, and treatment of disease. Within the field of benign urology, one of the most common pathologies—urinary tract infections (UTIs)—is also one of the most heterogenous, as the risk factors, symptomatology, and outcomes can vary significantly from patient to patient. Not surprisingly, the complexity of UTIs extends beyond the host, with tremendous genotypic and phenotypic diversity among the species/strains of microbes that elicit these infections. To better align the management of UTIs with the goals of precision care, our understanding of pathophysiology must become more nuanced, as we network in tandem the inherent diversity of host and microbe. To these ends, we propose a resource that provides an interconnected picture of both components, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository (VUIR). With our institution's unique foundation in medical informatics, we will create a searchable database of clinical parameters from bacteriuric patients (many thousands of cases annually), together with microbiologic data on the organisms. In parallel, the paired microbial strains will be stored permanently as a biobank for analysis and experimentation, together with linkage to anonymized versions of patient records within Vanderbilt's Synthetic Derivative (a filtered version of our electronic health data). The logistical infrastructure for clinical biobanking is also already in place at Vanderbilt via the institutionally-supported microVU initiative, in which microbial isolates from the diagnostic laboratory are repurposed as academic resources. As a basic expansion of these efforts, the VUIR will represent a first-in-kind tool for developing technologies to combat UTIs, while also investigating their underlying pathogenesis. In particular, it could facilitate functional genomic studies that bridge host and pathogen. Demonstrating the resource's value, we will conduct whole-genome sequencing of clinically underrepresented bacterial species, together with genome-wide association studies that focus on the infection phenotypes of the source-patients. In addition to novel virulence factors, we seek to identify elusive genomic determinants that distinguish cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and symptomatic UTI. The molecular basis of UTI-versus-ASB epitomizes a clinical challenge that requires integration of host and pathogen, as provided by the VUIR. Finally, to support the program and its discoveries, we propose an organizational structure of multidisciplinary content-area experts and dedicated support staff. Along with coordinating daily activities and assuring seamless dissemination of data/specimens, this Administrative Core (AdCore) will champion educational activities and additional pilot projects that build upon the resource. In sum, the VUIR stands to generate actionable discoveries from the human and microbial diversity of UTIs—not in spite of it. PROJECT NARRATIVE - OVERALL Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not only a common urologic ailment, but one of the most widespread medical conditions facing women, men and children around the globe. In order for clinicians to better manage UTIs—and scientists to understand them more deeply—our clinical viewpoint must become personalized, as we study in tandem the afflicted patients and offending pathogens. To these ends, the Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository will provide a first-in-kind resource for the biomedical community, creating a massive network of patient-level clinical data and banked microbial strains from patients with real-world infections.","The Vanderbilt Urologic Infection Repository, a Resource for Personalized Clinical Discovery",10022297,P20DK123967,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Advisory Committees', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacteriuria', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Published Comment', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urology', 'Uropathogen', 'Virulence Factors', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical resource', 'career development', 'clinical database', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical sequencing', 'combat', 'data dissemination', 'data mining', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'men', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'patient health information', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'urologic', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P20,2020,340000,-0.010697721335828046
"Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue Project Summary / Abstract  Central nervous system infections with RNA viruses cause severe neurological deficits and death, and are extremely challenging to diagnose. This multiple PI proposal presents an innovative research program that will provide the foundation for a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline to rapidly diagnose RNA virus infections from surgical brain biopsies. The investigators will combine two cutting-edge techniques for viral detection, screening with double-stranded RNA immunohistochemistry (dsRNA IHC) to identify cases with a high likelihood of a viral etiology, and unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for specific virus identification and genome analysis.  To develop the dsRNA IHC screening assay, six commercially available anti-dsRNA antibodies will be optimized in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue and evaluated in a series of known infectious and non-infectious cases. The top candidates will be tested in a set of brain biopsies with inflammation of unclear etiology and compared to results of mNGS performed in parallel. The development of this assay will facilitate efficient screening of FFPE tissue samples from patients with neurological disease of unclear pathogenesis to identify those with a high likelihood of viral etiology. To improve mNGS methods for FFPE brain tissue, new laboratory techniques will be tested to increase the yield and quality of viral RNA extracted. In addition to virus identification, mNGS will be used to perform full-genome deep sequencing of viruses. These results can be applied to molecular epidemiology, disease surveillance, and understanding pathogen-host interactions. Overall, this project will enhance our understanding of RNA viruses that cause CNS infection, inform future studies of virus evolution and pathogenesis, and lay the foundation for the development of a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline that will substantially improve the care of patients with devastating CNS infections. This work aligns very well with the NINDS mission to seek and apply fundamental knowledge of the brain to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  This R21 Exploratory Neuroscience Research Grant proposal will support and expand the collaboration between the two PIs. The unique combination of expertise in neuropathology, infectious disease pathology, virology, clinical infectious disease, and metagenomic sequencing demonstrate the requisite skills and perspective needed to achieve the goals of this proposal. The stimulating environments of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard University, and Emory University are extremely well suited to the proposed research plan, which not only provide critical equipment and facilities infrastructure, but also mentorship, formal opportunities to present and discuss results, and eventual venues to implement this clinical testing prospectively. Project Narrative Viral infections of the central nervous system cause significant illness and death, and in many patients the specific virus causing infection is never found. This project will develop new tools to detect viruses in brain tissue, including previously unknown viruses, and sequence their genomes. The objectives of this project are to improve diagnostics for patients with devastating neurological illness, and to open new research directions in studying viruses that cause central nervous system infection.",Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue,10105533,R21NS119660,"['Adenoviruses', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Arboviruses', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Central Nervous System Viral Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cytoplasmic Inclusion', 'DNA Viruses', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'Encephalitis', 'Enterovirus', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Target', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Nodule', 'Nuclear Inclusion', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Virus Infections', 'RNA Viruses', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Specimen', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'deep sequencing', 'fungus', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'prospective test', 'rRNA Genes', 'rapid diagnosis', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'viral RNA', 'viral detection', 'viral genomics', 'virology', 'virus identification', 'whole genome']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,480375,-0.017861167195506823
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9922844,U01AI124275,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial drug', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal bacteria', 'commensal microbes', 'computational platform', 'computer studies', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,1755886,0.011348567585262335
"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,9926246,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'kidney biopsy', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2020,169560,0.012619708838207634
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,9989920,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired healing', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Infection', 'Wound models', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic ulcer', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial genomics', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'tissue-repair responses', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,511458,-0.016000550412757348
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9989043,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,677759,0.008740429311270783
