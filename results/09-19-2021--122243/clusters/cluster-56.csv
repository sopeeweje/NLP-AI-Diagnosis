"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies. We propose to integrate computational modeling with functional genomics techniques to refine the immunotherapy response biomarkers, identify novel regulators of immunotherapy response, and elucidate their underlying mechanisms, with the potential to improve immunotherapy response.",Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response,9818071,R01CA234018,"['4T1', 'ATAC-seq', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'CT26', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cell-Mediated Cytolysis', 'Cells', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Exclusion', 'Expression Profiling', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Interferon Type II', 'Knock-out', 'Libraries', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Regulator Genes', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Statistical Models', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'anti-CTLA4', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'genomic profiles', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune checkpoint blockers', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'web server']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2019,497881,0.0562051552175295
"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9788340,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'actionable mutation', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2019,228089,0.05851521286372501
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation. The research will establish  resources and software to contribute such methodologies for the Genome Data Analysis Network  projects that will subsequently be released into the public domain to benefit the entire scientific  community.",UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,9763504,U24CA210990,"['Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North Carolina', 'Oncogenic', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Subtype', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'data pipeline', 'exceptional responders', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2019,368332,0.0842761609876551
"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,9624746,R01CA218357,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Incineration', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Kansas', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung preservation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'minimal risk', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pre-clinical', 'real time monitoring', 'safety and feasibility', 'simulation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor ablation', 'virtual']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,295727,0.03522567510527224
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. The functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist.",High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors,9647173,K22CA234406,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR screen', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Faculty', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guide RNA', 'Heterogeneity', 'K22 Award', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer cell line', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug development', 'druggable target', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'homologous recombination', 'individual patient', 'irinotecan', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'mouse model', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oxaliplatin', 'precision oncology', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'targeted agent', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K22,2019,192240,0.05735692226996097
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,9743114,K99CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K99,2019,134632,0.09239533682876697
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9747360,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'efficacy testing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'preclinical efficacy', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,531751,0.08204382703998418
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9621372,K00CA212457,"['Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'inter-individual variation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2019,83070,0.04745947494719308
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,9663912,U54CA225088,"['Achievement', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAF gene', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Newsletter', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'acquired drug resistance', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical research site', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'effector T cell', 'imaging modality', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2019,2067796,0.030327242220404373
"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,9703925,R37CA232209,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Screening', 'E-Cadherin', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Experimental Models', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-in', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Premalignant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vimentin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic signature', 'genomic profiles', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'paracrine', 'prevent', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2019,431871,-0.016131630704968803
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics.

"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. The influence of daily rhythms on cancer biology and treatment is particularly strong.

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9759874,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2019,399937,0.065988661767722
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The integration of a machine-learning algorithm will further provide precise and unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor ecosystem.",Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems,9756346,U01CA214411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomimetics', 'Biopsy', 'Bioreactors', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cetuximab', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glucose', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidics', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Rest', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Derived', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'cytokine', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fluid flow', 'genetic profiling', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'protein B', 'response', 'side effect', 'survival outcome', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2019,775492,0.06801339893205323
"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy,9713119,R01CA237210,"['Antibodies', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granzyme', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Inflammatory', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Peptidyltransferase', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Recombinants', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Protease', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'humanized mouse', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'oncology', 'perforin', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'pharmacodynamic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'resistance mechanism', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sortase', 'success', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,341598,0.020499318156939946
"Single-cell characterization of tumor and microenvironment co-evolution in Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas Project Summary Tumor and microenvironment constitute complex ecologies involving a multitude of stromal cells, immune cells, and in some cases coexisting microbes. A paradigmatic example of complex tumor-microenvironment interactions are peripheral T-cell lymphomas, aggressive and genetically complex tumors where tumor cells often constitute a minority cell population. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas are frequently associated with the presence of Epstein-Barr virus whose role in the disease remains largely uncharacterized. We have shown that the presence of specific macrophage populations and viral transcriptional programs are associated to survival. But, how do tumor and microenvironment coevolve and inform prognosis? Our project goal is to characterize the tumor- microenvironment interactions and coevolution in peripheral T-cell lymphomas using large collections of human transcriptomic data and longitudinal single-cell sequencing data from recently developed mouse models. We will develop an approach based on random matrix theory and topological data analysis for modelling the continuous aspect of tumor microenvironment evolution. We will further deploy our lab-developed methodology for in silico pathogen detection to study the interactions between the Epstein-Barr virus and peripheral T-cell lymphoma lymphomagenesis and progression. Successful completion of our goals will provide a general, experimentally validated strategy to uncover the dynamical nature of tumor-microenvironment interactions at the single-cell resolution in tumor types with complex stromal component. Additionally, our approach will help uncover new microenvironment driven targets supporting lymphoma cell growth, with potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of this deadly disease. Narrative Tumor and microenvironment coexist and coevolve determining clinical outcomes.

"The Mechanism of SOX6 in Ewing Sarcoma Metastasis Project Summary Current survival rates of pediatric cancers like leukemia have seen drastic positive response in survival and treatment in the last 20 years. In stark contrast, patients with solid tumor metastasis challenge the current paradigm of intense chemotherapy treatment. Such treatments have failed to change the poor prognosis of metastatic disease indicating a need to understand the complex underpinnings of the in vivo metastatic microenvironment. This need for understanding is enhanced in pediatric patients, where metastasis is promoted by access to a large pool of undifferentiated cells. This project addresses this critical issue in Ewing sarcoma, a cancer that codifies the challenges and shortcomings of current cancer therapeutics. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant cancer of bone and soft tissue targeting children, adolescents and young adults. Overall survival rates for Ewing sarcoma patients with metastasis is abysmal at less than 20% for those with advanced disease and at 60% for those with localized tumors. One in three patients with Ewing sarcoma will have presentation of metastasis. These metrics demonstrate the desperate need to further understand the genesis of metastasis in vivo. This proposal focuses in on the role of the transcription factor SOX6 and its role in Ewing sarcoma metastasis. My preliminary zebrafish xenograft data show a clear, marked increase in metastasis with normal levels of SOX6, while SOX6 shRNA knockdown cells have less or no metastatic spread from injection site. My SOX6 knockdown proteome data show suppression of CAV1, a known gene targeting E-cadherin expression in Ewing sarcoma and increase of BCL2A1, an established anti-apoptotic protein involved in numerous cancer cells. This project’s central hypothesis is: 1) SOX6 mediated protein changes cause an increase in motility and decrease in apoptosis leading to metastasis and 2) that upon metastasis, interaction with the microenvironmental niche triggers invasive proliferative phenotypes mediated by downstream targets of SOX6. These SOX6-mdediated phenotype and proteomic changes support a story of in vivo initiation and persistence of metastatic lesions in Ewing sarcoma. This proposal is the first to look at the intersection of the cell microenvironment with SOX6 to show a new pathway for advancing momentum to targeted treatment of metastasis. Using my unique background in engineering and my training in cell biology, I propose a method that remediates key failures of current treatment by understanding the initiation of metastasis in vivo, persistence of cancer cells, and microenvironmental effects fostering metastasis. This proposal unites many disciplines to offer scientific impact on the genesis of metastasis and provides an incredible opportunity to train my skills as a future independent investigator. Project Narrative: Many metastatic models of cancer fail to account for the complexity of the tumor microenvironment at the metastatic niche, and the zebrafish provides a readily imageable model to analyze human cancer metastasis using machine learning. This project looks at the in vivo role of the transcription factor SOX6 in metastatic progression of Ewing sarcoma through cell proliferation, motility change, and apoptosis suppression. Further understanding and characterization of SOX6 will provide a new pathway for understanding metastatic progression, commonly associated with poor prognosis, in human Ewing sarcoma patients.",The Mechanism of SOX6 in Ewing Sarcoma Metastasis,9833891,F31CA236410,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biosensor', 'Bone Tissue', 'CAV1 gene', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Child', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collagen', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-Cadherin', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Failure', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Injections', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Bone Neoplasm', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'SOX6 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Zebrafish', 'advanced disease', 'cancer cell', 'cell motility', 'chemotherapy', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'leukemia', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'response', 'skills', 'small hairpin RNA', 'soft tissue', 'targeted imaging', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2019,33510,0.01988665265552653
"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9840425,R01CA234557,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow', 'COL1A2 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cancer Patient', 'Castration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Indolent', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'androgen sensitive', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'cell stroma', 'clinically significant', 'conditioning', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome editing', 'host neoplasm interaction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intercellular communication', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'molecular oncology', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'oncology', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer metastasis', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'response', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,496626,0.05737291103069617
"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments.

"Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients The EGFR-MAPK pathway is a key signaling pathway in human Triple Negative Beast Cancers (TNBC). We propose to leverage genomic and proteomic data from a rich animal model system, and 2 human clinical trials, to build predictive models of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway activity for TNBC patients. The heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered previous development of predictive pathway-based computational models because most approaches are based on experimental data from a single cell line or animal model that is then extrapolated to fit multiple tumor subtypes. Our approach is to use a diverse experimental model system that reflects the heterogeneous disease subtypes, and then use two distinct and complementary methods to build the computational model. We will simultaneously use mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches, at a variety of scales, that incorporate data from drug treated tumors and cell lines, assayed for gene expression, DNA copy number, DNA mutations, and protein kinome activity. Lastly, we will test these computational models on human tumors to evaluate their predictive performance. Project Narrative Breast cancer is not one disease, but instead, represents multiple diseases. Each of these unique subtypes requires a different therapeutic approach, thus, determining which new drugs will benefit each disease subtype is critical. To address this need, we are focusing on one of the most therapeutically difficult to treat breast cancer subtypes, namely Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC). We also propose to develop a mathematical representation of a key growth regulating pathway (i.e. EGFR-MAPK) that will predict its activity in TNBC patients, and thus could be used to guide therapies to those patients who have this pathway active within their tumors. We will ultimately test our predictive model on human tumors coming from clinical trials, and if successful, we will have developed a new biomarker for guiding TNBC patient treatments through the use of objective mathematical models",Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,9729382,U01CA238475,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'Erlotinib', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Inbred BALB C Mice', 'Individual', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'MAPK Signaling Pathway Pathway', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Normal Cell', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell growth', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'exome sequencing', 'feeding', 'human disease', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning network', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neoplastic cell', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'treatment strategy', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2019,572275,-0.03597567306082511
"Multiscale Resolution and Deep Network Approaches for Deconvolving Different Cell Types in Bulk Tumor using Single-cell Sequencing Data (scDEC) Abstract: Tumors are complex ecosystems composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Understanding the clonal cellular composition of the tumor and the non-malignant cells within the tumor ecosystem provides significant insights in the tumor recurrence, treatment, initiation, progression and metastasis. Previous studies estimated immune cell type content in bulk tumor expression data using immune cell signatures generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, with the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing methods, we can now also estimate the tumor associated non-malignant and malignant cell type contents.  In this proposal, we describe a novel deep net approach for deconvolving different cell types in bulk tumor using single-cell sequencing data (scDEC). We will also infer tumor associated copy number variation (CNV) clones and their signatures from single-cell RNA sequencing data using our novel multiscale resolution signal processing based algorithm. Our approach will estimate not only the content of different immune cell types and tumor associated non-malignant cell types but also the content of different CNV clone types in bulk tumor. Moreover, we will discover new associations between cell type content and sample phenotype such as disease survival, subtype and outcome. Our proposed project will lead to major improvements in clinical care to guide the treatment and prognosis of various types of cancer.

"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9743120,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2019,692707,0.027604794356093233
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,9614864,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,394948,0.03319223677333614
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9433637,K00CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2018,73814,0.04745947494719308
"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9646469,K08CA234458,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'actionable mutation', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2018,68267,0.05851521286372501
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. We propose to develop a new computational approach to use genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in primary tumors to understand the regulatory landscape of these subpopulations. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Results from this work will improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms of B cell lymphoma development and relapse.",Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations,9521585,R21LM012395,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'Biological', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expression Profiling', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mixed Cellular Population', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Normal Cell', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,193265,0.060074347059398306
"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,9470702,R01CA218357,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Incineration', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Kansas', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung preservation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'minimal risk', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pre-clinical', 'real time monitoring', 'safety and feasibility', 'simulation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor ablation', 'virtual']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,321353,0.03522567510527224
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9547124,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,552250,0.08900392315565393
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,9582884,K99CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K99,2018,134632,0.09239533682876697
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9525436,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'efficacy testing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'preclinical efficacy', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2018,541146,0.08204382703998418
"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9571234,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,550445,0.065988661767722
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,9475020,U54CA225088,"['Achievement', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAF gene', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Newsletter', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'acquired drug resistance', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical research site', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2018,2147606,0.030327242220404373
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9487202,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'early screening', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2018,347700,0.051688788960971316
"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,9605321,R37CA232209,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Screening', 'E-Cadherin', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Experimental Models', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-in', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Premalignant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vimentin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic signature', 'genomic profiles', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'paracrine', 'prevent', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2018,445227,-0.016131630704968803
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9577958,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2018,737882,0.027604794356093233
"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments.

"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism.

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"Exploring the Role of Mitochondrial Fission in Pancreatic Tumorigenesis Project Summary A wealth of data over the past few years, from our lab and others, has demonstrated that the mitochondrial morphology of tumor cells is distinct from normal cells. Furthermore, a number of studies have shown that genetic or pharmacological manipulation of the machinery that regulates mitochondrial morphology can impact a variety of tumorigenic processes. Indeed, in work performed for the parent grant of this proposal, we have shown that genetic inhibition of the mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1 can block pancreatic tumor growth and increase survival in a genetically engineered mouse model. This work has led to the deeper question of how changes in mitochondrial shape, which ultimately result from a combination of both genetic and environmental influences, contribute to the physiological processes that drive tumor growth. This question has been difficult to ask using traditional genetic and pharmacological approaches due to the complexity of the signaling pathways that converge on the mitochondria and the inherent heterogeneity present within the tumor and its surrounding stroma. To that end, we have developed a new software package designed to catalogue the morphological features of mitochondria within cells in culture or in fixed tissue. By using this software to analyze the tumor cells developed in our mouse models of pancreatic cancer, we propose to determine the relationship between specific mitochondrial features and key physiological attributes of these tumors. To do this, we have developed a machine learning technique, validated against a panel of tumor derived pancreatic cell lines with genetically-induced mitochondrial heterogeneity, capable of identifying relationships between mitochondrial features, or combinations of mitochondrial features, and other attributes of those cells. This approach will allow us to leverage the wealth of phenotypic data we have collected from our tumors with the data we are now able to collect on the mitochondrial heterogeneity, either between or within those tumors, in order to identify the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in tumor growth, regardless of whether that heterogeneity arises from manipulation of the mitochondrial dynamics machinery or whether it arises from the myriad influences within the tumor environment. Successful completion of these aims will provide critical insights into the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in pancreatic tumor growth and also pave the way for future analysis of mitochondrial heterogeneity in other tumor types. Project Narrative Our work exploring the role of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission in pancreatic tumor growth, using two relevant mouse models, has revealed that genetic inhibition of Drp1 can inhibit tumor growth and extend survival. In addition, these models provide a wealth of data to more deeply explore the relationship between mitochondrial heterogeneity and tumor physiology. We have developed robust computational methodology with which to explore this relationship. This exciting novel approach will provide critical insight into pancreatic tumorigenesis and potentially uncover novel therapeutic approaches.",Exploring the Role of Mitochondrial Fission in Pancreatic Tumorigenesis,9384887,R01CA200755,"['Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Models', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease Progression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Normal Cell', 'Oncogenic', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pancreatic cell line', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'pancreatic tumorigenesis', 'parent grant', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenic', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,191853,0.048915383424091685
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9349466,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,542768,0.08900392315565393
"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. We propose to develop a new computational approach to use genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in primary tumors to understand the regulatory landscape of these subpopulations. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Results from this work will improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms of B cell lymphoma development and relapse.",Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations,9317775,R21LM012395,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'Biological', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mixed Cellular Population', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Normal Cell', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,220064,0.060074347059398306
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context,9324902,R00CA172360,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metalloproteases', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Publications', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Serbia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Cell Migration', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'intravital imaging', 'live cell microscopy', 'macrophage', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiphoton imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'time use', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R00,2017,248886,0.08366368336932603
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates.

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9388399,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,446226,0.065988661767722
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9292041,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2017,347700,0.051688788960971316
"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments. Our proposed Research Center will deploy tools from systems biology to study tumor-immune system interactions at multiple stages to disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels, with the ultimate goal of informing the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.",The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC,9338202,U54CA209975,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune system', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Property', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell differentiation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'graduate student', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lectures', 'live cell imaging', 'melanoma', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outreach program', 'patient subsets', 'programs', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'undergraduate student']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U54,2017,2187373,0.05708708040741937
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9229841,F99CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor', 'tumor metabolism']",NCI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,F99,2016,32196,0.04745947494719308
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics.

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context,9144743,R00CA172360,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metalloproteases', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Publications', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Serbia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Cell Migration', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'career development', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'intravital imaging', 'live cell microscopy', 'macrophage', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'research study', 'statistics', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'time use', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R00,2016,249000,0.08366368336932603
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9150339,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,547736,0.08204382703998418
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9067260,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2016,347700,0.051688788960971316
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.

"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells.

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology.

"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation).

"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9037783,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,572285,0.08204382703998418
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,8876876,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2015,347700,0.051688788960971316

"Systems microscopy analysis of tumor cell motility in microenvironment context     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.     Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.     Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.        The written critiques and criteria scores of individual reviewers are provided in essentially unedited form in the ""Critique"" section below.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.",Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma,8473174,R01CA135509,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Angiogenesis Promoter', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Facies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'VHL mutation', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'angiogenesis', 'bHLH-PAS factor HLF', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer therapy', 'caspase-3', 'cell behavior', 'human FRAP1 protein', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'intercellular communication', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,421339,0.08445388310967245
"Enhancing tumor vascular damage with gold nanoparticles aided radiation therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent developments in anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting therapies as well as hypofractionated radiotherapy have shown the great potential of tumor vasculature as a therapeutic target for cancer medicine. We have an original idea for using targeted gold nanoparticles as vascular disruptive agents (VDA) in conjunction with clinical megavoltage photon beams. Unlike competing proposals, we recognize that gold nanoparticles tend to accumulate in, and can even be targeted for, tumor blood vessels and that these structures may be more important for anti-cancer therapy than clonogenic cell death. Due to the short distance traveled by x-ray induced photoelectrons, the endothelial cells of the tumor will receive a sizable boost in dose, even for clinical megavoltage photon irradiation. We are proposing a therapy that would be highly compatible with current clinical practice and could offer a substantial clinical benefit. Upon the successful completion of the aims, we will have demonstrated the validity of two underlying premises: 1) gold nanoparticles can be effectively, and safely, targeted to the tumor endothelium, and 2) the incidence of endothelial cell apoptosis during radiotherapy will be highly correlated to the proximity and local concentrations of gold nanoparticles.           The goal of this project is the improvement of cancer therapy by employing gold nanoparticles, specifically targeted to tumor blood vessels, during radiation therapy. These nanoparticles will give off an extra radiation dose to their immediate surroundings during therapeutic irradiation. The ensuing collapse of the tumor vasculature could lead to large scale cancer cell death and potentially halt metastasis.

"Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors  7. Project Summary/Abstract  Salivary gland tumors constitute 1-6% of head and neck tumors numbering 3600 new cases per year in the US. Though rare, there are 37 histopathological malignant subtypes and 13 benign subtypes of salivary gland tumors, making it one of the most challenging tumors to diagnose. While surgery is the main modality of treatment, advance unresectable primary, recurrent and metastatic tumors are generally fatal. The rarity of the tumors and multiple histopathological subtypes generated major clinical challenges for the early detection, diagnosis, therapeutic interventions and prognosis of patients with salivary gland tumors.  This application addresses the missing gaps in salivary gland tumor research by advancing the basic and translational sciences. Our approach is to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of salivary gland tumors using the most advanced omics technologies coupled with advanced data and bioinformatics analysis to develop tissue-based biomarkers for salivary gland malignancy detection as well as the potential use of salivary biomarkers to screen/risk assess symptomatic patients for salivary gland malignancies. In additional a systems network analysis approach (Weighted-Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis, WGCNA) will be use to examine the derived omics databases to identify pivotal molecular pathways and gene targets for salivary gland malignancy development. Collective these approaches will lead to translational and mechanistic insights for salivary tumor development that can be further translated for clinical applications as well as mechanistic evaluations using rodent models for salivary gland carcinogenesis.  Six Specific Aims are in place to test the hypothesis in this application. Aim 1 is to procure fresh frozen malignant and benign parotid gland tissues from the UCLA Head & Neck Oncology Clinic. Aim 2 is to perform comprehensive profiling of parotid gland tumors' transcriptome; microRNA and epigenome using most advanced RNA sequencing and methylomics arrays. Aim 3 will perform statistical and bioinformatics analysis for the omics databases to select candidate biomarkers that can detect parotid gland malignancies. These candidate biomarkers will be pre-validated in Aim 4 in an independent cohort of parotid gland malignant and benign tumors. Aim 5 is to explore the hypothesis that tissue-based dysregulated biomarkers in malignant parotid glands are concordantly dysregulated in saliva of these patients. Finally Aim 6 is a systems network based analysis of the omics databases to identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are pivotal in the development of parotid gland malignancies. These pathway and targets outcome can be evaluated in future mechanistic studies in salivary gland malignancy development by rodent models or cell lines.  Our multidisciplinary research team has the expertise and track record to carry out the proposed molecular characterization of parotid gland tumors as well as expertise to carryout the mechanistic and translational next steps to fully materialize the goals of this RFA.  8. Relevance to Public Health Statement  Salivary gland tumors are rare. However, they are aggressive and fatal. Due to its rarity (1-6% of head and neck cancers) and the fact that there are 24 variants of salivary gland cancers and 13 variants of benign subtypes, clinical diagnosis of salivary gland tumor is one of the worst, hampering treatment decisions and prognostics outcomes of patients. This application takes the novel and impactful approach to generate the most comprehensive molecular profile of salivary gland tumors to develop molecular signatures of salivary gland malignancies, saliva based biomarkers for early detection of salivary gland cancers and informatics outcomes that will identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are involved in the mechanistic development of salivary gland malignancies. The outcomes of this application are molecular signatures of parotid gland cancer to assist clinical diagnosis; salivary biomarkers to assist early detection of salivary gland cancers and identified biological pathways and gene targets for mechanistic evaluation in rodent models for salivary gland tumor carcinogenesis.",Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors,8534892,R56DE023241,"['Abbreviations', 'Acinar Cell Carcinoma', 'Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma', 'Adenolymphoma', 'Basic Science', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of salivary gland', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Parotid Cancer', 'Parotid Gland', 'Parotid Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Public Health', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent Model', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms', 'Salivary Glands', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'abstracting', 'adenoma', 'antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'insight', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R56,2012,211387,0.04975515843050841
"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Enhancing tumor vascular damage with gold nanoparticles aided radiation therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent developments in anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting therapies as well as hypofractionated radiotherapy have shown the great potential of tumor vasculature as a therapeutic target for cancer medicine. We have an original idea for using targeted gold nanoparticles as vascular disruptive agents (VDA) in conjunction with clinical megavoltage photon beams. Unlike competing proposals, we recognize that gold nanoparticles tend to accumulate in, and can even be targeted for, tumor blood vessels and that these structures may be more important for anti-cancer therapy than clonogenic cell death. Due to the short distance traveled by x-ray induced photoelectrons, the endothelial cells of the tumor will receive a sizable boost in dose, even for clinical megavoltage photon irradiation. We are proposing a therapy that would be highly compatible with current clinical practice and could offer a substantial clinical benefit. Upon the successful completion of the aims, we will have demonstrated the validity of two underlying premises: 1) gold nanoparticles can be effectively, and safely, targeted to the tumor endothelium, and 2) the incidence of endothelial cell apoptosis during radiotherapy will be highly correlated to the proximity and local concentrations of gold nanoparticles.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is the improvement of cancer therapy by employing gold nanoparticles, specifically targeted to tumor blood vessels, during radiation therapy. These nanoparticles will give off an extra radiation dose to their immediate surroundings during therapeutic irradiation. The ensuing collapse of the tumor vasculature could lead to large scale cancer cell death and potentially halt metastasis.              The goal of this project is the improvement of cancer therapy by employing gold nanoparticles, specifically targeted to tumor blood vessels, during radiation therapy.

"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care. What makes this project a ""grand opportunity"" is the pursuit of rapid progress through a highly multidisciplinary team that will draw on new advances in the areas of cell lineage behaviors, cancer stem cells, three-dimensional mathematical and computational modeling, and machine-learning.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down. We hypothesize that, within the details of how a tumor grows lie important clues about the nature of feedback processes-including those that still remain or may be re-activated. By describing how such clues can be found, we will be defining a new approach for predicting how individual tumors behave in cancer patients, and how they respond to different kinds of therapy.              Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down.

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using gene expression profiling to discriminate 21 different tumor types with an accuracy of 88%. The performance of this classifier, however, was principally limited by the use of multiple platforms for analysis. This proposal seeks to build a new gene expression classifier on a single, commercially available, genome-wide oligonucleotide platform, with a focus on the most problematic primary and metastatic tumors of the liver. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we plan to validate the classifier with independent test sets that will also be profiled by standard IHC approaches; the results of molecular classification will then be compared head to head with standard pathological classification for accuracy of diagnosis. To further translate the technology, we will select core classifier genes and perform validation with real time quantitative PCR. Finally, the molecular classifiers will be tested using prospectively acquired biopsy samples on tissues of known and unknown sites of origin.           n/a",Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors,7903971,R01CA112215,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Antibodies', 'Biliary', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Line', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon', 'Colon Adenocarcinoma', 'Community Hospitals', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Endoscopy', 'Ensure', 'Esophageal', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hepatic', 'Histologic', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metastatic Adenocarcinoma', 'Metastatic Lesion', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Microfluidics', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'bile duct', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'performance site', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care. What makes this project a ""grand opportunity"" is the pursuit of rapid progress through a highly multidisciplinary team that will draw on new advances in the areas of cell lineage behaviors, cancer stem cells, three-dimensional mathematical and computational modeling, and machine-learning.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down. We hypothesize that, within the details of how a tumor grows lie important clues about the nature of feedback processes-including those that still remain or may be re-activated. By describing how such clues can be found, we will be defining a new approach for predicting how individual tumors behave in cancer patients, and how they respond to different kinds of therapy.              Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down.

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors PROVIDED.  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Direct MALDI-ToF analysis of LCM-selected tissue & tumor DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to improve the quality of differential cancer diagnostics and metastatic tumor origination using protein and carbohydrate biomarker detection of patient biopsies, BioAnalyte Inc. and collaborators at MGH and JHMI propose to develop laser capture microdissection (LCM) as a sample preparation system for the biomolecular profiling capabilities of MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. The work will first optimize protocols for collecting cells from mammalian tissue for MALDI-ToF analysis. For differential diagnostics we will analyze several LCM-selected cells from the tumor collection at MGH representing a variety of cancers will be used to determine the MALDI-ToF profiles of transformed and adjoining normal tissue. For identification of a metastatic tumor with its primary, we will make MALDI-ToF MS profiles of LCM-selected cells from metastatic cancers and compare them to profiles of LCM-selected cells in the original tissue. New software about written for general MALDI-ToF chemometric analysis of profiles WII be implemented here to determine fingerprint regions of the mass spectra in each of its applications.

"CLINICAL CORRELATIVE STUDIES OF NEUROBLASTOMA DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract):  Neuroblastoma is the       most common extra cranial tumor of childhood, and cases are highly               heterogenous with regard to clinical behavior.  Although patient groups with     different expected survivals can be identified by clinical staging at            diagnosis, individual clinically defined risk groups include patients with       quite different outcomes.  Inter- and intra-stage diversity provides             opportunities for identifying molecular genetic and biologic properties of       tumors that are associated with treatment outcome.  Such correlations can        identify risk groups that otherwise are not recognizable, thus aiding in the     interpretation of clinical studies, and they can provide new criteria for        more appropriate therapy assignment.  They may also suggest new approaches       to therapy.  The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to develop tests      that improve definition of risk groups so that the most appropriate and          effective therapy can be given to each patient.                                                                                                                   The hypothesis of this application is that subsets of neuroblastomas can be      identified by evaluating (1) genes that are critically involved in               neuroblastoma growth, differentiation, and survival and (2) the ability of       tumor cells to grow continuously in vitro.  Plans are to build upon previous     studies of N-myc proto-oncogene expression in neuroblastoma and of the           neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, NGF, and brain derived neurotrophic          factor, BDNF) and their receptors (e.g., TrkAl), and of tumor cell growth in     vitro, which demonstrated the potential importance of these markers in           prognostication.                                                                                                                                                  The specific aims are as follows:  (1) determine if tumor phenotype defined      by MYCN gene amplification and expression, TrkA expression, telomerase RNA       expression, and growth in vitro correlates with disease progression during       or after therapy; (2) develop multivariate statistical models for predicting     outcome based upon clinical presentation (stage and age) and laboratory data     (tumor MYCN gene amplification, TrkA expression, telomerase RNA expression,      growth in vitro, and histopathology); (3) determine in a pilot study if          expression of other neurotrophins and their receptors defines risk groups.       If so, include these in the above analyses.                                                                                                                       The CCG performs phase III studies in which newly diagnosed patients receive     therapy according to risk classification, which is currently based upon          clinical stage, age, histopathology, and N-myc gene amplification status.        Approximately 200 patients are registered annually in studies for low,           intermediate, and high-risk neuroblastoma.  Tumor tissues including (in some     patients) bone marrow with tumor are obtained at diagnosis prospectively.        Tumors are tested to determine their phenotype with regard to N-myc              amplification, trk RNA expression level and pattern of expression, BDNF RNA      expression, telomerase RNA expression and activity, chromosome 1p deletions,     and tumor cell growth in vitro.  The goal is to determine if these               laboratory test results can identify clinically important but small subsets      of patients who may benefit from different therapy.  If preliminary studies      indicate that specific tests are particularly important in predicting            prognosis, large-scale studies will be conducted to better define the value      of these new tests (e.g., their ability to identify patients who will likely     fail treatment).                                                                                                                                                  It is anticipated that these studies will improve prognostication and that       they may contribute to development of novel and possibly more effective          therapies for high-risk patients, while diminishing the risks of treatment       for low risk patients.                                                            n/a",CLINICAL CORRELATIVE STUDIES OF NEUROBLASTOMA,6403183,R01CA060104,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' artificial intelligence', ' cancer risk', ' child (0-11)', ' clinical research', ' cooperative study', ' gene expression', ' growth factor receptors', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' loss of heterozygosity', ' mathematical model', ' molecular oncology', ' neoplasm /cancer chemotherapy', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neuroblastoma', ' neurotrophic factors', ' pediatric neoplasm /cancer', ' polymerase chain reaction', ' protooncogene', ' receptor expression', ' telomerase', ' telomere', ' tumor suppressor genes']",NCI,NATIONAL CHILDHOOD CANCER FOUNDATION,R01,2001,420741,0.04102521026883432
"TISSUE AND SERUM INDICATORS OF LUNG CANCER RECURRENCE Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer morality       in men and women in the United States, and the overall long-term survial is      less than 15%.  Pathologic stage I makes up  25-35% of NSCLC cases and has       a good prognosis.  However, cancer relapse and death rate in this subset is      35 to 50% by 5 years.  Chemotherapy is beneficial for the treatment of           several localized solid tumors after resection and may prove to be useful        in the treatment of patients with stage I NSCLC.  Thr purpose of this            project is to define tissue and serum tumor markers in patients with stage       I NSCLC which predict for early cancer recurrence.  Pathologic stage I           NSCLC was chosen for study to eliminate the significant influence of             positive lymph nodes and distant metastases on survival.                         Immunohistochemical staining will identify potential tissue tumor markers        and radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will       identify potential serum tumor markers.                                                                                                                           Specific aim #1 will examine a set of twelve tissue tumor markers in a           retrospective cohort of 275 stage I NSCLC patients.  Markers are                 categorized by hypothetical method of action: molecular genetic markers          (Kras, erbB-1, erbB-2, rb, p53, bcl-2), markers of metastatic propensity         (angiogenesis factor viii), proliferation markers (K1-67) and markers of         cellular differentiation (Blood group A, H/LeV/LeB, NCAM, CD44).  Results        will be used to develop a prediction rule for recurrence in stage I NSCLC        using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and an artificial neural      network.                                                                                                                                                          Specific aim #2 will examine a set of eight serum tumor markers in a             retrospective cohort of 250 patients with stage I to IV NSCLC.  These            markers are categorized as molecular genetic markers (anti-p53), markers of      metastatic propensity (angiogenesis bFGF), somatamedins (growth factor IGF-      1) and markers of cellular differentiation (CEA, CA-125, CA 15-3, CYFRA21-       1, CD44).  The purpose of this aim is to identify any correlations between       titers of serum markers and tumor histology, stage or mass.  One hundred         patients in this cohort had a second serum collection after tumor                resection.  This subgroup of serum will allow analyses of titters before         and after cyto-reduction.  Significant correlates with tumor stage and mass      will be evaluated in a prospective cohort of patients with stage I NSCLC.                                                                                         In specific aim #3, paraffin-embedded and fresh-frozen tumor tissue will be      collected from a prospective cohort of 330 patients with stage I NSCLC to        validate the prediction rule developed in specific aim #1.  In these same        patients, serial serum specimens will be collected for a minimum of 2.0          years after resection (specific aim #4).  The significant markers                identified in specific aim #2 will be analyzed in this cohort to describe        correlations with tumor recurrence.  Tissue and serum markers identified by      the model can be used to select high risk patients for a prospective,            multi-institutional chemotherapy trial for stage I NSCLC.                         n/a",TISSUE AND SERUM INDICATORS OF LUNG CANCER RECURRENCE,6172943,R29CA073980,"['angiogenesis factor', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomarker', ' cell differentiation', ' clinical research', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', ' genetic markers', ' histopathology', ' human subject', ' immunocytochemistry', ' insulinlike growth factor', ' longitudinal human study', ' mathematical model', ' metastasis', ' neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' neoplasm /cancer relapse /recurrence', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer', ' prognosis', ' respiratory surgery', ' serology /serodiagnosis']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R29,2000,105136,0.0144524106522059

"Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells Project Summary/Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical success treating late-stage tumors, yet the response rates remain low and the side effects are often severe. Designing effective immunotherapies relies on accurate identification of tumor-reactive T cells. This is an extremely difficult task because 1) most of the cancer antigens are unknown; 2) the majority of the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) does not recognize cancer cells; and 3) without known antigens, the only approach to acquire such T cells is to perform ex vivo expansion of TILs stimulated by autologous cancer cells, which generates non-specific T cells and is infeasible to many patients. Nonetheless, this strategy is widely adopted in current clinical trials for anti-cancer treatment, despite its reduced therapeutic efficacy and unpredictable side effects of autoimmunity. Therefore, unbiased, antigen- independent identification of tumor-reactive T cells, if possible, will be a major clinical priority as it will significantly increase the efficiency and safety of T cell based immunotherapies. Here we propose to achieve this goal through the development of novel machine learning methods. Such approach has not yet been explored because the fundamental difference between cancer and non-cancer T cells lies in their receptor sequences (TCR), and training data of cancer-specific TCRs is currently unavailable. To prepare for this task, we have developed the software TRUST, to extract the T cell antigen-binding CDR3 regions from bulk tumor RNA-seq data, and the software iSMART to group these CDR3s into antigen-specific clusters. These tools allowed us to develop a new rationale for producing large training sets of tumor-reactive TCRs, even without knowing cancer antigens. In our preliminary analysis, we observed that TCRs from the training data can be matched to tumor antigens that bind to HLA-A*02:01 and elicit immune response in vivo. The cancer-specific CDR3 amino acid sequences also show significantly different biochemical features from non-cancer ones, based on which we further developed software DeepCAT to demonstrate the feasibility of de novo prediction of cancer TCRs. These exciting results highlighted the importance to develop better computational method to track the tumor-reactive T cells for clinical applications. Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will deliver a new machine learning method for accurate classification of tumor-reactive T cells using the CDR3 sequences. In Aim 2, we will derive a set of biomarkers for the cancer-specific T cells for fast and accurate flow sorting of these T cells from TILs. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell sequencing and functional validation of cancer-specific T cells using humanized animal model to validate the predicted genes, and to produce a prioritized list of promising targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy development. These Aims will be accomplished with the great support from the excellent collaborators specialized in cancer immunology at UTSW. Successful completion of this proposal will provide an exciting new paradigm to identify tumor-reactive T cells for precision cancer immunotherapies. Project Narrative Identification of tumor-specific T cells is critical to immunotherapy development, yet remains a challenging task. In this project we will develop a novel machine learning method to study: 1) which T cells in the tumor microenvironment are reactive to malignant cells; 2) what signature genes can be used to track the cancer- specific T cells.

"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies.

"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9997854,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CTLA4 blockade', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'driver mutation', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2020,250795,0.05851521286372501
"SimBioSys PhenoScope: A Cloud-Enabled, Web-Based Portal for Raw and Processed Cancer Phenotype Data Spanning Scales from Genomes to Tissues While genomic methods yield a plethora of information on the underlying cause and variety of cancers, genotype is only one factor contributing to the observed phenotype of a tumor. Heterogeneity among cancers and differences within individual tumors continue to challenge the efforts to develop effective therapies. A multitude of data such as single cell sequencing, digital pathology, and medical imaging are being generated that captures heterogeneity across multiple scales. However, data is siloed and connections between scales remains elusive. We propose the development of SimBioSys PhenoScope, a novel research tool to harmonize these disparate data types and provide connections between the genomic, cellular/pathway, microscopic tissue environment, and tissue scales. Combining state-of-the art machine learning, dimensionality reduction techniques, novel spatio-temporal simulation algorithms, and support for public data repositories, PhenoScope will provide a new means of assessing factors contributing to a cancer's phenotypical behavior. As an exploratory data platform, the tool will provide novel multi-scale visualizations by relying on the novel analyses between scales, that could be used by academic and pharmaceutical researchers alike to generate hypotheses for new drug targets, dosing regimens, and research targets. This technology enables researchers and clinicians to study cancer in a new light, and lead the way in to the upcoming phenomics era. n/a","SimBioSys PhenoScope: A Cloud-Enabled, Web-Based Portal for Raw and Processed Cancer Phenotype Data Spanning Scales from Genomes to Tissues",10269327,5N91020C00013,"['Algorithms', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'digital pathology', 'effective therapy', 'genome-wide', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'single cell sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'tumor', 'web portal']",NCI,"SIMBIOSYS, INC.",N01,2020,400000,0.01555610287254904
"Pathomic Predictors of Prostate Cancer Progression Abstract  Recent studies suggest that in the U.S. prostate cancer is over-detected and over-treated resulting in significant morbidity and financial costs. These problems are the product of poor sensitivity and specificity serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as a screening tool, leading to unnecessary biopsies that find small and predominantly indolent prostate tumors. While many prostate cancers should be managed with active surveillance, uncertainties surrounding available clinical tools of aggressiveness (such as PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage) will often drive patients and physicians to treatment. Attempts to improve prognostication using candidate biomarkers, mostly discovered from genomic analyses of large pieces of cancers, have had few successes, and available molecular tools provide only modest prediction, at best. An alternative to the genomic driver focus is that a combination of molecular events, under the influence of the tumor microenvironment, drive tumor’s molecular evolution and progression. Consequently, analysis of tumor characteristics detectable in pathomic data, such as heterogeneity of expression subtypes, amount of stroma, extent of microenvironmental heterogeneity, extent of immune infiltration, or extent of hypoxia, may ultimately lead to better patient stratification. Our proposal fundamentally centers around the most critical clinical question in early prostate cancer that is the basis for clinical decision making: Can we identify proteomic, imaging, and/or microenvironment features that distinguish those aggressive cancers that will progress to cause harm from benign cancers that can be safely monitored by watchful waiting?  To examine the links between the heterogeneity of early, screen-detected prostate cancers and likelihood of progression, we will interrogate a retrospective set of 225 prostatectomy patients. In Aim 1, we will use GE’s hyperplexed immune-pathology platform (Cell DIVE) to profile over 50 proteins at the cellular and subcellular level along with matrix components that define the microenvironments with the cells present in this matrix. In Aim 2, we will focus on single-cell level data and systematically extract the prevalence of the diverse cell subtypes found within these tumors. Cells will be typed along traditional axes (e.g. epithelial, CD4+ T-cells). In addition, we will use molecular and structural characteristics to define novel subtypes. Features associated with cell types (e.g. existence, prevalence, diversity) will be used alone and in combination with Gleason grading to distinguish patients with aggressive tumors that are likely to progress. Aim 3 will focus on neighborhood and regional analyses, particularly on developing approaches to extract tumor microenvironmental characteristics that have demonstrated linkages to progression (hypoxia, stromal reactivity, immune cell patterning). Using a diverse set of these features, alongside deep learning techniques on primary images, we will develop classifiers distinguishing aggressive and benign tumors. Finally, in Aim 4 we will validate classifiers in large cohorts. Project Narrative  Our proposal fundamentally centers around the most critical clinical question in early prostate cancer that is the basis for clinical decision making; namely, can we identify proteomic, imaging, and/or microenvironment features that distinguish those aggressive cancers that will progress to cause harm from benign cancers that can be safely monitored by watchful waiting?",Pathomic Predictors of Prostate Cancer Progression,9976347,R01CA249899,"['Apoptosis', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Financial cost', 'Formalin', 'Genomics', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Situ', 'Indolent', 'Infiltration', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'PI3K/AKT', 'PSA screening', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Pathway', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Uncertainty', 'adverse outcome', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer care', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early screening', 'ethnic diversity', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'molecular pathology', 'molecular phenotype', 'molecular subtypes', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'prostate cancer progression', 'serum PSA', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,910446,0.029063779219244516
"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,10000066,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,541899,0.08900392315565393
"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,9833512,R01CA218357,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Incineration', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Kansas', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung preservation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'minimal risk', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pre-clinical', 'real time monitoring', 'safety and feasibility', 'simulation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor ablation', 'virtual']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,258394,0.03522567510527224
"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy,9897497,R01CA237210,"['Antibodies', 'Antitumor Response', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granzyme', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Inflammatory', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Peptidyltransferase', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Recombinants', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Protease', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'humanized mouse', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'perforin', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'pharmacodynamic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sortase', 'success', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,340630,0.020499318156939946
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. The influence of daily rhythms on cancer biology and treatment is particularly strong.

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance. The Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC) will develop quantitative approaches to understand, study and find potential novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of solid tumors.

"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,10102369,R00CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R00,2020,249000,0.09239533682876697
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,9886211,U54CA225088,"['Achievement', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAF gene', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Newsletter', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'acquired drug resistance', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical research site', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'effector T cell', 'imaging modality', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2020,2149233,0.030327242220404373
"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments.

"Multiscale Resolution and Deep Network Approaches for Deconvolving Different Cell Types in Bulk Tumor using Single-cell Sequencing Data (scDEC) Abstract: Tumors are complex ecosystems composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Understanding the clonal cellular composition of the tumor and the non-malignant cells within the tumor ecosystem provides significant insights in the tumor recurrence, treatment, initiation, progression and metastasis. Previous studies estimated immune cell type content in bulk tumor expression data using immune cell signatures generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, with the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing methods, we can now also estimate the tumor associated non-malignant and malignant cell type contents.  In this proposal, we describe a novel deep net approach for deconvolving different cell types in bulk tumor using single-cell sequencing data (scDEC). We will also infer tumor associated copy number variation (CNV) clones and their signatures from single-cell RNA sequencing data using our novel multiscale resolution signal processing based algorithm. Our approach will estimate not only the content of different immune cell types and tumor associated non-malignant cell types but also the content of different CNV clone types in bulk tumor. Moreover, we will discover new associations between cell type content and sample phenotype such as disease survival, subtype and outcome. Our proposed project will lead to major improvements in clinical care to guide the treatment and prognosis of various types of cancer. Narrative Here we describe a novel multiscale resolution and deep net based approaches for deconvolving different cell types in bulk tumor using single cell RNA sequencing data (scDEC). Using our scDEC algorithm, we will identify novel associations between different cell type contents including immune cell, non-malignant tumor associated cell and CNV clone type contents and sample phenotypes such as disease survival.

"The Mechanism of SOX6 in Ewing Sarcoma Metastasis Project Summary Current survival rates of pediatric cancers like leukemia have seen drastic positive response in survival and treatment in the last 20 years. In stark contrast, patients with solid tumor metastasis challenge the current paradigm of intense chemotherapy treatment. Such treatments have failed to change the poor prognosis of metastatic disease indicating a need to understand the complex underpinnings of the in vivo metastatic microenvironment. This need for understanding is enhanced in pediatric patients, where metastasis is promoted by access to a large pool of undifferentiated cells. This project addresses this critical issue in Ewing sarcoma, a cancer that codifies the challenges and shortcomings of current cancer therapeutics. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant cancer of bone and soft tissue targeting children, adolescents and young adults. Overall survival rates for Ewing sarcoma patients with metastasis is abysmal at less than 20% for those with advanced disease and at 60% for those with localized tumors. One in three patients with Ewing sarcoma will have presentation of metastasis. These metrics demonstrate the desperate need to further understand the genesis of metastasis in vivo. This proposal focuses in on the role of the transcription factor SOX6 and its role in Ewing sarcoma metastasis. My preliminary zebrafish xenograft data show a clear, marked increase in metastasis with normal levels of SOX6, while SOX6 shRNA knockdown cells have less or no metastatic spread from injection site. My SOX6 knockdown proteome data show suppression of CAV1, a known gene targeting E-cadherin expression in Ewing sarcoma and increase of BCL2A1, an established anti-apoptotic protein involved in numerous cancer cells. This project’s central hypothesis is: 1) SOX6 mediated protein changes cause an increase in motility and decrease in apoptosis leading to metastasis and 2) that upon metastasis, interaction with the microenvironmental niche triggers invasive proliferative phenotypes mediated by downstream targets of SOX6. These SOX6-mdediated phenotype and proteomic changes support a story of in vivo initiation and persistence of metastatic lesions in Ewing sarcoma. This proposal is the first to look at the intersection of the cell microenvironment with SOX6 to show a new pathway for advancing momentum to targeted treatment of metastasis. Using my unique background in engineering and my training in cell biology, I propose a method that remediates key failures of current treatment by understanding the initiation of metastasis in vivo, persistence of cancer cells, and microenvironmental effects fostering metastasis. This proposal unites many disciplines to offer scientific impact on the genesis of metastasis and provides an incredible opportunity to train my skills as a future independent investigator. Project Narrative: Many metastatic models of cancer fail to account for the complexity of the tumor microenvironment at the metastatic niche, and the zebrafish provides a readily imageable model to analyze human cancer metastasis using machine learning. This project looks at the in vivo role of the transcription factor SOX6 in metastatic progression of Ewing sarcoma through cell proliferation, motility change, and apoptosis suppression. Further understanding and characterization of SOX6 will provide a new pathway for understanding metastatic progression, commonly associated with poor prognosis, in human Ewing sarcoma patients.",The Mechanism of SOX6 in Ewing Sarcoma Metastasis,10017658,F31CA236410,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biosensor', 'Bone Tissue', 'CAV1 gene', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Child', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collagen', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-Cadherin', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Failure', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Injections', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Bone Neoplasm', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'SOX6 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Zebrafish', 'advanced disease', 'cancer cell', 'cell motility', 'chemotherapy', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'leukemia', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'response', 'skills', 'small hairpin RNA', 'soft tissue', 'targeted imaging', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2020,34014,0.01988665265552653
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9936120,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stimulator of Interferon Genes', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2020,714132,0.027604794356093233
"Single-cell characterization of tumor and microenvironment co-evolution in Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas Project Summary Tumor and microenvironment constitute complex ecologies involving a multitude of stromal cells, immune cells, and in some cases coexisting microbes. A paradigmatic example of complex tumor-microenvironment interactions are peripheral T-cell lymphomas, aggressive and genetically complex tumors where tumor cells often constitute a minority cell population. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas are frequently associated with the presence of Epstein-Barr virus whose role in the disease remains largely uncharacterized. We have shown that the presence of specific macrophage populations and viral transcriptional programs are associated to survival. But, how do tumor and microenvironment coevolve and inform prognosis? Our project goal is to characterize the tumor- microenvironment interactions and coevolution in peripheral T-cell lymphomas using large collections of human transcriptomic data and longitudinal single-cell sequencing data from recently developed mouse models. We will develop an approach based on random matrix theory and topological data analysis for modelling the continuous aspect of tumor microenvironment evolution. We will further deploy our lab-developed methodology for in silico pathogen detection to study the interactions between the Epstein-Barr virus and peripheral T-cell lymphoma lymphomagenesis and progression. Successful completion of our goals will provide a general, experimentally validated strategy to uncover the dynamical nature of tumor-microenvironment interactions at the single-cell resolution in tumor types with complex stromal component. Additionally, our approach will help uncover new microenvironment driven targets supporting lymphoma cell growth, with potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of this deadly disease. Narrative Tumor and microenvironment coexist and coevolve determining clinical outcomes.

"Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ABSTRACT  The principle investigator, Dr. Travis Schrank, MD, PhD, is a first-year faculty member in the University of North Carolina Department of Otolaryngology. He has been hired in a surgeon-scientist role and presently has 75% protected time for research. His past training in computational biophysics and experimental biochemistry have motivated and equipped him pursue an independent research career in computational genomics and head and neck cancer molecular biology. The presented research aims are an outgrowth of the PI's ongoing efforts to improve RNA based methods for identifying NRF2 active head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors.  NRF2 is the key transcriptional regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, and has been related to poor patient outcome and radiation response in multiple cancer types. Mutational activation of NRF2 is observed in 8% of HPV negative (HPV-) HNSCC. However, our estimates based on RNA transcription suggest that NRF2 is aberrantly activated in 24% of HPV- HNSCC. This work has identified atypical NRF2 and CUL3 variants which are associated with NRF2 activation. The functional consequences of these variants will be investigated (Aim 1). We also find that the prohormone Neurotensin is highly expressed in NRF2 active HNSCC tumors without NRF2 pathway mutations. Our preliminary data suggest that pro-Neurotensin may activate NRF2, through a previously unreported interaction with KEAP1 (a regulator of NRF2 stability). This novel function of pro-Neurotensin will be investigated in Aim 2. Suppression of NRF2 activity is well known to radio-sensitize cancer cells. We have also identified a partially suppressed pattern of NRF2 target expression in HPV associated (HPV+) HNSCC tumors, which are highly sensitive to radiation. p14ARF is also highly expressed in HPV+ HNSCC, binds NRF2, and suppresses transactivation of some NRF2 targets. Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that NRF2 target suppression due to high levels of p14ARF, contributes to the radio-sensitivity of these tumors.  The proposed work will be impactful for several reasons, 1) the tumor subclassification method developed address the very common problem of imperfect clinical/genomic annotations of tumor RNA expression data, 2) the first known/reported signaling role for the prohormone form of Neurotensin will be explored, and 3) identification of NRF2 targets associated with radiation response may suggest novel approaches to treatment.  UNC has exceptionally strong institutional expertise and resources related to cancer genomics. The mentorship committee also has key project specific expertise in NRF2 biology, computational genomics, p14ARF and Neurotensin. Collectively the mentorship team has previously trained four K award recipients and includes two surgeon-scientists who can provide critical career guidance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant activation of the transcription factor NRF2, a key regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, is frequently seen in HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally validated somatic mutations of this pathway can only account for 30% of the observed activation.

"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9981710,R01CA234557,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow', 'COL1A2 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cancer Patient', 'Castration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Indolent', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Oncogenic', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'androgen sensitive', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'cell stroma', 'clinically significant', 'conditioning', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome editing', 'host neoplasm interaction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'molecular oncology', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer metastasis', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'response', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,488621,0.05737291103069617
"Interdisciplinary Epidemiologic Consortium to Investigate T-cell Response in Colorectal Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The immune system has pivotal influence in the evolution and progression of many tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In particular, the presence of a strong T cell response in CRC, indicating activation of the adaptive immune system, has been associated with better patient outcomes. As such, recently developed immunotherapeutic approaches often attempt to harness the adaptive immune response. Immune cells are an integral component of the tumor microenvironment, and dynamically interact with neoplastic cells. However, our understanding as to the complexity of the T cell response and the factors that drive this response remains limited. The objective of this proposal is to identify genetic, lifestyle, and tumor factors associated with the T cell response in CRC, and to characterize the survival implications of that response. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will examine the relationship of personal characteristics with T cell response in CRC, including the role of (1a) germline genetic variation within human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes, and (1b) lifestyle factors (e.g., aspirin use, smoking, alcohol consumption). In Aim 2 we will focus on several colorectal tumor characteristics as they relate to T cell response, including (2a) the presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum and bacterial toxin genes in CRC, and (2b) somatic mutations in key signaling pathways (e.g., WNT signaling and RAS/RAF). In Aim 3, we will evaluate the associations of different aspects of T cell response with CRC survival, accounting for known prognostic factors and the relationships identified in Aims 1-2. To achieve these Aims, we propose to assess the density and spatial distribution of specific T cell subsets using multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) to quantify expression levels and co-expression patterns of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, and FOXP3 at the single cell level. This multiplexed assessment will allow us to examine the epidemiologic and prognostic relevance of numerous metrics of T cell response in CRC. This research will leverage the resources of the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). GECCO-CCFR is a large collaborative effort between observational studies of CRC. We have completed genome-wide germline genotyping and have harmonized epidemiologic data regarding a variety of lifestyle factors and personal characteristics for all participating studies. We are conducting DNA sequencing with a panel of 205 human genes and a small number of bacterial genes in CRC tumor tissue. Prospective follow-up for survival is ongoing, and we have harmonized existing survival data. Through this project, we will add information on T cell response in CRC for >2,500 CRC cases to the GECCO-CCFR resource. This project provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the epidemiology of the T cell response in CRC and the relationship of that response with personal and tumor characteristics. Insights gained through this novel study could ultimately inform the development and targeted implementation of emerging immunotherapeutic and immunopreventative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE In this large, collaborative effort, we will examine how germline genetics, lifestyle factors, and tumor characteristics relate to the profile of T cells in colorectal cancers, and how those T cell profiles relate to cancer survival. The results of this work may ultimately inform strategies to harness the immune system for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.",Interdisciplinary Epidemiologic Consortium to Investigate T-cell Response in Colorectal Cancer,9947639,R01CA248857,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Immune System', 'Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteroides fragilis toxin', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Fusobacterium nucleatum', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Killer Cells', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mutate', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Proteins', 'Ras/Raf', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Smoking', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spatial Distribution', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'WNT Signaling Pathway', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer survival', 'cell mediated immune response', 'cell type', 'colon cancer family registry', 'colon cancer patients', 'colorectal cancer treatment', 'combinatorial', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'homeobox protein PITX1', 'immune function', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'macrophage', 'microbial', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'survival outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,768324,0.04284735330320371
"Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients The EGFR-MAPK pathway is a key signaling pathway in human Triple Negative Beast Cancers (TNBC). We propose to leverage genomic and proteomic data from a rich animal model system, and 2 human clinical trials, to build predictive models of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway activity for TNBC patients. The heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered previous development of predictive pathway-based computational models because most approaches are based on experimental data from a single cell line or animal model that is then extrapolated to fit multiple tumor subtypes. Our approach is to use a diverse experimental model system that reflects the heterogeneous disease subtypes, and then use two distinct and complementary methods to build the computational model. We will simultaneously use mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches, at a variety of scales, that incorporate data from drug treated tumors and cell lines, assayed for gene expression, DNA copy number, DNA mutations, and protein kinome activity. Lastly, we will test these computational models on human tumors to evaluate their predictive performance. Project Narrative Breast cancer is not one disease, but instead, represents multiple diseases. Each of these unique subtypes requires a different therapeutic approach, thus, determining which new drugs will benefit each disease subtype is critical. To address this need, we are focusing on one of the most therapeutically difficult to treat breast cancer subtypes, namely Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC). We also propose to develop a mathematical representation of a key growth regulating pathway (i.e. EGFR-MAPK) that will predict its activity in TNBC patients, and thus could be used to guide therapies to those patients who have this pathway active within their tumors. We will ultimately test our predictive model on human tumors coming from clinical trials, and if successful, we will have developed a new biomarker for guiding TNBC patient treatments through the use of objective mathematical models",Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,9928400,U01CA238475,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'Erlotinib', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Inbred BALB C Mice', 'Individual', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'MAPK Signaling Pathway Pathway', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Normal Cell', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell growth', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning network', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neoplastic cell', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'treatment strategy', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2020,694019,-0.03597567306082511
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,9842277,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,413430,0.03319223677333614
"Targeting the Immune Onco-GPCRome  as a Novel Multimodal Cancer Immunotherapy Strategy ABSTRACT Recent advances in checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBI) inhibiting programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the limited response rates in most cancers suggest that new approaches and targets are clearly needed to fully elucidate the underlying biology of dysfunctional and exhausted CD8 T cells in cancer and achieve durable responses (cure). G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most intensively studied drug targets since they play key roles in many physiological processes, and they have remained longstanding favorable pharmacological targets. Here, we plan to first use novel computational approaches analyzing multiple single cell RNAseq databases to deconvolute T cell heterogeneity in order to generate a transcriptomic GPCR signature for tumor infiltrating T cells. Preliminary data shows an upregulation of prostaglandin receptors, EP2 and EP4, on exhausted T cells, suggesting that these GPCRs that are coupled to the G protein Gs, and their downstream signaling cascades may be dampening anti-tumor cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, leading to exhaustion. We hypothesize that activation of EP2 and EP4 on CD8 T cells and the subsequent Gs signaling leads to decreased cytotoxic and migratory activity that nullifies the effectiveness of PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade. Put together, EP2 and EP4 may represent promising candidates as immune checkpoints that can be targeted in combination with CBI as part of novel multimodality precision immunotherapy approach to reactivate the immune system to destroy tumors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have led to major treatment breakthroughs for a number of different cancers, but the majority of the cancer patients do not respond to immunotherapies, and clinical responses are often not durable. The research outlined in this proposal will illuminate the roles of G protein coupled receptors on immune cells in cancer that may lead to the identification of novel targets that need to be blocked in combination with current immunotherapies to achieve complete responses (cure).",Targeting the Immune Onco-GPCRome  as a Novel Multimodal Cancer Immunotherapy Strategy,9992888,F31CA250488,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Antigens', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Bypass', 'CD28 gene', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CTLA4 gene', 'CXCR3 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dinoprostone', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Functional disorder', 'G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'G-substrate', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Graph', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Heterogeneity', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapy', 'In complete remission', 'Joints', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Production', 'Prostaglandin Receptor', 'Receptor Activation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Diseases', 'WFDC2 gene', 'anti-tumor immune response', 'antitumor effect', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell motility', 'chemokine receptor', 'cytokine', 'cytotoxic', 'cytotoxicity', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'expression vector', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'migration', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'receptor', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F31,2020,38401,0.027267949917875515
