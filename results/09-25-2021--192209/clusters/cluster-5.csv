"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment. We will experimentally validate these predictions in-house or through our network of collaborators.",MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions,9846761,R43AT010585,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Fingerprint', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'commercial application', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'novel', 'open data', 'pharmacophore', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'process repeatability', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'software development', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NCCIH,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2019,68862,0.032608597222760514
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is visible by the growth in companies and increasing deals over the past year between pharma and smaller companies using machine learning to assist in drug discovery. The continuing steady growth of structure-activity data for diverse targets, diseases and molecular properties poses a considerable challenge as they are generally not readily accessible for machine learning: content resides in a mixture of public databases (with differing levels of curation), disparate files within research groups, non- curated literature publications. In Phase I, Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed a prototype of Assay Central software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. Public data was mixed with collaborator/customer-contributed data, using original software and applied chemistry judgment of an expert team. In Phase I we created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software environment that we created readily enables the user to compile structure-activity data for building computational models and can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed. This software can in turn be used for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. We have enabled ~14 collaborative projects which have shared models on specific targets such as PyrG for Tuberculosis (identifying a lead compound), HIV reverse transcriptase, whole cell screening for Leishmaniasis as well as P450 and nuclear receptor models (e.g. estrogen receptor) relevant to toxicology. We have utilized Assay Central in our ongoing internal projects working on Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis small molecule drug discovery. In Phase II, we propose the following aims that will enable us to develop Assay Central into a production tool for enabling drug discovery collaborations which we will continue to focus on. In Phase 1 we performed a preliminary analysis of different machine learning algorithms with select drug discovery datasets. In Phase II we will now perform a thorough evaluation and selection of additional machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors as well as assessment of combination of algorithms (e.g. Bayesian and Deep Learning). We will implement disease/target definitions for machine learning models to facilitate drug discovery. We will enable molecule selection and automated design and optimization. The utility of having such a tool as Assay Central readily available will empower scientists to leverage public, private or a combination of data to help with their drug discovery tasks. Developing this software suite of computational models with public data will enable us to identify foundations, academics and potential collaborators that generate preliminary data to test models. These efforts will dramatically increase the number of projects we can work on, create new IP, and generate employment using machine learning focused on drug discovery in the area of rare and neglected diseases, in particular. Assay Central benefits include 1. Ease of deployment and use with a Java file executed by users without the need for IT support; 2. Built on industry standard technologies; 3. Graphical display of models provides instant feedback; 4 Model applicability with multiple methods to assess scores and graphics. Project Narrative In Phase I Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. have developed a prototype of ‘Assay Central’ software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. The software environment that we created readily enables us to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators and has been used successfully to find promising lead compounds for many collaborators. We now propose in Phase II to optimize the underlying machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors (e.g. combining Bayesian and Deep Learning), linking potentially thousands of rare and neglected diseases to the machine learning models, and automating molecule selection and new molecule design to enable further high value drug discovery collaborations with Assay Central.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9751326,R44GM122196,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Client', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ebola virus', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Fees', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'HIV/TB', 'Industry Standard', 'Intelligence', 'Intention', 'Java', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leishmaniasis', 'Licensing', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training Support', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Update', 'Vendor', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'computational suite', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'exhaustion', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'scale up', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R44,2019,692845,0.03591547234294499
"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. In some cases, the computational models are derived from discrete molecular endpoints while in others they are quite broad in scope. Considerable progress has been made in computational toxicology in a decade both in model development and availability such that the next generation of larger scale models will promote it to the next level and further focus in vitro and in vivo testing on verification of select predictions. Pharmaceutical, consumer products and other chemistry focused companies possess structure-activity data generated over many decades of screening that is not in the public domain, and this data is primarily only accessible to the cheminformatics experts in each company. Outside of these companies small biotechs and academics must rely on data from public databases, commercial databases and their own data. Integrating such data and processing it to build algorithms that can help with predictive models is a vast undertaking. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity related and drug discovery endpoints. Drug companies tend to focus on target related information whereas there might be an opportunity to understand toxicity also. Our work with a consumer product company indicated the need for accessing machine learning models based on the growing public datasets could be a commercially viable product. Without massive legacy internal data many of small drug discovery and consumer product companies will have to make do with data accessible in PubChem, ChEMBL or other public databases (ToxCast, Tox21 etc) only. In this proposal we will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms (Bayesian, Support vector machines, random forest and Deep Neural Networks as just some examples) for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo datasets. We are not aware of any other company pursuing such an approach to create as wide an array of toxicity models. We are also not aware of other software companies in the toxicity model space generating their own experimental data to test the models. Such a technology could have very broad utility for other pharmaceutical companies, biotechs, consumer product companies, regulatory groups and academic research groups. As we have been working for several years to build up technologies and experience in cheminformatics and software development it would be relatively straightforward for us to build the core foundations of MegaTox and deliver them to potential customers. This technology will also be used in our consulting projects with pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. Project Narrative The objective of ‘MegaTox’ is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating toxicity data, and machine learning models. This will enable the prediction of various toxicity endpoints relevant to pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. We will use the latest machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated public datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system. We will use MegaTox internally for our own drug discovery projects as well as leverage it for consulting for clients so we can combine public and private datasets and increase the coverage of chemical property space.

"MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models Summary Being able to predict interactions with important human transporters would be of value to new drug design to avoid compounds that interact with them and cause undesirable side effects. OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3) are `uptake' transporters largely restricted to the sinusoidal aspect of hepatocytes. They both transport a wide variety of structurally-unrelated compounds, including members of several clinically im- portant drug families such as statins, sartans and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We now propose to test over 1000 drugs against 2 substrates for each transporter in vitro. We will then use these data to curate and validate machine learning models. We will also use an array of machine learning methods as well as multiple model evaluation metrics. This will enable us to develop a web-based software tool called MegaTrans that will encourage the user to input their own compound structures and generate predictions for interactions with transporter/s of interest and then visualize the similarity to the training set of each model using several different visualization methods. The return on investment of such a tool would be that it could assist in the design and selection of more favorable compounds that avoid transporters of interest while also saving time and money. It could also identify compounds that are already approved that might present a drug interaction risk. Predicting such behavior seen in vivo is ideal and will lead to the prioritization of compounds to test in vitro for potential drug-drug interactions. In Phase II we would greatly expand the number of transporters which we would generate data on and build models such that we could address all the major transporters of interest to drug discovery. Narrative The objective of “MegaTrans” is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating human trans- porter data into drug discovery pipelines, as well as enabling its analysis and visualization. This will then enable improved computational tool development for in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of xenobiotic exposures across a range of assay types. It will also assist with developing computational tools for quantitatively modeling drug-drug interactions of xenobiotics. Across Phase I and Phase II we will generate data for transporters which currently have a paucity of data in the public domain, use validated machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system to enable predictions.",MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models,9768844,R41GM131433,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Modelings', 'Ensure', 'Estradiol', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescein', 'Glucuronides', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Products', 'Online Systems', 'Organic Cation Transporter', 'Output', 'POU2F2 gene', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'Xenobiotics', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'side effect', 'software development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'uptake']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R41,2019,210712,0.012243805813248687
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9705993,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314000,0.01266423122229031
"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9846025,R43MH121136,"['Animal Model', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinically relevant', 'drug classification', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2019,449973,0.03206144759053146
"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9716392,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2019,61226,0.02147938845404529
"Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding Project Summary/Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are poised to transform toxicological evaluation, however new approaches to enable their functional and structural profiling are needed to improve the utility of hiPSC -based models for predictive and mechanistic toxicology screening. This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays. The project deliverables benefit public health by improving the ability to rapidly identify liabilities in specific cardiomyocyte lineage types, thus reducing the time and cost to pinpoint cardiotoxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Project Narrative The assay and reagents established in the course of this project directly address the goals of significant initiatives to improve the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity testing, such as the FDA’s CiPA initiative and the work of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. The resulting improvements in the pace and precision of drug testing will result in public health benefit through the development of more cost-effective and safer medicines. Beyond toxicological evaluation of therapeutic compounds, our innovative technology will deliver additional benefit to public health by virtue of its utility in investigating the toxicities of environmental chemicals, in line with the focus of government agencies and initiatives such as the EPA and Tox21 in the US and EU-ToxRisk in Europe.",Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding,9761607,R44TR002572,"['Address', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug toxicity', 'Effectiveness', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry Standard', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitochondria', 'Nodal', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sarcomeres', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'cell immortalization', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical predictors', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'environmental chemical', 'expression vector', 'genome editing', 'high throughput screening', 'immortalized cell', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phase I trial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'response', 'safety assessment', 'screening', 'site-specific integration', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NCATS,"CAIRN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,821559,0.02993362004864612
"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We propose a novel strategy to develop a class of integrated quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) that create highly accurate physical models for complex biomolecular simulations. Com- bined with recently developed high-precision free energy simulation and analysis tools, the pro- posed QMFFs will overcome current critical barriers to progress for drug discovery and deliver accurate and precise predictions for drug binding afﬁnity to enhance lead optimization. The pro- posed work will be applied to understand ligand-protein binding in the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), and provide insight that may guide the design of new non-covalent and targeted covalent inhibitors to MIF and other systems.",Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications,9817829,R01GM107485,"['Affinity', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Books', 'Cations', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Free Energy', 'Halogens', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lead optimization', 'macrophage', 'mechanical force', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2019,326559,0.011643408614531812
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary We have recently used computational models to identify the protease inhibitor indinavir (used as an antiviral for HIV) as a positive allosteric modulator at the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. We now propose to build on this discovery as well as other publications describing compounds that are positive allosteric modulators of the α7- nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. We propose identifying further compounds that possess activity against this or one of 9 other targets implicated in Alzheimer’s disease using a combination of Bayesian machine learning and in vitro assays. Generating such data will enable us to potentially provide more specific compounds as well as building datasets that can be used to build predictive models to identify additional compounds with activity at these Alzheimer’s targets. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the Alzheimer’s disease scientific community. We are proposing to build and validate models based on public databases, select compounds for testing and use the data generated as a starting point for further optimization. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders that causes dementia and it is characterized by amyloid deposition of a 39-42 AA peptide (Aβ) processed from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Many palliative drugs are available for the disease but there is still an urgent need for curative drugs with greater efficacy. We need to understand the key factors involved in disease progression and their suitability as drug targets for discovering new drugs against Alzheimer's disease. We hence propose to study several of these targets for Alzheimer’s disease involving all the key steps in the pathway, including several old and new targets. We will use our ‘Assay Central’ software to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, that can be used to selected compounds to test activity in vitro as a starting point for further optimization.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9881110,R44GM122196,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'HIV', 'Indinavir', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Publications', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'alpha-bungarotoxin receptor', 'base', 'drug discovery', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro activity', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'positive allosteric modulator', 'predictive modeling']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R44,2019,188759,-0.008261546214266058
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9640405,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2019,1140875,0.05227902798736981
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets.

"High-throughput profiling of compound abuse liabilities and identification of addiction-related drug targets using an iPSC-enabled platform Project Summary/Abstract The scale of the US opioid addiction crisis clearly evidences the critical need for breakthroughs to assess compound abuse liabilities and to enable discovery of new analgesics with minimal abuse potential. We hypothesize that altered addiction-associated physiology can be modeled in co-cultured hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells and detected by profiling gene expression alterations and associated phenotypic readouts. Our proposal addresses the significant lack of physiologically-relevant tools capable of profiling relevant molecular changes that underpin addiction in the human nervous system by executing Specific Aims that encompass: (1) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; (2) execution of a phenotype-based pilot machine learning-enabled predictive abuse liability screen; and (3) combination of phenotypic profiling and gene expression analysis to characterize the molecular and cellular changes associated with compound exposure. Successful completion of our project will deliver 2 significant advances: (1) an important new technical framework to assess abuse potential of candidate therapeutics early in the development process and (2) an innovative, scalable in vitro assay platform that enables discovery of targets and associated candidate therapeutics to mitigate addiction phenotypes. These innovations will position Cairn Biosciences to initiate drug discovery programs that will bring significant societal benefit by helping to stem the growth of the US opioid crisis and reduce the mortality rates and economic burden associated with this National Emergency.

"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9761970,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,1212566,0.02183566143925107
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections.

"A Software Platform for the Identification of Cell Surface Antigens Using RNA-seq Data Human monoclonal antibodies are among the fastest growing therapeutic modalities, with over sixty compounds approved by FDA to treat infections, autoimmunity, chronic inflammation and cancer. In combination, these diseases are responsible for the deaths of 50 million people annually, according to the World Health Organization. However, the advent of therapeutic immunologics is expected to significantly reduce the associated morbidity and mortality, particularly for oncologic diseases. Currently, 15 immuno-oncologic (IO) treatments are commercially available and comprise a growing market that is expected to reach $100B by 2022. IO therapeutics effectively attack cancer by selectively binding tumor-specific protein domains on the cell surface, referred to as tumor-associated ectodomains (TAEs). However, many cancers remain insensitive to available IO as effective and safe TAEs are difficult to identify. Standard methods to detect TAEs are costly, time-consuming and limited in their ability to discover novel targets, necessitating the development of innovative technologies to circumvent this burden. RNAseq is currently the most effective method to discover novel splicing isoforms, is high-throughput, sensitive and inexpensive. Envisagenics has been at the forefront of RNAseq- based splicing characterization since the release of its SpliceCore® platform. Here, we propose to develop SpliceIO, a novel drug discovery platform that integrates the Envisagenics’ SpliceCore knowledge base with machine learning algorithms to enable rapid identification of aberrant splicing-derived TAEs using RNAseq data. In this Phase I SBIR proposal, we will develop and apply SpliceIO in the context of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, a cancer particularly resistant to IO but highly associated with splicing mis-regulation and mutations within key spliceosome components. We will identify and validate TAEs in vitro using established leukemia cell lines and patient-derived bone marrow aspirates in collaboration with Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Collectively, the aims outlined herein will allow us to both develop and validate a novel splicing-dependent TAE identification platform to provide new sources of drug targets while dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with their development. In addition, this will allow Envisagenics to create new partnership opportunities for IO co- development with pharmaceutical companies. If successful, this pipeline can be used to identify drug targets and/or biomarkers for patient stratification in cancer and inflammatory diseases in the context of an SBIR Phase II grant. Despite the recent success of immune-based treatments in melanoma, the majority of cancers remain insensitive and resistant to therapy, necessitating the development of approaches to rapidly identify novel drug targets. Here, we propose to build a target discovery platform that combines our proprietary database of RNA splicing mutations in cancers with machine learning to identify the most clinically-relevant targets for subsequent drug development.",A Software Platform for the Identification of Cell Surface Antigens Using RNA-seq Data,9909639,R43CA246950,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antibodies', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line', 'Cell surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Grant', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense-Mediated Decay', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Databases', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Tumor-Derived', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'immunogenic', 'innovative technologies', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'response', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,"ENVISAGENICS, INC.",R43,2019,301502,-0.0019519413501525146
"A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus PROJECT SUMMARY Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) is a group of closely related nontuberculous mycobacteria, which primarily cause infections in persons with underlying lung disease, compromised immunity or other risk factors. MABSC organisms are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and treatment requires many months of multiple antibiotics, often with significant toxicity and low cure rates. One of the difficulties in optimizing the treatment of MABSC infections is the lack of a robust pipeline for the identification of multidrug regimens that may be more efficacious than the current standard of care. A strategy for prioritizing multidrug regimens is necessary, because the number of combinations to test can be overwhelming. For example, with even just 12 drugs to select from there are 220 potential 3 drug combinations. This project proposes to develop INDIGO (INferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning modeling approach, to identify drug combinations with strong potential synergistic activity against MABSC and to test these regimens in an animal model. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Build and refine an INDIGO-MABSC model through the collection of transcriptomic data from drug treated MABSC cultures, subsequent experimental verification of antibiotic synergy and antagonism followed by model refinement with iterative rounds of model building and testing; 2) Assess the efficacy of top predicted synergistic multidrug regimens in a zebrafish model for MABSC infection. INDIGO modeling is modular, so as new agents become available they may be incorporated into the model to make predictions for how these agents may be best combined into multidrug regimens. The overall goal of this project is to provide a streamlined pipeline for identifying regimens that can be pushed into advanced pre-clinical and clinical trials for treatment of MABSC infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bacteria from the Mycobacterium abscessus group cause lung and other infections in persons with underlying medical comorbidities, which are incredibly difficult to treat due to the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. This project uses gene expression profiling, computer modeling, and a zebrafish infection model to identify new combination antibiotic regimens that may be more effective against Mycobacterium abscessus. Results from these studies could prompt future clinical trials to test these regimens in humans for efficacy.",A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus,9727503,R21AI144536,"['Adjuvant', 'American', 'Amikacin', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Bronchiectasis', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Antibiotics', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Imipenem', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Macrolides', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mycobacterium Infections', 'Mycobacterium abscessus', 'Mycobacterium avium Complex', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'New Agents', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Societies', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Triage', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Tuberculosis', 'Veins', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'data registry', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug testing', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'model building', 'non-tuberculosis mycobacteria', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient screening', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process', 'treatment optimization']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,280873,-0.010809989176262814
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating information about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commercial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to formalizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to become the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  CDD will first develop the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. The most innovative part of the project and the bulk of the effort will be to develop a sophisticated automated translation tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that MInChI can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxicology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicology of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9826639,R43TR002528,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'data structure', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2019,54833,0.04062395054373838
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9613245,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,352125,0.03730181952766111
"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9720905,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,291940,0.075634491382644
"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that re-purposes known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging. In this SBIR fast-track proposal we will:  PHASE I Identify a morphological profile of senescence in a variety of human cell types. Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic diseases of aging affect a significant proportion of Americans. Cellular senescence, a useful biological program which prevents replication of cells exposed to various stresses that may be at risk of initiating tumors, has long-term deleterious inflammatory effects. We will combine biological, imaging, and computational approaches to identify complex morphological profiles associated with senescence, to identify senescence- killing effects of known drugs, and to evaluate any hits in relevant models of aging.",Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction,9792234,R44AG053131,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Aging', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Initiators', 'age related', 'cell type', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'healthspan', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'senescence', 'tool']",NIA,"RECURSION PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC",R44,2019,434004,0.00804768946290952
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9995278,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'CXCL11 gene', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Site', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,64234,0.075634491382644
"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries.

"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9732293,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,31648,0.013714296099327698
"Lung-on-a-chip pulmonary fibrosis model for drug discovery LUNG-ON-A-CHIP PULMONARY FIBROSIS MODEL FOR DRUG DISCOVERY PROJECT SUMMARY Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a devastating disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and associated scar formation that compromises breathing function and often leads to respiratory failure and death. There are multiple etiologies of PF, including environmental particles, radiation, and even certain antibiotics, but in most cases patients are diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) where the specific trigger is unknown. There is no cure for IPF as current treatments are only capable of slowing lung damage, and prognosis is poor, with a median survival time of 2.5 to 3.5 years after diagnosis. A significant barrier to the development of PF therapeutics is interspecies differences in lung physiology and associated inflammatory and immune responses such that animal models do not sufficiently recapitulate certain aspects of the disease. Recent advances in human organs-on-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture systems that recapitulate the multicellular architecture, tissue-tissue interfaces, mechanical environment (e.g., cyclic breathing motions), and vascular perfusion of major organ functional units have allowed for physiologically based evaluation of cell, environmental, and drug interactions within an organ-level context in vitro. We can utilize these Organ Chips to gain complementary data to animal models about the role of specific cellular contributions to PF development. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop a human Organ Chip model of PF to better understand the mechanism of fibrosis development and progression, and to discover potential new therapeutics that could slow disease progression or reverse this deadly disease. This goal will be achieved with the following two aims: human PF Chips will be engineered with myofibroblasts from healthy donors and PF patients, with the addition of various environmental stimuli as well as potential inflammatory and immune contributors implicated in PF development (Aim 1), and transcriptomics data from these PF Chips will be compared to existing genomics literature data to identify drugs to use as potential PF therapeutics, prioritizing for clinically approved drugs that can be repurposed (Aim 2). This approach is innovative because it will be the first to incorporate all the major components of a human lung microenvironment critical for fibrosis development (human tissue-tissue interactions, breathing motions, perfusion, and environmental stimuli). Completion of these aims will enable analysis of the mechanism of PF development, with the capability to rapidly repurpose existing FDA- approved drugs as potentially life-saving PF therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary fibrosis is a common and devastating disorder without effective pharmacological treatment options, leading to a median survival time of only 2.5 to 3.5 years after diagnosis. To complement animal research models for screening of potential therapeutics, we propose the development of a pulmonary fibrosis model using a cell-based platform that recapitulates the human lung microenvironment. The goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis through characterization of the contribution of donor fibroblasts, environmental factors, and immune and inflammatory cell mediators, then use the knowledge of mechanistic elements to aid in the discovery of new therapeutics for treating pulmonary fibrosis.",Lung-on-a-chip pulmonary fibrosis model for drug discovery,9682914,F32HL146070,"['Alveolar', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bleomycin', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Modelings', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FDA approved', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Gamma Rays', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myofibroblast', 'Organ', 'Particulate', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary alveolar structure', 'Radiation', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Stimulus', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Up-Regulation', 'base', 'chemokine', 'combinatorial', 'cytokine', 'drug discovery', 'human model', 'human tissue', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'in vitro Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'neutrophil', 'novel therapeutics', 'organ on a chip', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,34725,-0.024238493050657162
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9634985,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,313000,0.018371356040421543
"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures. These tools will be widely shared, such as through the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Network, to enhance the overall capacity of the natural products and organic chemistry communities to solve complex molecular structures.   Natural products are compounds produced by natural sources and about 50 % of FDA approved drugs can trace their origin back to natural products. This proposal aims to use our data set of natural products produced by cyanobacteria for development of analytical tools that will speed- up and stream-line the discovery and structure elucidation of new compounds.  ",Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products,9690083,R01GM107550,"['Algae', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Light', 'Marines', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'analog', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genome sequencing', 'halogenation', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'social', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,530377,0.02823747165644939
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9743120,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2019,692707,-0.016344576245200963
"Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) – comprising the endocannabinoids, their G-protein coupled re- ceptors, and their metabolic enzymes – is one of the most important physiological systems involved in estab- lishing and maintaining human health. In some illnesses, ECS dysregulation is an element of disease pathol- ogy whereas in others it is believed to be protective. Thus, there is intense interest in developing pharma- cotherapies that target the ECS to blunt its pathologies or harness its protective effects. One of the main challenges in developing new drugs that target the ECS is the problem of side effects, con- sistent with the nearly ubiquitous expression of this signaling system. Current efforts to increase the functional specificity of ECS drugs include preventing them from crossing the blood brain barrier, and targeting ancillary ECS proteins which modulate principal ECS components without being direct effectors themselves. Until now, discovery of ancillary proteins has proceeded mainly by inference from prior knowledge obtained from isolated cells. This approach can be limiting because knowledge of the underlying genetic and biochemical networks is usually incomplete. Here we propose to develop new high-throughput methodologies to enable the first unbi- ased genetic screens to identify new ECS molecules in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is an omnivorous bacterivore but it learns to prefer some species of bacteria more than others. We recently discovered that one of the worm's endocannabinoids increases the worm’s appetite for favored foods over less favored foods, a phenomenon called hedonic amplification. We propose this system as a genetically tractable model of cannabinoid effects on appetitive behavior, providing an easily screenable phenotype that directly corresponds to a well-known human behavior. The research develops two high-throughput microfluidic systems for quantifying hedonic amplification in C. ele- gans. The systems are then utilized to perform two small-scale genetic screens as a prelude to future large- scale screens. In the first, hedonic amplification will be quantified in strains in which homologs of known mam- malian ECS components have been knocked out; this screen further validates the C. elegans ECS as a mam- malian model. In the second screen, hedonic amplification will be assessed in a select set of wild isolate strains of C. elegans to estimate the heritability of this phenotype. The research is significant because it could ultimately lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to mitigate disease and promote health. Cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms involving endocannabinoids are involved in numerous physiological and psy- chological conditions including nausea, obesity, pain, anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and neu- rodegenerative disease where they can be part of the disease or the body's protective response to it. However, most attempts to harness the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid signaling have been stymied by prob- lematic side effects. The proposed research develops and applies innovative methods to screen for genes en- coding new members of the endocannabinoid signaling system as potential drug targets for treatment of endo- cannabinoid-related diseases, with fewer and milder side effects.",Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans,9650393,R21DA047645,"['Action Potentials', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cells', 'Chemotaxis', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzymes', 'Fire - disasters', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'Mutagenesis', 'Names', 'Nausea', 'Nematoda', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obesity', 'Operating System', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Organ', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'anandamide', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'endocannabinoid signaling', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'feeding', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic strain', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hedonic', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function mutation', 'marijuana use disorder', 'member', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2019,220842,0.008251791595522317
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is visible by the growth in companies and increasing deals over the past year between pharma and smaller companies using machine learning to assist in drug discovery. The continuing steady growth of structure-activity data for diverse targets, diseases and molecular properties poses a considerable challenge as they are generally not readily accessible for machine learning: content resides in a mixture of public databases (with differing levels of curation), disparate files within research groups, non- curated literature publications. In Phase I, Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed a prototype of Assay Central software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. Public data was mixed with collaborator/customer-contributed data, using original software and applied chemistry judgment of an expert team. In Phase I we created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software environment that we created readily enables the user to compile structure-activity data for building computational models and can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed. This software can in turn be used for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. We have enabled ~14 collaborative projects which have shared models on specific targets such as PyrG for Tuberculosis (identifying a lead compound), HIV reverse transcriptase, whole cell screening for Leishmaniasis as well as P450 and nuclear receptor models (e.g. estrogen receptor) relevant to toxicology. We have utilized Assay Central in our ongoing internal projects working on Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis small molecule drug discovery. In Phase II, we propose the following aims that will enable us to develop Assay Central into a production tool for enabling drug discovery collaborations which we will continue to focus on. In Phase 1 we performed a preliminary analysis of different machine learning algorithms with select drug discovery datasets. In Phase II we will now perform a thorough evaluation and selection of additional machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors as well as assessment of combination of algorithms (e.g. Bayesian and Deep Learning). We will implement disease/target definitions for machine learning models to facilitate drug discovery. We will enable molecule selection and automated design and optimization. The utility of having such a tool as Assay Central readily available will empower scientists to leverage public, private or a combination of data to help with their drug discovery tasks. Developing this software suite of computational models with public data will enable us to identify foundations, academics and potential collaborators that generate preliminary data to test models. These efforts will dramatically increase the number of projects we can work on, create new IP, and generate employment using machine learning focused on drug discovery in the area of rare and neglected diseases, in particular. Assay Central benefits include 1. Ease of deployment and use with a Java file executed by users without the need for IT support; 2. Built on industry standard technologies; 3. Graphical display of models provides instant feedback; 4 Model applicability with multiple methods to assess scores and graphics. Project Narrative In Phase I Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. have developed a prototype of ‘Assay Central’ software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. The software environment that we created readily enables us to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators and has been used successfully to find promising lead compounds for many collaborators. We now propose in Phase II to optimize the underlying machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors (e.g. combining Bayesian and Deep Learning), linking potentially thousands of rare and neglected diseases to the machine learning models, and automating molecule selection and new molecule design to enable further high value drug discovery collaborations with Assay Central.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9619615,R44GM122196,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Client', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ebola virus', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Fees', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Industry Standard', 'Intention', 'Java', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leishmaniasis', 'Licensing', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training Support', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Update', 'Vendor', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'exhaustion', 'forest', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'neglect', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'scale up', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R44,2018,694172,0.03591547234294499
"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these developing emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for “data-driven” drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. A pioneering project and dataset for D4 is the Broad Institute’s Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. Though with many successes, the Connectivity Map is based on only a single biomolecule type, RNA, and downstream effects caused by chemical perturbations to proteins and metabolites are ignored. In this proposal, we combine the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolic network modeling and metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput compound screening platform. Our preliminary data for two major drugs (doxorubicin and rapamycin) showcases that our approach has technical validity, accuracy, and provides potential biological utility that complements transcriptomics based approaches. This Phase I proposal will assess the biological utility of a metabolomics-based screening platform. First, we will profile ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes. Second, we will develop the necessary bioinformatics pipelines, mechanistic metabolic models, and machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret these complex datasets. Finally, we will assess whether adding metabolomics data to the Connectivity Map boosts D4 predictions including assessing compound mechanisms of actions, compound similarity, identifying biomarkers for drug efficacy and safety, and identifying drug repurposing opportunities. After the biological utility of this approach is demonstrated in Phase I, Phase II will focus on profiling of novel chemical and genetic perturbations to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating rare genetic diseases. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we will build a unique platform focused on the impact of human metabolism in disease. This proposal will test the viability of this approach and focus on several rare genetic diseases with significant unmet needs.",Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery,9621965,R43GM130268,"['Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doxorubicin', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'FDA approved', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'MCF7 cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmaceutical Services', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'base', 'cell growth', 'chemical genetics', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2018,442427,0.0067682511449668045
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9579149,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,314000,0.01266423122229031
"Quantifying NETosis via Automated High Content Imaging Convolutional Neural Networks PROJECT SUMMARY NETosis was identified as a distinct mode of cell death in neutrophils more than a decade ago. Dysregulation of NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of human pathologies such as preeclampsia, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, cystic fibrosis, lupus nephritis, and coagulopathies that include cancer-associated thrombosis. The literature consistently cites the lack of a standardized methodology for quantitation of NETosis as an impediment to basic and translational research. Thus, the premise is that there is a compelling, unmet need for a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis to accelerate neutrophil and inflammation-based research and facilitate the discovery and development of therapeutic compounds. The scope of this STTR project is to develop a high-throughput image analysis and quantitation method by using high content imaging and the revolutionary technology of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the identification and quantitation of NETosis in human neutrophils. The target readout is based on the primary morphological difference between NETotic and non-NETotic nuclei--the decondensation of chromatin. This image-based quantitative method will be observer-independent and will enable robust and rapid evaluation of a large number of samples that would exceed any attempts at manual assessment. In Phase I we will complete the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Optimize and standardize the high- throughput platform for quantitation of NETosis in adherent human neutrophils. This includes standard assay optimization procedures, training the CNN to identify and quantitate NETotic neutrophil, and demonstrating that the CNN reliably distinguishes between necrosis and NETosis, whose phenotypes appear similar to the human eye. Aim 2: Validate the NETosis assay biochemically and clinically. This includes concentration-response assays with NETosis agonists, assessment of NETosis inhibitors, and evaluation of the NETotic status of Sickle Cell Disease patient samples (a disease in which aberrant NETosis has been implicated). The expected outcome of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate proof-of-concept for this automated high- throughput NETosis assay. Further, we expect to provide insight into the utility of the assay for assessment of inhibitors of NETosis as therapeutic agents. Upon completion of our Phase I aims, our Phase II program will focus on further optimizing and validating this NETosis assay and preparing it for commercialization.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The lack of a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis is impeding basic and translational research. We have developed a high-throughput assay using convolutional neural networks to quantify NETosis in human neutrophils.

"Biocomputation across distributed private datasets to enhance drug discovery Project Summary Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD) proposes to develop technology that will vastly simplify and integrate all the processes required to exploit predictive models for drug discovery. The software will make it easy for scientists without specialized training in informatics to create, train, apply, evaluate, share, and archive models with minimal effort, and also leverage a large library of pre-computed models with zero effort. The software will also enable scientists working in different organizations to collectively build models from their aggregated data and share these models, without sharing the underlying training data.  Our goal is to democratize the role in drug discovery of computational models – which have historically been restricted to computational experts – and allow models to become routine aids to the discovery workflow in academia, foundations, government laboratories, and small companies that do not have the resources to employ them today. In Phase 2 we implemented modified Bayesian model building directly within CDD’s web- based CDD Vault platform, which securely hosts structure-activity relationship (SAR) data; any user can now easily train a Bayesian model with experimental data stored in her private Vault, then apply the model to predict activity for untested compounds. In Phase 2B we propose to generalize this capability with the following new Specific Aims, which are needed to achieve a widespread scientific and commercial impact: Aim 1: Integrate a suite of diverse computational techniques (such as QSAR, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, and possibly others) into a single framework, to allow direct side-by-side comparison. Aim 2: Develop and validate a universal metric that ranks the predictive strength of each method as applied to a particular dataset. Aim 3: Apply the metric to automatically generate thousands of models from high-quality, public-access structure-activity and ADME/Tox datasets and present key results to the user. Aim 4: Develop a novel capability to build models collaboratively, by aggregating multiple datasets, and share the models without revealing the compounds and data in the training sets. Project Narrative The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to accelerate the discovery of new and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Biocomputation across distributed private datasets to enhance drug discovery,9460583,R44TR000942,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Update', 'biocomputing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'forest', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model building', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2018,749018,0.03814484078048445
"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that re-purposes known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging. In this SBIR fast-track proposal we will:  PHASE I Identify a morphological profile of senescence in a variety of human cell types. Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result.

"Rules for penetrating the Gram-negative bacterial envelope The development of new antimicrobials has drastically lagged behind the fast growth of drug resistant pathogenic microbes, especially for Gram-negative (GN) bacteria. To be effective in GN bacteria, entering and staying in the cells is a challenge. Insight into the physicochemical properties that enable the entrance of compounds is critical to direct future effort in the development of effective treatment against GN pathogens. Toward this goal, we will develop methods to accurately quantify the accumulation of small molecule compounds, without requiring fluorescence or other properties for detection, and independent of their antibacterial activity. In addition, we will develop a novel computational algorithm to describe and predict physicochemical properties that favors entry and evade efflux in GN bacteria. The computer model will be validated and refined through the selection and characterization of ~1,500 of compounds. Specifically, we will pursue the following aims: Aim 1) To develop and validate LC-MS/MS based assays to quantify compound partition. We will use a panel of antibiotics as ""gold standards"" to develop and validate assays to accurately determine the accumulation of small molecule compounds in different cellular compartments. We will develop LC-MS/MS assays and experiment with the kinetics of entrance, optimizing the conditions to enable reproducible and accurate quantification. We will use a CRE strain of E. coli and a MDR strain of Acinetobacter baumannii in this study. Aim 2) To develop a computational algorithm for predicting compounds that are potentially good penetrators for GN bacteria. We will develop a new and highly accurate computational algorithm through machine learning which can systematically recognize all favorable structural factors of the compounds effective for GN bacteria. Selected compounds will be experimentally characterized in Aim 3, the knowledge from which will be incorporated back into refining the computational algorithm to generate a new round of learning/prediction. This cycle will be repeated, with the testing of ~1,500 compounds in total. Aim 3) To measure the accumulation and subcellular distribution of selected compounds and to validate rules on compound accumulation. With the assays from Aim 1, we will measure the accumulation data of compounds selected through Aim 2. Data from these analyses will be used to polish the computer model in Aim 2. Finally, the models will be evaluated through measurement of accumulation data of selected compounds and examine if the experimental data match the prediction. The knowledge gap about penetrating the cellular envelope has become the biggest hurdle to the rational design of new classes of antimicrobials against all GN pathogens. Outcome from the proposed study will help bridge the gap between a potent inhibitor and an effective antibacterial drug. The combined use of the detailed experimental assays and the new computational algorithm will empower drug discovery efforts that aim to identify promising drug candidates targeting GN bacteria.

"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9540546,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2018,58282,0.02147938845404529
"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. We will first apply this representation to build more powerful computational models that can more accurately predict properties such as bioactivity, ADME/ Tox, and pharmacokinetics across libraries of molecular structures. The ultimate goal is to leverage this repre- sentation to generate novel compounds with better combinations of properties. Both of these capabilities will help scientists to accelerate discovery of new drugs broadly across many therapeutic areas.  Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Some properties (e.g. logP) can now be modeled with such high confidence that the models have replaced the need to perform the assays, but many other critical properties (e.g. solubility, ADME, PK, hERG) remain far from this goal. We expect that our proposed chemically rich vectors will significantly advance the state of the art beyond what can be achieved with conventional descriptors and fingerprints. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  Our central innovation is a novel computational strategy: first develop a deep learning (DL) model optimized to best capture the essential structural and chemical features of molecules, starting from the most natural structural representation; then validate the DL model by applying it to improve QSAR modeling of pharmacological properties; and finally extend it to generate previously unknown molecules that have superior properties – the so-called “inverse QSAR” problem, which is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry. Others have unsuccessfully tried to leap directly to solve the inverse QSAR problem. We propose a more patient and methodical approach that will allow the neural network to perform self-supervised training to learn about chemical structures and properties from readily available, extremely large datasets, then transfer this learning to improve modeling; only after establishing this solid foundation do we intend to apply the models to attempt inverse QSAR. Prior attempts in this area have also relied on neural network architectures designed originally for language processing. We will design a new architecture, more akin to neural network architectures that have proven most successful at image classification, and optimize it to directly process the “molecular graph” that represents the relationship of atoms and bonds in molecules. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. !",Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts,9612249,R43TR002527,"['Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Solubility', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'learning strategy', 'molecular vector', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'vector', 'voice recognition']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2018,149830,0.04860498607914085
"Developing a novel platform for rapid identification of drug targets and anti-targets PROJECT SUMMARY Drugs act by altering the activities of particular components (targets) within a cell or organism. Thus, drug discovery campaigns begin by identifying a target, followed by screening this target with compounds to identify leads that can be developed into a drug. Unfortunately, identifying effective drug targets for a given disease, let alone for individual patients (e.g. in highly heterogeneous cancers) is an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone process. As a result, drugs are frequently developed against incorrect or suboptimal targets, and end up showing no clinical efficacy. Powerful genomic technologies have paved the way for much of the modern understanding of molecular biology, but they have not proven efficient at identifying drug targets. Phenotypic screening, which identifies efficacious drugs by screening compounds directly on cells, has thus regained popularity. In phenotypic screening, however, the targets are typically unknown. We are developing an innovative biotechnology platform that directly identifies effective pharmacological targets from cellular disease models by combining the two approaches, target- based and phenotypic-based screening. This is accomplished with the use of a highly annotated chemical library and sophisticated machine learning algorithms. The compounds are screened in a cell-based assay, and the phenotypic readouts are analyzed in relation to the compounds’ biochemical activities, revealing the candidate targets that are mediating the therapeutic activity of effective compounds. This approach can one day be applied at the patient level, for example using patient-derived cancer cells. We have focused our proof of concept studies on the kinase family of drug targets, and hypothesize that our platform can identify kinase dependencies in cancer cells that cannot otherwise be identified using transcriptomic and whole exome sequencing data. The aims of this Phase I application are to 1) deploy our platform to identify novel kinase targets in DLBCL Lymphoma, and 2) identify kinase inhibitors that could be used to build a compound library that optimizes the performance of the platform. Innovative features of the platform include the combination of target- and phenotypic-based screening, the machine learning algorithm that efficiently detects targets as well as anti-targets, the cell-based screening strategy which uses both tumor and normal cells to detect cancer-specific cytotoxicity, and the unique design features of the compound library. The platform will enable rapid target identification in any area of disease where a clinically relevant cell-based model exists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past two decades, the cost of developing new drugs has skyrocketed. A major culprit is the difficulty in identifying cellular components that can be engaged by drugs to produce a therapeutic effect. This proposal has two main aims: 1) The first aim is to demonstrate that by using computer algorithms to combine biochemical- and cellular- screening data, effective drug targets can be identified for two different subtypes of DLBCL lymphoma. Importantly, the method also identifies off-targets that, if disturbed, will counteract the desired outcome (i.e. lower or neutralize a drug’s efficacy). The method uses normal blood cells from healthy donors to ensure that the identified drug targets serve to specifically abolish cancer cells without harming normal cells. These key features make our method a valuable complement for currently used target identification technologies, including genomics and proteomics. 2) The second aim is to develop the core components of the methodology into a robust and standalone platform that can be used by drug discovery programs at Truvitech, its partners, and its clients. !",Developing a novel platform for rapid identification of drug targets and anti-targets,9553172,R41TR002293,"['Adult Lymphoma', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood Cells', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Client', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Normal Cell', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Promega', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cellular targeting', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic manipulation', 'genomic platform', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lead optimization', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'research and development', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCATS,"TRUVITECH, LLC",R41,2018,224804,0.03146232004553512
"Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding Project Summary/Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are poised to transform toxicological evaluation, however new approaches to enable their functional and structural profiling are needed to improve the utility of hiPSC -based models for predictive and mechanistic toxicology screening. This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays. The project deliverables benefit public health by improving the ability to rapidly identify liabilities in specific cardiomyocyte lineage types, thus reducing the time and cost to pinpoint cardiotoxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Project Narrative The assay and reagents established in the course of this project directly address the goals of significant initiatives to improve the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity testing, such as the FDA’s CiPA initiative and the work of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. The resulting improvements in the pace and precision of drug testing will result in public health benefit through the development of more cost-effective and safer medicines.

"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9486312,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,1527746,0.02183566143925107
"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9547382,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiota', 'human microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolomics', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota transplantation', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'stool sample', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,634157,0.014667961208930014
"The Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape- NeuroDevelopment (MIEL-ND) assay: a high throughput platform to screen compounds for neurodevelopmental effects Neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs – Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Intellectual Disabilities, Bipolar disorders, and Schizophrenia, etc.) are prevalent and due to errors in neurodifferentiation and neurocircuitry. While NDDs, in many cases, are due to inherited mutations, evidence is mounting that prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants also cause NDDs via disruption of epigenetics (e.g., modifications of histones [histone tags] or methylation of DNA). Our project will develop the Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape- NeuroDevelopment (MIEL-ND) assay, which will enable testing of chemicals for epigenetic effects related to NDDs. In preliminary research by Alexey Terskikh (Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute) MIEL methods were developed in which human Neural Precursor Cells (NPCs, from fetal brain) were treated with test compounds and analyzed for changes in the pattern of histone tags within the nuclei (altered “epigenetic signature” – which utilizes multiplexed immunolabeling, automated high throughput imaging, and cell-by-cell analysis using machine learning). A subset of chemicals from the US EPA ToxCast program was analyzed, and “epigenetic hits” were identified. In a separate approach, Vala Sciences Inc, which commercializes cell-based assays relevant to toxicology/drug discovery, tested EPA compounds on synapses/neurite formation in neurons developed from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-neurons), which represent human neurons in early stages of maturation. When results from the assays were compared, several epigenetic hits also altered synapse and neurite formation in the iPSC-neurons consistent with the hypothesis that epigenetic alterations may alter fate decisions of NPCs and neurodevelopment. To further develop the MIEL-ND, we propose to screen additional ToxCast compounds for effects on epigenetic and cell fate NPCs and test the compounds for effects on synapse/neurites in iPSC-neurons to develop a library of epigenetic hits with known effects on the two cell types. We will use these data and emerging data from the ToxCast program, to develop and optimize the MIEL-ND to predict NDD-inducing effects of possible environmental toxicants. The MIEL- ND will identify compounds that affect neurodevelopment that are not cytotoxic (which are missed by current assays) and represents a less expensive, higher throughput, more predictive alternative to current tests which use animals, thus reducing the use of animals in toxicity testing. Phase II goals include developing a version of the MIEL-ND featuring iPSC-NPCs (enabling use of cells derived from patients with NDDs), and adaptation of the assay to identify potential therapeutics for NDDs. Our proposed project will develop an assay to enable us to test environmental pollutants for their potential to cause neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as Autism, Intellectual Disability [retardation], Bipolar Disease [Manic Depression], and Schizophrenia. While many cases of NDDs are due to inherited mutations (the disease “runs in the family”), recent research indicates that exposure of the mother to pollution during pregnancy can cause NDDs in children that would otherwise be healthy. This is because development of the fetal brain is very sensitive to toxins. In our assay, cells representing early stages of brain development will be cultured in the laboratory and treated with compounds from the US EPA that are linked to NDDs. The cells will be photographed with robotic microscopes and the images analyzed with computers to determine which compounds may alter neurodevelopment. Currently, testing for effects on brain development of the fetus is done with animal testing. Our assay will be cheaper, more rapid, and more predictive than animal models (since it will use human cells); our assay will reduce the use of animals in toxicity research, which is a big problem, as hundreds of new compounds are developed, each year, for use in agriculture and manufacturing, and help reduce the number of people afflicted with NDDs.",The Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape- NeuroDevelopment (MIEL-ND) assay: a high throughput platform to screen compounds for neurodevelopmental effects,9623072,R41MH119621,"['Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Conceptions', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Viability', 'Fetus', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'National Toxicology Program', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Neurites', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pollution', 'Pregnancy', 'Research', 'Research Contracts', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'epigenome', 'fetal', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'microscopic imaging', 'nerve stem cell', 'neural precursor cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuron development', 'prediction algorithm', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'senescence', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIMH,"VALA SCIENCES, INC.",R41,2018,300000,0.022527464504186856
"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases.

"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9593457,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,276802,0.075634491382644
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating information about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commercial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to formalizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to become the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  CDD will first develop the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. The most innovative part of the project and the bulk of the effort will be to develop a sophisticated automated translation tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that MInChI can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxicology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicology of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9611819,R43TR002528,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anti-HIV Agents', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'data structure', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'emergency service responder', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R43,2018,149471,0.04062395054373838
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9525436,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'efficacy testing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'preclinical efficacy', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2018,541146,-0.008675916810461752
"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs.

"Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY  The authors have developed a computational platform to rapidly identify optimal drug and dose combinations from the innumerable possibilities. By testing this technique termed Phenotypic Personalized Medicine (PPM) in a diverse number of experimental systems representing different diseases, they have found that the response of biological systems to drugs can be described by a low order, smooth multidimensional surface. The main consequence of this is that optimal drug combinations can be found in a small number of tests and that translation from in vitro to in vivo and ultimately to clinical application is enabled through a re- optimization process. This input–output relationship that is always based on experimental data in lieu of predicted responses may also lead to a straightforward solution for handling human diversity in cancer therapeutics, among other diseases. In these series of studies they will test the hypothesis that PPM can be developed and validated for clinical use by using it to find novel drug combinations of repurposed/repositioned drugs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is that by the end of year 3 of this project, they will be able to initiate a clinical trial using these novel combination or combinations.  This group has previously used PPM-based optimization to find novel drug combinations in in vitro and in vivo models of cancer and infection. They have shown that this approach was able to markedly improve the efficacy of colorectal cancer therapy in vivo in mouse models. Translationally in a first-in-human clinical trial, they recently completed a prospective clinical study involving 4 PPM-dosed patients and 4 control (standard of care dosed) patients. They calculated the tacrolimus dosing regimen using the PPM process. Because PPM does not require a priori knowledge of disease mechanism and because it is a dynamic process that can accommodate a changing system, it can efficiently find personalized drug dosing over a varying range of time, having a profound stabilizing effect on the tacrolimus trough levels.  For this application, they have selected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer) to be the human disease for PPM application. The key rationale for this clinical selection is that they have a wealth of in vitro data on HCC, an active HCC tumor biorepository, and a large clinical volume of patients with HCC. These existing resources, both in vitro and clinical, allow for the immediate exploration of combination discovery followed by a clinical validation of discovered combination candidates in patients with unresectable HCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project applies a computational platform (Phenotypic Precision Medicine) to optimize combination therapy for the treatment of liver cancer. Using empiric measurements of the responses to a given treatment regimen by liver cancer cell lines and mouse models, they will demonstrate a computational approach to finding and optimizing novel drug combinations using repurposed/repositioned drugs. First they will demonstrate the ability to devise novel combination therapies and then they will start planning for a clinical trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of this approach to the treatment of liver cancer.",Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,9568854,UH2TR002087,"['BAY 54-9085', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological systems', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer treatment', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first-in-human', 'hepatocellular carcinoma cell line', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tumor']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,UH2,2018,269386,-0.005224886277943658
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9419924,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,312167,0.018371356040421543
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets. We will address these major problems with current genetic toxicity assays by developing new methods and associated commercial assay kits.",Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity,9465735,R44ES029014,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aneugens', 'Antioxidants', 'Appearance', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Bleomycin', 'Caspase', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Colcemid', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-PKcs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Epitopes', 'Etoposide', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'GADD45A gene', 'Gamma-H2AX', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'NF-kappa B', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Stains', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'clastogen', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genotoxicity', 'hazard', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'next generation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'repaired', 'response', 'targeted agent', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2018,178854,0.01875745349152537
"Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing PROJECT SUMMARY The drug development pipeline is plagued by unacceptable rates of attrition due in large part to toxicities that are not identified in pre-clinical stages of development. The ability to de-risk lead compounds during pre-clinical development with advanced “organoid-on-a-chip” technologies shows tremendous promise. Drug-induced neurotoxicity is caused by off-target effects of pharmaceuticals that lead to sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. While rarely fatal, drug-induced neurotoxicity can lead to permanent nerve damage and in some cases can be a dose-limiting side effect, leading patients to reduce dosage or stop treatment altogether. Although the peripheral nervous system bears the brunt of this neurological toxicity, development of microphysiological models of the peripheral nervous system is lagging. Towards that end, the technology described herein allows for 3D growth of high density axonal fiber tracts, resembling peripheral nerve anatomy. Progress during the prior award phase strongly demonstrated the feasibility of using microengineered neural tissues that are amenable to morphological and physiological measurements analogous to those of clinical tests. The use of structural and functional analyses should mean drug-induced neural toxicity will manifest in these measurements in ways that mimic clinical neuropathology. The goals of this proposal are to establish our human model using relevant physiological measurements in tissues fabricated from human iPS cells, and to validate the model system with a library of compounds, comparing against conventional cell culture models. Validating the peripheral nerve model system with drugs known to induce toxicity via a range of mechanisms will demonstrate the ability of the system to predict various classifications of neuropathy, yielding a high-content assay far more informative than traditional in vitro systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods available for bringing drugs to market have resulted in high attrition rates as compounds progress through the drug pipeline, resulting in unacceptable clinical trial toxicity and skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices.

"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9577958,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2018,737882,-0.016344576245200963
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9607906,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Hospitalization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,31156,0.013714296099327698
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9485464,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2018,1436141,0.05227902798736981
"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community.

Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2.

"Biocomputation across distributed private datasets to enhance drug discovery Project Summary Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD) proposes to develop technology that will vastly simplify and integrate all the processes required to exploit predictive models for drug discovery. The software will make it easy for scientists without specialized training in informatics to create, train, apply, evaluate, share, and archive models with minimal effort, and also leverage a large library of pre-computed models with zero effort. The software will also enable scientists working in different organizations to collectively build models from their aggregated data and share these models, without sharing the underlying training data.  Our goal is to democratize the role in drug discovery of computational models – which have historically been restricted to computational experts – and allow models to become routine aids to the discovery workflow in academia, foundations, government laboratories, and small companies that do not have the resources to employ them today. In Phase 2 we implemented modified Bayesian model building directly within CDD’s web- based CDD Vault platform, which securely hosts structure-activity relationship (SAR) data; any user can now easily train a Bayesian model with experimental data stored in her private Vault, then apply the model to predict activity for untested compounds. In Phase 2B we propose to generalize this capability with the following new Specific Aims, which are needed to achieve a widespread scientific and commercial impact: Aim 1: Integrate a suite of diverse computational techniques (such as QSAR, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, and possibly others) into a single framework, to allow direct side-by-side comparison. Aim 2: Develop and validate a universal metric that ranks the predictive strength of each method as applied to a particular dataset. Aim 3: Apply the metric to automatically generate thousands of models from high-quality, public-access structure-activity and ADME/Tox datasets and present key results to the user. Aim 4: Develop a novel capability to build models collaboratively, by aggregating multiple datasets, and share the models without revealing the compounds and data in the training sets. Project Narrative The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to accelerate the discovery of new and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Biocomputation across distributed private datasets to enhance drug discovery,9345057,R44TR000942,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Update', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'forest', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model building', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2017,750457,0.03814484078048445
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9353372,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota transplantation', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,650808,0.014667961208930014
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Summary The objective of ‘Assay Central’ is to compile a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties, in a form that is immediately ready for model building and other forms of analysis using cheminformatics methods. This is aided by the existence of many sources of curated open data, and one in particular, ChEMBL 1, 2 will be used as the nucleus in Phase I. This bioassay data collection is incredibly valuable, but not currently provided in a form that is ready-to-go for use by small research and development (R&D) organisations that do not have their own in-house cheminformatics teams. The effort required to preprocess, filter, merge, validate and normalize the structure and activity data requires a great deal of software expertise and medicinal chemistry domain knowledge, which are key skillsets that are rare and expensive to combine within the same team. Create a script to analyze the databases like ChEMBL, selected parts of PubChem and others 1, 2 and partition it into groups of compatible activity measurements against the same target. We will seed the dataset collection with a set of 1840 target-assay groups that have been recently extracted from the ChEMBL v20 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements 3, using methodology that we have already developed (similar to that described in 4). We will build error checking and correction software. We will apply best-of-breed methodology for checking and correcting structure-activity data 5 which errs on the side of caution for problems with non- obvious solutions, so that we can manually identify problems and either apply patches, or datasource-specific automated corrections. We will build and validate Bayesian models with the datasets collected and cleaned. For each of the target-activity groups, we will create a Bayesian model using ECFP6 or FCFP6 fingerprints, and this will be one of the primary outputs from the project. Models will be evaluated using internal and external testing with receiver operator characteristic (ROC > 0.75), the integral of the true-negative-rate – true-positive-rate curve as well as the enrichment,6 Kappa value and positive predicted value.7 We will develop new data visualization tools as a proof of concept in phase I. We have already begun to explore preliminary visualization methods using multiple models, but these have so far focused primarily on a handful of machine learning models selected from a very large list. New visualization techniques are required to summarize large matrices of data, e.g. a list of proposed structures vs. thousands of target models. In Phase II we will expand by upgrading to newer ChEMBL releases, selectively incorporating screening runs from other databases (such as PubChem 8), These tools will consist of software created explicitly for this project (particularly web-based interfaces), as well as enhanced functionality added to 3rd party tools that we influence (e.g. mobile apps) and open source projects that we have already contributed to (e.g. CDK for fingerprints and Bayesian modelling). We will widely publicise Assay Central at conferences and in papers. Being able to use transparent computational models simultaneously for visualizing activity trends for multiple targets (both diseases and ADMET) removes the burden of curation or purchasing and maintaining expensive software, and drastically simplifies the addition of new data. It also represents a new frontier of drug discovery as a world of small, agile distributed R&D organizations has access to valuable public datasets that can inform their research. Such computational models will assist in drug repurposing efforts internally and with our collaborators while likely identifying new compounds for a wide array of drug discovery projects. Narrative There are massive publically accessible databases that include a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties that are not a form that is immediately ready for machine learning model building. The ‘Assay Central’ project will compile a comprehensive collection of these datasets (from PubChem and ChEMBL) for structure-activity data. This will enable the user to quickly and automatically use machine learning models for various targets and properties. The approach will also have high value for drug repurposing efforts and identifying new compounds for targets with creation of new IP in our own research on neglected and rare diseases and in the laboratories of customers.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9254390,R43GM122196,"['Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Excretory function', 'Fingerprint', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxicology', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'absorption', 'cheminformatics', 'data visualization', 'drug discovery', 'frontier', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'model building', 'neglect', 'open data', 'open source', 'research and development', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2017,149999,0.033016889044503984
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,9401793,R01NS100531,"['Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Complement 5a', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Control Animal', 'Contusions', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Failure', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Injectable', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery of Function', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Viral Vector', 'Walking', 'axon growth', 'axon regeneration', 'behavior test', 'behavioral outcome', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injured', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'light microscopy', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,474406,0.037255511383633755
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9357736,R21TR001718,"['Africa', 'Agreement', 'Amodiaquine', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Babesia', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine resistance', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clomiphene', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ebola virus', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Female', 'Filoviridae', 'Filovirus', 'Formulation', 'Growth', 'Half-Life', 'Hour', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred BALB C Mice', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Mannich Bases', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Natural Products', 'New England', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Research Institute', 'Route', 'Solubility', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Toremifene', 'Toxic effect', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Whole Blood', 'analog', 'artemether', 'artesunate', 'base', 'benflumetol', 'clinical candidate', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxicity', 'nonhuman primate', 'patient population', 'pharmacophore', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'pyronaridine', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'treatment duration']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2017,312390,0.04726195736226144
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9262478,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,348188,0.03730181952766111
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9333447,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2017,544581,-0.008675916810461752
"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs.

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools.

"Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY  The authors have developed a computational platform to rapidly identify optimal drug and dose combinations from the innumerable possibilities. By testing this technique termed Phenotypic Personalized Medicine (PPM) in a diverse number of experimental systems representing different diseases, they have found that the response of biological systems to drugs can be described by a low order, smooth multidimensional surface. The main consequence of this is that optimal drug combinations can be found in a small number of tests and that translation from in vitro to in vivo and ultimately to clinical application is enabled through a re- optimization process. This input–output relationship that is always based on experimental data in lieu of predicted responses may also lead to a straightforward solution for handling human diversity in cancer therapeutics, among other diseases. In these series of studies they will test the hypothesis that PPM can be developed and validated for clinical use by using it to find novel drug combinations of repurposed/repositioned drugs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is that by the end of year 3 of this project, they will be able to initiate a clinical trial using these novel combination or combinations.  This group has previously used PPM-based optimization to find novel drug combinations in in vitro and in vivo models of cancer and infection. They have shown that this approach was able to markedly improve the efficacy of colorectal cancer therapy in vivo in mouse models. Translationally in a first-in-human clinical trial, they recently completed a prospective clinical study involving 4 PPM-dosed patients and 4 control (standard of care dosed) patients. They calculated the tacrolimus dosing regimen using the PPM process. Because PPM does not require a priori knowledge of disease mechanism and because it is a dynamic process that can accommodate a changing system, it can efficiently find personalized drug dosing over a varying range of time, having a profound stabilizing effect on the tacrolimus trough levels.  For this application, they have selected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer) to be the human disease for PPM application. The key rationale for this clinical selection is that they have a wealth of in vitro data on HCC, an active HCC tumor biorepository, and a large clinical volume of patients with HCC. These existing resources, both in vitro and clinical, allow for the immediate exploration of combination discovery followed by a clinical validation of discovered combination candidates in patients with unresectable HCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project applies a computational platform (Phenotypic Precision Medicine) to optimize combination therapy for the treatment of liver cancer. Using empiric measurements of the responses to a given treatment regimen by liver cancer cell lines and mouse models, they will demonstrate a computational approach to finding and optimizing novel drug combinations using repurposed/repositioned drugs. First they will demonstrate the ability to devise novel combination therapies and then they will start planning for a clinical trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of this approach to the treatment of liver cancer.",Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,9386682,UH2TR002087,"['BAY 54-9085', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological systems', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'hepatocellular carcinoma cell line', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tumor']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,UH2,2017,286725,-0.005224886277943658
"High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxicity accounts for approximately 20% of drug attrition, of which nearly one third is attributed to cardiovascular issues, in particular arrhythmias.1 The cost of bringing a new drug to market can exceed $1.2 billion and require more than 10 years of research. Thus, it is critical to identify cardiotoxicity early in developmen. Current in vitro screening assays for pro-­‐arrhythmic drug effects focus on measuring inhibition of the hERG potassium channel, which has been linked to potentially lethal Torsades de Pointes arrhythmias (TdP).2 The hERG assay, however, lacks high sensitivity and specificity: not all QT prolongation is due to block of hERG alone and not all hERG blockers result in QT prolongation or induce TdP. To address these limitations, regulatory bodies have created the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative2, which proposes use of cardiomyocytes derived from human stem cells as an in vitro model for arrhythmogenic drug potential. Establishment of this model for toxicity screening requires detailed characterization of the cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) and calcium transient (CT), the response of APs/CTs to drugs, and the correlation to clinical outcomes in humans. High-­‐throughput tools needed for performing these measurements, however, have been lacking. Here we propose to develop a high-­‐throughput, all-­‐optical electrophysiology platform for cardiotoxicity screening in sem cell-­‐derived cardiomyocytes. With our Phase I award, we demonstrated that the Optopatch platform could be used to detect changes in the electrophysiological characteristics of human derived CMs following both acute and chronic drug treatment, albeit with the throughput of a single well per recording. To highly parallelize these measurements, we propose building a 96-­‐well plate Optopatch instrument for simultaneous recording of voltage and calcium waveforms under paced conditions from 24 wells. This geometry will provide nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in throughput of our assay. Optopatch constructs will be optimized to allow for incorporation of the actuator and reporter proteins in each cell. We will utilize this platform to screen 50 compounds with known risk scores for Torsades de Pointes in different sources of human cardiomyocytes and use this data to develop a predictive algorithm of arrhythmogenicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Q­‐State's technology will allow better prediction of a drug candidate's potential adverse effects to the human heart than the assays mandated by the current cardiac safety guidance ICH S7B.   It will contribute to bringing effective healthcare solutions to market at lower cost and higher productivity, by preventing drugs with cardiotoxicity from reaching the market and preventing the development of valuable therapeutics from being wrongly terminated, which is one of the concerns about the current S7B assays. Making Q-­‐State instrumentation and reagents available to the academic research community will facilitate better mechanistic studies and therapeutics development to benefit patients with cardiac conditions.","High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity.",9247825,R44HL126314,"['Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Blinded', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Ecology', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phototoxicity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potassium Channel', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Torsades de Pointes', 'Toxic effect', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'human stem cells', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'phase 1 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell biology', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHLBI,"Q-STATE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2017,369580,0.008105283879397535
"Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing PROJECT SUMMARY The drug development pipeline is plagued by unacceptable rates of attrition due in large part to toxicities that are not identified in pre-clinical stages of development. The ability to de-risk lead compounds during pre-clinical development with advanced “organoid-on-a-chip” technologies shows tremendous promise. Drug-induced neurotoxicity is caused by off-target effects of pharmaceuticals that lead to sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. While rarely fatal, drug-induced neurotoxicity can lead to permanent nerve damage and in some cases can be a dose-limiting side effect, leading patients to reduce dosage or stop treatment altogether. Although the peripheral nervous system bears the brunt of this neurological toxicity, development of microphysiological models of the peripheral nervous system is lagging. Towards that end, the technology described herein allows for 3D growth of high density axonal fiber tracts, resembling peripheral nerve anatomy. Progress during the prior award phase strongly demonstrated the feasibility of using microengineered neural tissues that are amenable to morphological and physiological measurements analogous to those of clinical tests. The use of structural and functional analyses should mean drug-induced neural toxicity will manifest in these measurements in ways that mimic clinical neuropathology. The goals of this proposal are to establish our human model using relevant physiological measurements in tissues fabricated from human iPS cells, and to validate the model system with a library of compounds, comparing against conventional cell culture models. Validating the peripheral nerve model system with drugs known to induce toxicity via a range of mechanisms will demonstrate the ability of the system to predict various classifications of neuropathy, yielding a high-content assay far more informative than traditional in vitro systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods available for bringing drugs to market have resulted in high attrition rates as compounds progress through the drug pipeline, resulting in unacceptable clinical trial toxicity and skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices. Improving the predictive power of preclinical models represents the fastest and most competitive method to advance the safety and time to market for new therapeutics. As an added benefit, decreased drug development costs should also expand the availability of novel treatment options for patients.",Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing,9410154,R42TR001270,"['Action Potentials', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neural Conduction', 'Neurites', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Preparation', 'Price', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Speed', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'axon growth', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'density', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'expectation', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'motor deficit', 'neuropathology', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical development', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response']",NCATS,"AXOSIM, INC.",R42,2017,963541,0.017603614081877224
"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9235506,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,309750,0.018371356040421543
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs. In order to address the unmet medical needs of an aging population, novel therapeutics must be developed, and this will require much more creativity in the design process.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9136115,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,662793,0.014667961208930014
"Discovery of LXR Agonists via Pharmacophore Space Mining The goal of this proposal is to discover drug-like liver X receptor (LXR) β selective agonists that can halt and reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent work demonstrated that activation of the LXR signaling pathways leads to improved amyloid β (Aβ) turnover, reduction in Aβ plaque area, and the reversal of cognitive, social and olfactory deficits. The research plan consists of two steps. The first step is computer-aided prediction of agonistic LXRβ selective binding, blood brain barrier permeability, and absence of side effects such as mutagenicity or binding to undesired targets. This step relies on a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the joint space of chemical compounds, targets, and chemical/biological properties. This joint space is defined using machine learning on the 3D geometry of spatial arrangement of pharmacophoric points, using attributes such as donors, acceptors, aromatic rings, and charged fragments. The second step consists of biological assays to assess toxicity, brain penetration potential and the ability to induce expression of the corresponding genes. A dozen diverse compounds will have been tested through two iterations of the two steps of in silico prediction and assays at the end of Phase 1. These initial leads will be augmented with additional de novo compounds and further scrutinized via behavioral assays, dose-response studies and more detailed, sophisticated, and mechanistic assays during Phase 2. The outcome of this study will be new drug leads to potentially treat and prevent AD at different stages of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Interleaving of computer-aided screening of large chemical databases through novel machine learning based models with biological assays will identify drug-like LXRβ selective agonists with minimal side-effects. These agonists will slow and reverse Alzheimer’s Disease.",Discovery of LXR Agonists via Pharmacophore Space Mining,9202941,R43AG054350,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Joints', 'LXRalpha protein', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Liver X Receptor', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'PPAR gamma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Research', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'lipid metabolism', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pharmacophore', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'social']",NIA,"ACELOT, INC.",R43,2016,223325,-0.010121291730291583
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9204673,R21TR001718,"['Africa', 'Agreement', 'Amodiaquine', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Babesia', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine resistance', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clomiphene', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ebola virus', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Female', 'Filovirus', 'Formulation', 'Growth', 'Half-Life', 'Hour', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Mannich Bases', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Natural Product Drug', 'New England', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Research Institute', 'Route', 'Solubility', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Toremifene', 'Toxic effect', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Whole Blood', 'analog', 'artemether', 'artesunate', 'base', 'benflumetol', 'bioactive natural products', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxicity', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'pharmacophore', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'pyronaridine', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'treatment duration']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2016,288801,0.04726195736226144
"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that re-purposes known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging. In this SBIR fast-track proposal we will:  PHASE I Identify a morphological profile of senescence in a variety of human cell types. Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic diseases of aging affect a significant proportion of Americans. Cellular senescence, a useful biological program which prevents replication of cells exposed to various stresses that may be at risk of initiating tumors, has long-term deleterious inflammatory effects.

"Optimization of small molecule triazine antituberculars for in vivo efficacy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is due to infection with the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This disease represents a global health pandemic as based on WHO statistics it claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year, while infecting nearly 9 million. New drugs are urgently needed with novel mechanisms of action that treat this disease while also addressing an important need to reduce the lengthy course of treatment that is at best 6 months in duration. We have a primary goal of discovering novel classes of antibacterials. (E)-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)-N2,N4-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2019) [1], was rediscovered by us using Bayesian machine learning models in 2013. It represents a class of antitubercular agents reported only once in 1969 [2]. While JSF-2019 did not exhibit in vivo efficacy in an acute model in our hands, a close analog, ((E)-N2,N4-diisopropyl-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2032) [2] was reported in 1969 to exhibit in vivo activity. Our preliminary data on solubility in PBS, mouse liver microsomal stability, Caco-2 cell permeability, and mouse snapshot pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles demonstrate that the diaminotriazine class of antituberculars holds significant promise for seeding a novel therapeutic. We aim to further improve upon the in vitro efficacy, in vitro Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of these early compounds. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: Utilize medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models to optimize the initial triazine hit family as antitubercular agents. Apply transcriptional profiling nd resistant mutant/whole-genome sequencing methods to identify potential drug targets and mechanism of action of the triazine antitubercular class. Phase I would, therefore, seek to deliver an in vivo active small molecule triazine with information as to potential target/s through complimentary methods. A Phase II program would leverage this information to further optimize this series towards a preclinical candidate of significant interest to foundations and/or biotech/pharmaceutical companies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis represents a global health pandemic, which claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year. Starting from a series of triazines active compounds we will optimize ADME properties to afford a novel in vivo active lead compound by combining our unique expertise in medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models. We will also probe the potential target/s of the triazine series.

"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9150339,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,547736,-0.008675916810461752
"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets.

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries. The ultimate goal of this project is to arrive at a small number of candidate molecules with high predicted binding affinity to their biological targets, which will be tested in confirmatory experiments.        ",Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening,8858750,R01GM114015,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Enzymes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Orphan', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Planning Techniques', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Side', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized tools', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'research study', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'sperm cell', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,293344,0.013371425532405478
"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxicity accounts for approximately 20% of drug attrition, of which nearly one third is attributed to cardiovascular issues, in particular arrhythmias.1 The cost of bringing a new drug to market can exceed $1.2 billion and require more than 10 years of research. Thus, it is critical to identify cardiotoxicity early in developmen. Current in vitro screening assays for pro-­‐arrhythmic drug effects focus on measuring inhibition of the hERG potassium channel, which has been linked to potentially lethal Torsades de Pointes arrhythmias (TdP).2 The hERG assay, however, lacks high sensitivity and specificity: not all QT prolongation is due to block of hERG alone and not all hERG blockers result in QT prolongation or induce TdP. To address these limitations, regulatory bodies have created the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative2, which proposes use of cardiomyocytes derived from human stem cells as an in vitro model for arrhythmogenic drug potential. Establishment of this model for toxicity screening requires detailed characterization of the cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) and calcium transient (CT), the response of APs/CTs to drugs, and the correlation to clinical outcomes in humans. High-­‐throughput tools needed for performing these measurements, however, have been lacking. Here we propose to develop a high-­‐throughput, all-­‐optical electrophysiology platform for cardiotoxicity screening in sem cell-­‐derived cardiomyocytes. With our Phase I award, we demonstrated that the Optopatch platform could be used to detect changes in the electrophysiological characteristics of human derived CMs following both acute and chronic drug treatment, albeit with the throughput of a single well per recording. To highly parallelize these measurements, we propose building a 96-­‐well plate Optopatch instrument for simultaneous recording of voltage and calcium waveforms under paced conditions from 24 wells. This geometry will provide nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in throughput of our assay. Optopatch constructs will be optimized to allow for incorporation of the actuator and reporter proteins in each cell. We will utilize this platform to screen 50 compounds with known risk scores for Torsades de Pointes in different sources of human cardiomyocytes and use this data to develop a predictive algorithm of arrhythmogenicity.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Q­‐State's technology will allow better prediction of a drug candidate's potential adverse effects to the human heart than the assays mandated by the current cardiac safety guidance ICH S7B.   It will contribute to bringing effective healthcare solutions to market at lower cost and higher productivity, by preventing drugs with cardiotoxicity from reaching the market and preventing the development of valuable therapeutics from being wrongly terminated, which is one of the concerns about the current S7B assays. Making Q-­‐State instrumentation and reagents available to the academic research community will facilitate better mechanistic studies and therapeutics development to benefit patients with cardiac conditions.               ","High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity.",9138354,R44HL126314,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Blinded', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Health', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phototoxicity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potassium Channel', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Software Engineering', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Torsades de Pointes', 'Toxic effect', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'human stem cells', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'phase 1 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell biology', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHLBI,"Q-STATE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2016,602645,0.008105283879397535
"Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite major advances in the subject of marijuana and cannabinoid (CB) research, there are only a few CB ligands currently available as FDA-approved drugs, partly because of the absence of experimental structures of CB receptors and a lack of knowledge of the conformational dynamics of the receptors, as well as a limited knowledge of the ligand-binding (orthosteric or allosteric) sites within the CB receptors. Very few allosteric modulators have been identified for CB receptors. There is great potential for discovery of novel CB ligands targeting either orthosteric or allosteric CB1 or CB2 receptor sites. Activators or inhibitors of these receptors are being investigated as therapeutic agents for many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. In this project, computational modeling of human CB1 and CB2 ligands, receptors, and receptor-ligand interactions will be carried out. We are interested in discovering orthosteric agonists selective for CB2 over CB1, peripherally- restricted antagonists, as well as allosteric CB modulators, all of which may be able to provide efficacy without causing negative psychotropic effects. Systematic, computationally-intensive research will yield novel active hit CB receptor modulators, which can later be developed into lead drug candidates. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To model, train and validate various ligand-based mathematical models to predict and classify CB ligands as agonists or antagonists. Literature- reported CB ligands and activity data as well as experimental data obtained for proprietary molecules being tested at the University of Mississippi, School of Pharmacy will be curated. Ligand-based models will be constructed, trained and validated. Aim 2. To construct, validate and simulate computational models of the CB1 and CB2 receptors in their active and inactive states. Receptor models will be developed, some that are tailored for agonists (active state) and some for antagonists or inverse agonists (basal or inactive states), utilizing structural information from multiple homologous GPCR templates. Aim 3. To apply integrated ligand-based and receptor-based virtual screening (VS) protocols to discover orthosteric and allosteric CB modulators. Validated models from Aims 1 and 2 will be used strategically in VS protocols to discover novel orthosteric and allosteric CB ligand chemotypes. We will screen repositories of small molecules including MarinLit, ZINC, and that of the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR) and virtual libraries generated using computational tools to access extended chemical space. Top- ranked VS hits will be procured, purified if necessary, and characterized to confirm their structures. Aim 4. To conduct in vitro testing in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays. Potential hit compounds from Aim 3 will be tested in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays in the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy NIH COBRE-supported In Vitro Research Core.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through computational modeling of the requirements for modulating the cannabinoid (CB) receptor subtypes, CB1 and CB2, which are class-A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), we intend to discover molecules which act through the CB receptors and that could later be developed into new drugs to treat many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.            ",Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators,9099196,R15GM119061,"['Academia', 'Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CNR1 gene', 'CNR2 gene', 'Cannabidiol', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cannabis', 'Cannabis sativa plant', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Data', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Government', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutagenesis', 'Natural Products', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Organism', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy Schools', 'Plants', 'Publishing', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Virtual Library', 'base', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical model', 'nanomolar', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'painful neuropathy', 'pharmacophore', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'repository', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI,R15,2016,427379,0.015796472947201236
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,9144793,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2016,66564,0.026697425085142786
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs. In order to address the unmet medical needs of an aging population, novel therapeutics must be developed, and this will require much more creativity in the design process. The proposed research will develop a predictive computational framework to aid in active design of structurally novel drug molecules during the drug discovery lead optimization process.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,8786087,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'blind', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer framework', 'design', 'design and construction', 'drug discovery', 'falls', 'interest', 'model building', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'receptor binding', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,300675,0.012150060839543649
"High Content Sceening for Hereditary Stroke Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) is a hereditary stroke syndrome that has no treatment other than neurosurgery. Loss of one of three genes causes CCM.

We will use a chemical suppression screen in cell culture systems to discover small molecules that rescue these distinct phenotypes. Our high-throughput platform consists of two primary screens: the first is an imaging screen with machine-learning based phenotype analysis; the second screen uses electric cell substrate impedance sensing to detect changes in endothelial barrier function. We will then further screen the top candidate compounds in a mouse model of human CCM disease.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,8928177,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'Cresols', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,673919,0.014667961208930014

"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The computational biologists, physician-scientists and pharmacologists in the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology will apply a combined measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. They will develop and apply new tools to (i) investigate the factors that determine the therapeutic index of drugs at a single cell level and in tissues (ii) apply knowledge of cellulr networks to develop a rational approach to combination therapy (iii) identify and qualify new drug targets for significant unmet medical needs.

"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9037783,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,572285,-0.008675916810461752
"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.

"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.            ",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,8953935,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2015,66904,0.026697425085142786

Pulse is the first beating assay designed to be fully compatible with common cell culture practices, completely non-invasive to cells, and cost- effective, making it ideal for large-scale cardiovascular drug development and cardiotoxicity testing. In addition, Pulse accommodates any type of cell plating by automatically recognizing distinct beating regions, enabling new types of high-throughput single-cell studies. Cardiac safety is an important problem facing the pharmaceutical industry, and accounts for nearly 40% of the withdrawal of FDA-approved drugs from the market. The concerns over cardiac safety are further complicated by the extremely high costs of new drug development and the low success rates of late-stage clinical trials. There is therefore a significant need for better tools to predict cardiotoxicity during the preclinical stages of drug development. Such tools would have a significant impact on human health and the U.S. economy by developing safer drugs and reducing costs related to drug failures. Patch clamp assays are the current standard reference for high-precision electrical measurements of single cardiomyocytes. However, they require manual setup by a trained expert. Such assays are inherently a low-throughput technology that will not scale to meet the demand of large-scale drug testing. One alternative, imaging of calcium signaling, is useful as a reference, but limited by potential interactions with other compounds. We believe that a contact-free, label-free imaging technique is not only a viable alternative, but also a technology that will enable cost effective high-throughput analysis in a completely automated fashion. Such automated and non-invasive assays can be used more routinely for drug development, and ultimately for patient specific studies. Over the past year, we have successfully completed the initial development phase and demonstrated the feasibility of our Pulse technology platform. In this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR proposal, we seek funding to support and accelerate the development of the Pulse product. Our goal is to continue to innovate and optimize the Pulse product so it may become the standard 'go-to' assay for cardiomyocyte-based drug screening and toxicity testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes hold tremendous potential for drug development and safety testing related to cardiovascular health. In this Direct-to-Phase 2 SBIR proposal, we seek to commercialize a novel platform (called PulseTM) for label-free, contact-free characterization of cardiomyocytes using video microscopy and state-of-the-art computer vision analysis. Pulse is the first beating assay designed to be high-throughput, fully compatible with common cell culture practices, and completely non-invasive to cells, making it ideal for cardiovascular drug development and cardiotoxicity testing.                ",A Novel System for Non-Invasive Characterization of Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes,8831991,R44HL126277,"['Accounting', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug toxicity', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Label', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Motion', 'Nodal', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preclinical Drug Development', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reference Standards', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Video Microscopy', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'axion', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular health', 'cell type', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug market', 'drug testing', 'electrical measurement', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'non-invasive system', 'novel', 'patch clamp', 'post-market', 'pre-clinical', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'stem cell technology', 'success', 'theranostics', 'tool', 'web site']",NHLBI,"CELLOGY, INC.",R44,2015,936000,-0.011344127467348622
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs. In order to address the unmet medical needs of an aging population, novel therapeutics must be developed, and this will require much more creativity in the design process. The proposed research will develop a predictive computational framework to aid in active design of structurally novel drug molecules during the drug discovery lead optimization process.            ",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,8598096,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'blind', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer framework', 'design', 'design and construction', 'drug discovery', 'falls', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,299250,0.012150060839543649
"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.          Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING DESCRIPTION  Abstract:  We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique  for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional  structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective  in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates  computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess  for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption,  distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways.  The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be iteratively  refined using machine learning techniques.  We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight  human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is  the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against  these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community.  In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified  their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of  the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus  far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies.  The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted  lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.  The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any  disease, thereby increasing the success rate and reducing the risk, cost, and time associated with traditional  drug discovery methods. This Pioneer award application will focus on the creation and improvement of computational methods to  develop broad spectrum therapeutics against any infectious or inherited disease. Pathogens of focus include  all human herpes viruses (HHVs), which infect billions worldwide every year, with a significant mortality rate in  immunocompromised patients; yet limited therapeutics exist for many of these viruses and virus populations  are becoming resistant to current drugs.

"High Content Sceening for Hereditary Stroke Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) is a hereditary stroke syndrome that has no treatment other than neurosurgery. Loss of one of three genes causes CCM. By reducing the expression of one of these genes (CCM2) in the cells that line blood vessels (endothelial cells), unique structural and functional phenotypes result. We will use a chemical suppression screen in cell culture systems to discover small molecules that rescue these distinct phenotypes. Our high-throughput platform consists of two primary screens: the first is an imaging screen with machine-learning based phenotype analysis; the second screen uses electric cell substrate impedance sensing to detect changes in endothelial barrier function. We will then further screen the top candidate compounds in a mouse model of human CCM disease. The result of this project will be personalized medicine candidates for the treatment of CCM caused by mutations in the CCM2 gene.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.            ",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,8817197,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'Cresols', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,727558,0.014667961208930014
"The HMS Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY  Systems and computational biologists, physician-scientists, pharmacologists, biochemists and cell biologists will collaborate in a new Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) to apply a measure-model approach to understanding the mechanisms of action of therapeutic drugs in multiple disease areas. The LSP will pioneer the development of quantitative network-centric approaches to pharmacology and toxicology that include analysis of dose-time-response relationships at a single-cell level, modeling of cellular network dynamics and their perturbation by drugs, development of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models in mouse and ultimately in man and use of systematic approaches to identify and qualify new drug targets. Our approach combines mathematical modeling with empirical measurement (including work with clinical samples and data) and aims to create quantitative and predictive drug response models at different temporal and physical scales. We aim to reinvigorate pharmacology and toxicology as foundational disciplines of translational medicine, develop the conceptual underpinning for personalized and precision medicine and lower the cost of drug discovery by improving its predictability. Close interactions with industry and the FDA will help address the productivity gap in drug discovery and development. The LSP is innovative with respect to its goal of using problems in basic and translational pharmacology to link three disciplines (cell and molecular biology, computational biology and medicine) and its aim of advancing therapeutic science in the Boston area and beyond. Students and postdocs supervised by 18 faculty members, 2 independent postdoctoral fellows and two PhD-level staff from 7 institutions will work in immediate proximity in a new custom-designed laboratory. The lab will host a new graduate program in therapeutics and multi-factored outreach activities that will promote systems pharmacology internationally.  These goals will be achieved through four inter-linked research programs (Aims 1-4), a core dedicated to efficient translation of LSP research (Aim 5), an education core and administrative/outreach activities (Aims 6-8). Aim 1 will focus on the determinants of dose-response at a single-cell level, including the role of cell-to-cell variability in fractional response and of timing and order-of-exposure in combination therapy. Aim 2 will take a network-level approach to understanding therapeutic, toxic and paradoxical drug responses by kinase inhibitors in three types of cancer. The mechanistic basis and consequences of poly-pharmacology will also be examined along with differential drug responsiveness by normal and diseased tissues. Aim 3 will address PK-PD by developing multi-scale models of drug actions at the level of cells, tissues and organisms and new methods for measuring drug distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Aim 4 will apply machine learning and causal reasoning to target discovery from clinical records in asthma, inflammatory disease and fibrosis and pursue a structure-guided approach to identifying regulators of ""undruggable "" targets.

"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal will explore obesity treatment strategies using small molecule allosteric modulators as probes of Y receptors.            ",Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors,8694027,R01DK097376,"['Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Arrestins', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain Stem', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chemosensitization', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cone', 'Consultations', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Histamine Receptor', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Obesity', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Polypeptide', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Play', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'interest', 'member', 'neuropeptide Y', 'neuropeptide Y4 receptor', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'peptide hormone', 'polypeptide', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic development', 'tissue-factor-pathway inhibitor 2', 'treatment strategy', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,339519,0.045452054920658035
"Novel Paradigms For Drug Discovery: Computational Multitarget Screening DESCRIPTION  Abstract:  We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique  for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional  structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective  in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates  computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess  for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption,  distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways.  The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be iteratively  refined using machine learning techniques.  We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight  human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is  the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against  these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community.  In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified  their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of  the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus  far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies.  The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted  lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.  The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any  disease, thereby increasing the success rate and reducing the risk, cost, and time associated with traditional  drug discovery methods. This Pioneer award application will focus on the creation and improvement of computational methods to  develop broad spectrum therapeutics against any infectious or inherited disease.

"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs. In order to address the unmet medical needs of an aging population, novel therapeutics must be developed, and this will require much more creativity in the design process. The proposed research will develop a predictive computational framework to aid in active design of structurally novel drug molecules during the drug discovery lead optimization process.            ",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,8436505,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'blind', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer framework', 'design', 'design and construction', 'drug discovery', 'falls', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2013,291402,0.012150060839543649
"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.          Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Nanobiology and Predictive Toxicology has assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nanomaterial science, toxicology, cell biology, high throughput screening, biostatistics, mathematics and computer science with the overall goal of gaining fundamental understanding of how the physical and Chemical properties of carefully selected ENM libraries relate to interactions with cells and cellular structures, including how these bio-physicochemical interactions at the nano-bio interface may lead to pulmonary toxicity. This goal will be executed through the acquisition, synthesis and characterization of compositional and combinatorial ENM libraries that focus on the major physicochemical properties of nominated metal, metal oxide and silica nanoparticles {Scientific Core), hypothesized to play a role in pulmonary toxicity through the generation of oxidative stress, inflammation, signal pathway activation and membrane lysis. These efforts will be assisted by in silico modeling that use heatmaps, mathematical models and machine learning to perform hazard ranking and risk prediction. The major objectives of the Center are: (i) To establish an overarching predictive toxicological paradigm, which is defined as the assessment of in vivo toxic potential of ENM based on in vitro and in silico methods (integrated center effort); (ii) To establish rapid throughput cellular screening and conduct imaging to identify compositional and combinatorial ENM properties that lead to bioavailability and engagement of the injury pathways discussed above (Project 1); (iii) To establish through the performance of instillation and inhalation exposures in the rodent lung how the structure-property relationships linking ENM to in vitro injury mechanisms may be predictive of pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion (Project 2); (iv) To develop in silico toxicity models that utilize multivariate analysis of the rapid throughput screening and cellular imaging data to show the relationships that can be used to develop ""nano-QSARs"" for probabilistic risk ranking (Project 3).        We propose a center to study how properties of engineered nanomaterials may lead to lung health effects by creating harmful interactions in cells and tissues that will come into contact with these materials.

"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal will explore obesity treatment strategies using small molecule allosteric modulators as probes of Y receptors.            ",Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors,8578312,R01DK097376,"['Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Arrestins', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain Stem', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chemosensitization', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Histamine Receptor', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Obesity', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Polypeptide', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Play', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Retinal Cone', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'interest', 'member', 'neuropeptide Y', 'neuropeptide Y4 receptor', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'peptide hormone', 'polypeptide', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic development', 'tissue-factor-pathway inhibitor 2', 'treatment strategy', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,352032,0.045452054920658035

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia. In silico hit compounds will be experimentally validated and enter hit-to-lead optimization.

"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.              Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Discovery of A-beta Oligomer Antagonists via 3D Pharmacophore Space Analysis The goal of this proposal is to discover drug-like retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists that can halt and reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The research strategy is to target ApoE gene expression through RXR agonists; this has recently been shown to improve A¿ turnover, reduction in A¿ plaque area, and the reversal of cognitive, social and olfactory deficits. The research plan consists of two steps. The first step is computer-aided prediction of agonistic RXR binding, blood brain barrier permeability, and absence of side effects. This step relies on a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the joint space of chemical compounds, targets, and chemical/biological properties. This joint space is defined using machine learning on the 3D geometry of spatial arrangement of pharmacophoric points, using attributes such as donors, acceptors, aromatic rings, and charged fragments. The second step consists of biochemical assays including competitive binding with bexarotene, and ApoE level determination in cultured mouse brain cells. A small number of drug-like compounds will be obtained through multiple iterations of the two steps of in-silico prediction and assays at the end of Phase 1.

"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1).

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use. The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any disease, thereby increasing the suc       n/a",NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING,7979181,DP1OD006779,"['Adverse effects', 'Area', 'Award', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Dengue', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Excretory function', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'absorption', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP1,2010,830000,0.04529941048076802

"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS). By so doing, the rate of discovery of drugs to treat this global tropical disease will be increased.           Project Narrative The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS).

The time required to bring a new drug into the market has not decreased, though the cost for drug discovery is steadily increasing. The root causes of this problem are related to efficacy, toxicity, and inappropriate absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, as shown by recent rigorous analyses. To focus on the ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) issues, pharmaceutical research groups have, since the late 1990s, moved various physicochemical property screens earlier in the drug discovery process. The metabolic transformations of pharmaceuticals profoundly impact their bioavailability, efficacy, chronic toxicity, metabolic idiosyncrasies, excretion rates and routes. Metabolism is one of the major hurdles to overcome. In silico tools enable fast and virtual screening of large numbers of compounds before compounds are synthesized. Such tools enable researchers to recognize complicated metabolic processes, to eliminate poor candidates, and then to use the knowledge gained to discern possible deficiencies in compounds. Still poorly understood, metabolism is the most difficult to predict. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a system to predict xenobiotic metabolism in mammals, and to gain insights into metabolism mechanisms (aim 1), and to study the differences in metabolism between humans and model animals (aim 2). We will use MDL's Metabolite database as a source of information about drug metabolism reactions. For aim 1, we will develop both global metabolism prediction systems, which can be applied to diverse substrate without prior knowledge of enzymes, and local models for particular enzymes, when prior knowledge of the enzymes involved in reactions is available. Global metabolism prediction systems will comprise many individual models, each of which will focus on an animal species (e.g., humans), an enzyme (e.g., CYP3A4) and a specific biotransformation (e.g., hydroxylation). Machine learning techniques will be used to build each individual model using various features to characterize the chemical environments of functional groups within molecules. For local models for an enzyme, we assume that the tight binding of ligands and enzymes is not required, but rather that reactions occur at sites where enzymes can easily attack. We will design ways to model the probability that a particular site will be attacked by enzymes. In Aim 1, both the global metabolism prediction system and the local models are trained on human reactions, so the models are animal specific. In Aim 2, we will build models for rat, which is a model animal in drug development. Using rat reactions listed in MDL's Metabolite database, we will establish a global metabolism system for rats and local models for rats using the same methods outlined in Aim 1. Though the methods are the same, the training sets are different, and it is expected that the models will make different predictions. By using drugs that are known to be metabolized differently in humans and rats, we will study differences in the human and rat models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In pursuit of novel therapeutics, drug developers are scanning more compounds and covering more chemical space than ever before. ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) has assumed center stage in the drug discovery process. Predicting metabolism is one of the major challenges to be met, and metabolism is the most poorly understood of the ADMET processes, and the most difficult to predict.

"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target protein. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      The PI of the proposal has extensive experience in the usage of ANNs and SVMs to predict properties of organic molecules and proteins (1-9), solve protein structures (10-15), and predict activity of therapeutics (16).

"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).

This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips.

"Technology to Identify and Assay Chemical Genomic Probes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and deploy cutting edge technologies and chemical genomic tools and to understand the effects of small molecule inhibitors in vivo, and to characterize the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae on a systems level. Over the course of the past 3.5 years, as part of an NHGRI-funded project, we have applied three unique genome-wide screens to ~2,000 chemical inhibitors of growth. These data have led to several notable findings, including: 1) novel drug/target interactions, 2) a chemical phenotype for nearly all yeast genes, 3) a systems-level characterization of yeast, and 4) a better understanding of chemical structure-activity relationships as they manifest in vivo. These data have also guided the design of the next-generation chemical genomic assays proposed herein. Using our established bioinformatics and robotics infrastructure, we will design the next generation of assays to interrogate the genome's interaction with small molecules to unprecedented levels of scrutiny, while decreasing cost per chemical. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Small molecules, the central focus of this proposal, make up the majority of FDA approved drugs. Unfortunately, the pharmaceutical industry is currently experiencing sky-rocketing costs (~800 million dollars per new drug) in addition to steadily decreasing productivity. These struggles are attributed in part to unforeseen side-effects of promising drug candidates and by a lack of validated cellular ""targets"" to which a drug can bind and elicit a medicinal effect.

"Machine Learning Applied to Automated Planar Patch Clamps    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The introduction of automated planar patch clamp instruments over the past two years has increased the throughput of voltage clamp ion channel assays by a factor of at least ten. This is possible because the automated systems can perform assays in parallel using16 and 384-well plates. While the drug discovery industry has embraced this new technology, the enthusiasm has been tempered by the modest success rates of the assays and by the high cost of the consumable patch substrate. Currently, typical success rates for a standard ion channel assay, using, for example, the Q-Patch from Sophion Biosciences, the Port-a-Patch system from Nanion Biosciences, or the PatchXpress from Molecular Devices Corp., is around 50%. In other words, for every16 channel chip used in these systems, only eight will produce useable data. This effectively doubles the price of each data point over what is ideally possible. In order for a planar patch clamp experiment to succeed, several events need to occur (assuming that the cell expresses the appropriate ion channels in functional states): the cell of interest must form a high-resistance seal with the planar substrate, the whole-cell configuration must be achieved, and fluidic pathways must be intact so that compounds of interest maybe applied to the cell. A failure of anyone of these steps will result in no data collected from that well. We propose to optimize the first two steps in this process, namely, seal formation and entry into whole-cell recording configuration. We will use machine learning approaches to examine how a human patch clamp expert interacts with the patch clamp system in order to develop a model that will provide parameters that can be used to more efficiently and successfully provide useable whole-cell recording configuration. It is important to note that the model that we derive from our approach will not actually copy what the expert does, but will attempt to optimize the process based on cues that mayor may not be consciously monitored by the expert. The Specific Aims of the Phase I component will be to: (1) integrate recording capabilities into existing automated patch clamp software from Nanion, (2) evaluate the success rate of the procedure specified by our machine learning analysis, and (3) develop stand-alone software for use specifically with manual patch clamp setups and for exploration of the potential benefits of using machine learning via expert training in other applications. In Phase II we propose to develop the proof-of-concept software into a user-friendly commercial software module which we will offer to existing and potential automated patch clamp companies. We will also simplify and streamline the user interface of this software as a stand-alone component for manual patch clamp systems. Developing drugs that target ion channels has been hindered by the expense of the consumables used in automated patch clamp screening devices. We propose to develop a method, using machine learning techniques which may increase the success rate of these instruments and therefore lower the overall cost of ion channel drug discovery.          n/a",Machine Learning Applied to Automated Planar Patch Clamps,7220448,R43EB007148,"['Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Employee Strikes', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Ion Channel', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Running', 'Sales', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cell type', 'concept', 'cost', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'new technology', 'patch clamp', 'programs', 'research study', 'seal', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'voltage', 'voltage clamp']",NIBIB,BLATZ SCIENTIFIC,R43,2007,199389,-0.0010310061471902909
"Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive Enhancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to NIMH research topic J1, neuroscience and basic behavioral science in the SBIR solicitation and PA-04-086, development of high throughput tools for brain and behavior. We aim to alleviate the bottleneck in drug discovery for cognitive dysfunction with CognoCube(tm), an automated high-throughput system of behavioral analysis of cognitive function. CognoCube(tm) will comprise innovative automated testing, computer vision, and machine-learning algorithms to capture and integrate behavioral effects of drugs affecting cognitive function. CognoCube will capture many cognitive domains of high degree of homology between humans and rodents that are relevant in CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia, attention-deficit disorder and ageing. This system will provide rapid and accurate indices of the therapeutic potential of novel cognitive enhancers. Phase I will be focused on proof of concept, namely, capture of behaviors relevant to targeted cognitive domains, sensitivity to pharmacological manipulation and robust bioinformatic analysis. The CognoCube(tm) system will expand its capacity during Phase II of the project to be able to assess a library of 1000 compounds per year. With libraries chosen to provide a high likelihood of CNS activity we expect to be able to detect up to a dozen new compounds per year with CNS activity in the area of cognition. Those compounds will be further assessed with standard tests of cognition and their mechanism of action will be studied through pharmacological means and binding profiling. Commercial value: The population that could benefit from new and improved cognitive enhancers is estimated at more than 30 million in the United States alone. Major challenges for drug discovery in this area include the lack of reliable and efficient in vivo testing systems. Although standardized objective test batteries have been developed for evaluation of human cognition, there is no such standard battery for rodents. Our automated cognitive testing system for mice will provide superior reliability, greater statistical power and higher throughput than standard cognitive tests and, with its power to screen libraries in vivo, will discover novel compounds with efficacy in cognition.         n/a",Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive Enhancers,7169555,R43MH076342,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Basic Behavioral Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mouse Strains', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Nootropic Agents', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Somatotype', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Index', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'concept', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2007,199963,0.017192336153769257
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips.

"HIGH THROUGHPUT IN VIVO DRUG DISCOVERY-PHASE 1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The current trend in drug discovery is to develop drugs with a high level of selectivity for a single receptor. Although this is a real improvement for certain therapeutic areas, this may present a real issue for the development of novel treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Indeed, neuropsychiatric disorders are complex, multigenic disorders that involve multiple neuronal circuits. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the most efficacious drugs in psychiatry, such as clozapine, are considered ""dirty drugs"" (i.e. have multiple targets), that were discovered by screening in vivo, i.e. looking at their behavioral impact using various animal models, rather than making predictions of their function based on their receptor profile. Although attractive, this approach was neither efficient nor scalable until now. PsychoGenics is developing a proprietary, high throughput, in vivo platform known as Smart Cube TM, which is being used to screen and select drug candidates with potential to treat major psychiatric disorders including depression, psychosis, and anxiety disorders. This approach examines the behavioral response of a mouse to various challenges under normal and perturbed (e.g. drug treated) conditions. Using computer vision algorithms, behavior is captured and bioinformatic tools are applied to reveal the temporal behavioral profile or ""signature"" in response to treatment.  PsychoGenics is building a database of signatures for known and approved compounds, which it can use to compare to the profiles of NCEs. PsychoGenics aims to demonstrate that this behavior-driven approach to drug discovery can yield clinical candidates selected from high quality libraries designed with compounds that have drug-like chemical and structural properties. The goal is to screen 120 compounds in Abstract compounds in Smart CubeTM in Phase I to find ""hits"" which, with the aid of novel computational chemistry algorithms, undergo behavior-driven (i.e. Smart Cube TM) lead optimization in Phase II. Using this behavior-driven approach, PsychoGenics has already identified two compounds for the treatment of ADD.            n/a",HIGH THROUGHPUT IN VIVO DRUG DISCOVERY-PHASE 1,6851710,R43MH070240,"['antidepressants', 'antipsychotic agents', 'biotechnology', 'cell surface receptors', 'chemical structure', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'computer program /software', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'high throughput technology', 'laboratory mouse', 'mental disorder chemotherapy', 'psychopharmacology', 'tranquilizer']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2005,250000,0.048060833234047855

"Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This project bridges the understanding between physical and chemical principles and genomic/proteomic response by integrating three independent parallel toxicity prediction tools. Each uses computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets to rapidly and accurately make pharmaceutical/chemical toxicity predictions. A CNN-based Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) module makes toxicological predictions based only on structure-activity analyses; a second CNN/wavelet module makes independent toxicogenomic predictions using microarray data; and a third CNN/wavelet module makes toxicogenomic predictions using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data. This multi-intelligent, three-module approach provides crosschecks to reduce false positives and false negatives while substantially increasing confidence in predictions relative to current computer-based toxicity prediction techniques. The resulting product could potentially become a primary tool used by (a) human health researchers, b) pharmaceutical companies for screening drugs early during development, c) companies designing/developing new chemicals and chemically treated materials, and (d) government organizations (e.g., military) for mission-related chemical deployments. Public benefits include reduced health and environmental risks (e.g., 4 out of 5 chemicals in use today have inadequate testing); reduced reliance on animal testing; and reduced time and cost required to bring new pharmaceuticals and chemicals into beneficial medical and commercial use.            n/a",Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction,6743871,R41ES013321,"['computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'evaluation /testing', 'method development', 'microarray technology', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'toxicant screening', 'toxicology']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R41,2004,211770,0.01968564313428783
"HIGH THROUGHPUT IN VIVO DRUG DISCOVERY-PHASE 1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The current trend in drug discovery is to develop drugs with a high level of selectivity for a single receptor. Although this is a real improvement for certain therapeutic areas, this may present a real issue for the development of novel treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Indeed, neuropsychiatric disorders are complex, multigenic disorders that involve multiple neuronal circuits. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the most efficacious drugs in psychiatry, such as clozapine, are considered ""dirty drugs"" (i.e. have multiple targets), that were discovered by screening in vivo, i.e. looking at their behavioral impact using various animal models, rather than making predictions of their function based on their receptor profile. Although attractive, this approach was neither efficient nor scalable until now. PsychoGenics is developing a proprietary, high throughput, in vivo platform known as Smart Cube TM, which is being used to screen and select drug candidates with potential to treat major psychiatric disorders including depression, psychosis, and anxiety disorders. This approach examines the behavioral response of a mouse to various challenges under normal and perturbed (e.g. drug treated) conditions. Using computer vision algorithms, behavior is captured and bioinformatic tools are applied to reveal the temporal behavioral profile or ""signature"" in response to treatment.  PsychoGenics is building a database of signatures for known and approved compounds, which it can use to compare to the profiles of NCEs. PsychoGenics aims to demonstrate that this behavior-driven approach to drug discovery can yield clinical candidates selected from high quality libraries designed with compounds that have drug-like chemical and structural properties. The goal is to screen 120 compounds in Abstract compounds in Smart CubeTM in Phase I to find ""hits"" which, with the aid of novel computational chemistry algorithms, undergo behavior-driven (i.e. Smart Cube TM) lead optimization in Phase II. Using this behavior-driven approach, PsychoGenics has already identified two compounds for the treatment of ADD.            n/a",HIGH THROUGHPUT IN VIVO DRUG DISCOVERY-PHASE 1,6744702,R43MH070240,"['antidepressants', 'antipsychotic agents', 'biotechnology', 'cell surface receptors', 'chemical structure', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'computer program /software', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'high throughput technology', 'laboratory mouse', 'mental disorder chemotherapy', 'psychopharmacology', 'tranquilizer']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2004,250000,0.048060833234047855
"A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this work is to provide a novel probabilistic computational engine for docking-based virtual screening. The engine is based on probabilistic model of Markov Random Fieds (MRF). MRF's have proven successful in other fields such as Computer Vision, and can be seen as a 3D analog of the successful 1D application of Hidden Markov Models to bioinformatics. The docking of a rigid ligand or ligand fragment into a protein active site is modeled as a weighted graphical match of an abstracted description of the ligand to an abstracted description of the active site. These abstracted descriptions are graphs, whose nodes are chemical entities (hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, hydrophobic spheres and etc.) and whose edges are associated distance constraints. The weighted graph-matching problem is expressed as an MRF, whose solution minimizes its associated free energy function. A fast, convergent message-passing scheme called Belief Propagation is used to solve the MRF. The result is a probability distribution that describes all possible placements of the ligand into the active site. Individual low-energy placements of the molecule are obtained by marginalizing this probability distribution. The method provides a fast and mathematically complete examination of possible fits of the ligand into the protein active site, and our prototype MRF application demonstrates excellent timing and completeness properties. The method also provides an attractive data structure enabling a variety of applications. The data structure intrinsically admits an enriched description of the active site. This description can incorporate an extended set of chemical substructures for matching at its nodes. It also can incorporate sets of probabilistic beliefs, expressed as probabilistic prior distributions. These can be used to bias matches according to known actives. Our goals in Phase I are to further develop our prototype into a robust MRF-based docking engine to positioning rigid molecules and molecular fragments into protein active sites. Our goals in Phase II will be to implement applications based on the MRF docking engine: (i) inclusion flexible ligand docking, (ii) incorporation of flexible side chains into docking, (iii) de-novo ligand design, and (iv) docking into multiple aligned proteins. We will seek corporate partners interested in collaborating on applying the technologies to specific problems in drug discovery in Phase I1. The technology developed will be sold as commercial software in Phase III. n/a",A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening,6786885,R43GM071055,"['binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'ligands', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,"BIOCOMPUTING GROUP, INC.",R43,2004,153420,-0.02154654244553743
"MCASE QSAR Expert System for Salmonella Mutagenicity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational expert systems provide an         inexpensive and fast alternative to short term genotoxicity assays such as the       Ames test. Validation studies show the predictive capability of the MCASE            system is about 85 percent. That is, 85 percent concordance is expected between      experiment and computational genotoxicity predictions for new chemicals.

"Toxicological Evaluation Neuralnet Tools (TENT)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  YAHSGS' Toxicological Evaluation Neuralnet Tools (TEND is designed to advance the state-of-the-art in the prediction of toxicological end points for new or untested chemicals, drugs, and compounds. TENT deploys computational neural nets (CNN), innovative computational chemistry methods, and modem statistical regression methods into interactive modules that determine (a) a chemical's 3-D structure and physical chemistry properties, (b) Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships, (C) mechanistic modes leading to toxicological responses via microassay database analysis, and (d) a broad spectrum of toxicological properties via CNN 3-D structural similarity analyses. TENTs output includes physical chemistry properties, 3-D structure, predicted toxicological impacts, and confidence level associated with each. It is anticipated that TENT will become one of the primary tools used by (a) researchers in human health and toxicological fields, (b) pharmaceutical companies to screen out drugs early in the development process prior to expending hundreds of millions on clinical in vivo and in vitro testing, (C) by companies developing new chemicals, chemical compounds, and chemically treated materials to determine potential toxicological impacts including those caused by environmental changes during and after usage, (d) companies striving to show compliance with ISO 14000 for materials used in their products, and (e) federal and military organizations for chemicals and materials contemplated for use in their mission areas.

"Colon Cancer Networks: Linking Modeling to Experiment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development of computational models of signal transduction pathways implicated in colon cancer is proposed. These models give insight into the pathway's dynamical behavior and elucidate their roles in activating known oncogenic target genes. The project will model the Ras Map Kinase signal transduction pathway, which plays a central role in the development of colon cancer. The methods utilized, which will be further developed, combine computational modeling with experiments so that unknown parameters in the model are constrained.

"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity-related and drug discovery endpoints. Our Phase I SBIR proposal called MegaTox will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo toxicity datasets. We propose using this technology to generate machine learning models for predicting potential compounds against either TGF- a target for countering chlorine induced lung inflammation as well as the adenosine A1 receptor to identify agonists as potential anticonvulsants. In addition, we can also compile molecules that can reactivate acetylcholinesterase which would enable the potential to discover medical countermeasures to address nerve agent and pesticide poisoning. We will access multiple machine learning approaches and validate these Bayesian or other machine learning models (including Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth) with our own in-house technology for these selected targets. We will aim for ROC values greater than 0.75 and MCC and F1 scores that are acceptable (>0.3). These models will be used to virtually screen FDA approved drugs, clinical candidates, commercially available drugs or other molecules. We will select up to 50 molecules to be tested using in vitro assays alongside controls for each target. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the medical countermeasures scientific community. In summary, we are proposing to build and validate models for targets based on public databases, select compounds for testing, create proprietary data and use this as a starting point for further optimization of compounds if needed. Our goal is to identify at least one promising compound for each target that we then pursue and protect our IP. We will pursue additional grant funding to take these medical countermeasures through additional in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Ultimately, we will license our products to larger companies for development prior to clinical trials. Project Narrative There is an urgent need to develop medical countermeasures (MCM) to address pulmonary agents, nerve agents and organophosphorus pesticides. Our approach leverages public and private data to build machine learning models for different targets involved in the physiological effects of the aforementioned agents. We then use these computational models to select new molecules to test in vitro. Our approach builds on our MegaTox approach focused on modeling toxicology targets to specifically focus on identifying compounds for TGF-β and Adenosine A1 as well as potential AChE reactivators.

"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment. We will experimentally validate these predictions in-house or through our network of collaborators.",MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions,10055938,R43AT010585,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Fingerprint', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'commercial application', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'model building', 'novel', 'open data', 'pharmacophore', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'process repeatability', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'software development', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NCCIH,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2020,155686,0.032608597222760514
"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways. Our proposal is designed to accelerate the pace of early drug discovery.","Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens",9885647,R01CA184984,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Time', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemical genetics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'genetic profiling', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'proteostasis', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'transcriptomics']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,480849,0.015265713366576977
"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,9992249,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2020,30514,-0.0349877884672308
"Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10142097,F32DC019030,"['Address', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Food', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Palate', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Programmed Learning', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality Control', 'Recipe', 'Research', 'Research Technics', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'food science', 'human subject', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'skills', 'sound']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2020,67446,0.019787937610407924
"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to continue development of a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. In Phase 1 we demonstrated that this representation enables computational models that more accurately predict the chemical properties of molecules than state-of-the-art models, yet are also far simpler to build because they do not require any expert decisions or optimization to achieve high performance. In Phase 2 we will exploit this unprecedented simplicity to develop an intuitive software package that will for the first time enable any chemist or biologist working in drug discovery to create and run their own predictive models – without relying on specialized cheminformatics expertise – yet still achieve or exceed the accuracy of the best currently available techniques. Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  We also plan to take the technology one step further, leveraging our chemically rich vector representation to enable the software to creatively suggest novel compounds (which do not appear in the training libraries, screening libraries, or lead series) that outperform the lead candidates simultaneously on bioactivity, ADME/Tox and PK assays . Solving this inverse problem is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry and has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target.

"A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening Project Summary High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery across NIH Institutes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3) create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible. Project Narrative The proposed project is broadly relevant to public health as a critical advancement of technology to enable basic biomedical research across therapeutic areas. This effort creates a computational platform to reduce the overall cost and improve the quality of high-throughput screening in any chemical biology or drug discovery project, which will be rigorously compared to existing experimental techniques.

"Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive. ADRS driven by immune-mediated hypersensitivity (including rashes, hepatotoxicity, and Steven-Johnson syndrome) are the most difficult to predict and occasionally can be severe as well as fatal. Hypersensitivity-driven ADRs are the leading cause of drug withdrawal and termination of clinical development. Yet a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid these ADRs entirely if reliable models of bioactivation existed. Accurate prediction and identification of molecules prone to ADRs would revolutionize drug development by screening out ADR-prone candidates early, before exposure to patients, and guiding drug modifications to reduce ADR risk. Small molecules are not intrinsically immunogenic and instead, involve bioactivation into reactive metabolite is that then covalently modify proteins to create immunogenic antigens. “Structural alerts” are molecular substructures prone to bioactivation, and they are often used to identify small molecules prone to bioactivation, and at risk of bioactivation-mediated ADRs. Currently, bioactivation relevant alerts are defined by experts, and they have important limitations that this study overcomes. It is now possible to predict metabolism and reactivity and toxicity using machine learning approaches. Building on this foundation, this proposal systematically discovers new structural alerts by explicitly modeling the impact of metabolism on reactivity and hence the potential to form ADR-relevant adducts. We hypothesize that (1) known bioactivation reactions, (2) molecule citation data, and (3) new substructure mining algorithms can be used to identify emerging structural alerts. Aim 1. We will test this hypothesis by using a computational approach to systematically mine structural alerts from databases of known metabolism and reactivity reactions. Aim 2. We will computationally and experimentally validate structural alerts and assess their structural contingencies. Structural alerts are only conditionally bioactivated, depending on the precise molecule they appear. Newly proposed structural alerts, moreover, are most useful when there is experimental evidence that they in fact can be bioactivated.  PubHlthRel: Structural alerts discovered in this study will help scientists avoid toxic molecules in drug development, and better understand why medicines on the market become toxic. Overcoming a fundamental limitation with structural alerts, machine learning models of bioactivation will clarify in which molecules alerts are and are not bioactivated. This knowledge will help scientists make safer medicines in the future, modify existing medicines to make them safer, and reduce ADRs by using existing medicines more safely. Modified Public Health Relevance Section  Some medicines cause dangerous and expensive Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), and many of these ADRs are caused by bioactivation. Structural alerts are substructures prone to bioactivation, and scientists use them to identify molecules prone to bioactivation mediated ADRs. Using a combined data-mining and experimental approach, this proposal systematically discovers emerging structural alerts of increased importance in recently studied molecules. Knowledge gained from these studies could foster improved dosing regimens for marketed drugs and enable scientists to design safer medicines.",Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts,10143838,R01GM140635,"['Acute Liver Failure', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Binding Proteins', 'Cell Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Metabolism', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'adduct', 'adverse drug reaction', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug market', 'drug modification', 'drug withdrawal', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'liver injury', 'mathematical model', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,395313,-0.01567019093736633
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9846198,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2020,1140875,0.05227902798736981
"Novel Methodology for Identification of Senolytics that Reduce Age-related Disease and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic diseases of aging account for a significant proportion of healthcare spending and result in a painful and limiting existence for many tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of people around the world. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that re-purposes known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content fluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced in human cells in which diseases and treatments have been modeled. This system has been adapted to screen for drugs which may preferentially destroy senescent cells, as this may result in improved tissue function and decreases in pathology and mortality related to aging. In this SBIR fast-track proposal we will:  PHASE I Identify a morphological profile of senescence in a variety of human cell types. Progression to Phase II will depend on our ability to demonstrate the power of our morphological approach to identify senescent cells independent of any known senescent markers.  PHASE II Identify known drugs which preferentially destroy senescent cells, without affecting healthy cells, as identified by morphometric means.  Evaluate the efficacy of identified senolytic agents in a variety of tissue function and health-span models in mice. *Evaluate the effect of identified senolytic agents in a murine model of age-associated cardiovascular disease. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I/Phase II Fast-track SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds we identify as a result. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic diseases of aging affect a significant proportion of Americans. Cellular senescence, a useful biological program which prevents replication of cells exposed to various stresses that may be at risk of initiating tumors, has long-term deleterious inflammatory effects.

"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data. The primary deliverable of this project will be a publically-accessible, web-based search engine to evaluate new chemicals for risk of hepatotoxicity.",Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity,9864299,R01ES031080,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Antioxidants', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cryopreservation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Costs', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nutraceutical', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'PubChem', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Response Elements', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statutes and Laws', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'candidate validation', 'cell injury', 'combat', 'computational toxicology', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'experimental study', 'hepatocellular injury', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'liver injury', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'reproductive toxicity', 'research clinical testing', 'safety assessment', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'search engine', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIEHS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ CAMDEN,R01,2020,465692,0.053319298081993906
"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9983443,R43MH121136,"['Animal Model', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinically relevant', 'drug classification', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2020,88432,0.03206144759053146
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9872178,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'data analysis pipeline', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,314000,0.01266423122229031
"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria Project Summary/Abstract Fungal and bacterial pathogens are a major threat to human health. Few therapeutics exist to treat fungal infections while bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to existing therapeutics. Humans have been using natural products to treat infections for thousands of years, long before the causal agents of infection were understood. Natural products have continued to be used as therapeutics in the modern age of medicine. Rates of rediscovery of known natural products have increased in traditional sources of natural products, such as soil bacteria. Recently, symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems have been recognized as a promising source of bioactive compounds, especially antifungal agents. These bacteria often produce natural products that defend an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use chemical biology approaches such as phenotypic interaction screens, genomics, and a new bioinformatics approach to systematically search for bioactive natural products produced by Actinobacteria symbionts and other organisms in insect agricultural systems. The first part of this proposal focuses on using existing techniques to identify new bioactive natural products. Phenotypic interaction screens can identify bioactive natural products by determining if a symbiotic bacteria produces a natural product that inhibits the growth of a fungal pathogen and vice-versa. We will then use genomic sequencing, bioinformatics, and heterologous expression to identify and characterize biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are not expressed in the phenotypic interaction screens. The second part of the proposed work involves the use of a new bioinformatics technique to identify interesting bioactive natural products. Existing bioinformatics techniques identify BGCs and predict the most likely chemical structure of the corresponding natural product. However, they do not conclude anything concerning the functional role that the natural product plays. The technique developed here will use machine learning to predict the function that the natural product fulfills in the ecological context of the organism. This algorithm will facilitate the identification of bioactive natural products with therapeutically relevant functions. Project Narrative Fungal infections are an underappreciated threat to human health with high mortality rates and few effective therapeutic agents for treatment. Symbiotic Actinobacteria from insect agricultural systems are a promising source of antifungal agents since they often produce natural products with antifungal activity protecting an insect’s fungal crop from pathogenic fungus. The work proposed here will use phenotypic interaction screens, genome sequencing, and the development of a novel bioinformatics method to systematically mine Actinobacteria for antifungal and antibacterial products – leading to the discovery of new bioactive small molecules along with a deeper understanding of how natural products mediate the interaction between species in insect agricultural systems.",Bioinformatics and Chemical Biology Approaches for Identifying Bioactive Natural Products of Symbiotic Actinobacteria,9963295,F32GM128267,"['Actinobacteria class', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Ants', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mycoses', 'Natural Products', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'bioactive natural products', 'drug discovery', 'fungus', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'post-doctoral training', 'prediction algorithm', 'small molecule', 'symbiont']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F32,2020,65310,0.02147938845404529
"Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal focuses on the challenge of identifying drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer’s Disease. The foundation of this work is the ReFRAME library, a set of ~13,000 compounds that includes nearly all small molecules that have been FDA-approved, reached clinical development, or undergone significant preclinical profiling. The ReFRAME library is being actively screened against a diverse cross-section of in vitro assays. This proposal pursues three distinct strategies for identifying repositioning candidates among the ReFRAME collection. First, we will create and mine a large and heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph. We will use machine learning methods to identify repositioning candidates based on properties of the knowledge graph surrounding and joining each drug and disease. Second, we will mine a massive data set of insurance claims data for associations between drug use and the incidence or severity of Alzheimer’s Disease. Containing almost 7 billion medical claims and over 2 billion pharmacy claims, this data set represents the largest source of claims data available. Third, we will use concept of gene expression complementarity to identify repositioning candidates. We will generate a gene expression signature for every ReFRAME compound in three cell lines relevant to Alzheimer’s Disease, and we will screen for compounds that produce a signature that appear to reverse gene expression changes seen in Alzheimer’s Disease. After assembling repositioning candidates identified through all three of these methods, we will prioritize up to 100 compounds (or compound combinations) for further characterization and validation. These follow-up experiments will initially investigate the activity of these compounds in five cell-based assays to establish a mechanistic hypothesis on their mechanism of action in Alzheimer’s Disease. Secondary follow-up experiments may include validation in some combination of in vitro (including hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons and/or organoids) and in vivo systems. We believe that the multifaceted approach described in this proposal offers the best possible chance at successfully identifying AD repositioning candidates. Moreover, this work will create methods and resources that will be useful to the broader scientific community, both for Alzheimer’s Disease and for other disease areas. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project focuses on discovering new treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. We specifically are looking for drugs that are already approved (or were previously tested) to treat other diseases to see if they can be beneficial for Alzheimer’s Disease patients.

"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health. NARRATIVE This proposal describes a platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical forces in cells, which play major roles in human health. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride.

"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets.

"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health. The research described here will enable a deeper understanding of disease-related microbial systems and help to formulate strategies to combat diseases.",Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space,10029526,R35GM138241,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Devices', 'Dioxygen', 'Disease', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Heterogeneity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Chemistry', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Nanoarray Analytical Device', 'Nature', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Transition Elements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'combat', 'extracellular', 'gut microbiota', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'microorganism culture', 'nano', 'nanomaterials', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2020,371084,0.020170301340945187
"Phenotypic assay for drug discovery and personalized medicine based on real-time vibrational spectroscopy enhanced by plasmonic metasurfaces Abstract The goal of this research is to develop a new spectroscopic technique – Time-dependent Infrared Reflection Spectroscopy Assay (TIRSA) – that will enable us to measure the real-time spectral response of a cell to various pharmacological compounds. The uniqueness of TIRSA is that it exploits infrared-reflective plasmonic (gold) metasurfaces to detect, as a function of time, biochemical changes in close proximity of cellular membranes, as well as cytoskeleton reorganization occurring. The optical spectra obtained over the course of several hours after administering the drug will be used to identify its effects on signaling pathways without any labels because vibrational fingerprints of biomolecules are the natural labels. Unlike time-consuming cytotoxic assays, the TIRSA can be potentially as short as several hours, thereby addressing one of the most serious deficiencies of phenotypic assays: their low throughput. Powerful techniques of machine learning (ML) will be used to process the enormous amount of biochemical information obtained by TIRSA, and to conduct supervised and unsupervised data analysis that will be based on large libraries of spectral cellular responses to single-target chemical compounds such as kinase inhibitors and others. New laser-based hardware for TIRSA will enable high sensitivity, time and space resolution. Relevance Statement: The goal of our program is to demonstrate the feasibility of combining time-dependent infrared spectroscopy to determine the Mode of Action (MOA) of various compounds, including apoptosis- inducing cytotoxic compounds as well as kinase inhibitors. We will develop new hardware for laser-based micro- spectroscopy. The resulting Time-Dependent Reflection Spectroscopic Assay (TIRSA) will serve as the first spectroscopy-based whole-cell phenotypic drug assay that will detect cellular responses to anti-cancer compounds and sensitizers.",Phenotypic assay for drug discovery and personalized medicine based on real-time vibrational spectroscopy enhanced by plasmonic metasurfaces,10025960,R21CA251052,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Matrix Junction', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drug resistance', 'EGF gene', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Fourier Transform', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'anti-cancer', 'assay development', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cytotoxic', 'design', 'detector', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'electric impedance', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infrared spectroscopy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'kinase inhibitor', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'optical spectra', 'overexpression', 'personalized medicine', 'plasmonics', 'polypeptide', 'precision drugs', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'temporal measurement', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'vector', 'vibration']",NCI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,598729,0.047158754583090386
"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We propose a novel strategy to develop a class of integrated quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) that create highly accurate physical models for complex biomolecular simulations. Com- bined with recently developed high-precision free energy simulation and analysis tools, the pro- posed QMFFs will overcome current critical barriers to progress for drug discovery and deliver accurate and precise predictions for drug binding afﬁnity to enhance lead optimization. The pro- posed work will be applied to understand ligand-protein binding in the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), and provide insight that may guide the design of new non-covalent and targeted covalent inhibitors to MIF and other systems.",Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications,10005389,R01GM107485,"['Affinity', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Books', 'Cations', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Free Energy', 'Halogens', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lead optimization', 'macrophage', 'mechanical force', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,320588,0.011643408614531812
"Optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition for antibiotic development Project Summary Failures of antibiotic therapy occur with increasing frequency in clinics due to the spread of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens. The major challenge are infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are protected from antibiotics by the concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps and the low permeability barrier of outer membranes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for a variety of infectious diseases, is notorious for its antibiotic impermeability. A handful of clinical antibiotics used against this pathogen are beginning to fail due to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. New antibiotics are needed to address this growing threat. Decades of antibiotic discovery and optimization perfected empirical approaches for improvement of antibiotic action and avoidance of class-specific resistance mechanisms. The current critical challenge is to develop approaches that will enable antibiotic penetration across non-specific permeability barriers of Gram-negative bacteria, which present an urgent and serious threat to public health. This project responds to this challenge and proposes the development of a new technology for optimization of efflux avoidance and inhibition in clinical and investigational antibacterial agents that will be effective against Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed approach targets simultaneously the multidrug efflux mechanism of P. aeruginosa and its outer membrane barrier and combines cutting edge technologies in experimental analyses of efflux inhibition and drug penetration, kinetic modeling of drug accumulation, computer simulations of drug efflux and transmembrane diffusion, synthetic chemistry and machine learning analyses. The central objective of the proposal is to create a mechanism-based predictive model that integrates physicochemical properties of compounds, kinetics of their intracellular accumulation and transmembrane diffusion, and a molecular level description of the interaction of efflux transporters with their substrates and inhibitors. The model will be validated by focused medicinal chemistry efforts to generate antibacterial agents that combine the traits of effective antibiotics and potent efflux pump inhibitors or avoiders. This multi-disciplinary approach is enabled by the collaborative efforts of PIs on the project: Helen Zgurskaya (biochemistry of drug uptake and efflux), Valentin Rybenkov (kinetic modeling), Paolo Ruggerone (computational biophysics of efflux), Gnanakaran (computational simulations of membrane permeation) and John Walker (medicinal chemistry). Narrative This project addresses a current critical challenge in the discovery and development of antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10051923,R01AI148740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Capsid', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Encapsulated', 'Equilibrium', 'Failure', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'dimer', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lead optimization', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'programs', 'protein oligomer', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success', 'viral genomics']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,407510,-0.010397922012434606
"A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus PROJECT SUMMARY Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) is a group of closely related nontuberculous mycobacteria, which primarily cause infections in persons with underlying lung disease, compromised immunity or other risk factors. MABSC organisms are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and treatment requires many months of multiple antibiotics, often with significant toxicity and low cure rates. One of the difficulties in optimizing the treatment of MABSC infections is the lack of a robust pipeline for the identification of multidrug regimens that may be more efficacious than the current standard of care. A strategy for prioritizing multidrug regimens is necessary, because the number of combinations to test can be overwhelming. For example, with even just 12 drugs to select from there are 220 potential 3 drug combinations. This project proposes to develop INDIGO (INferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning modeling approach, to identify drug combinations with strong potential synergistic activity against MABSC and to test these regimens in an animal model. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Build and refine an INDIGO-MABSC model through the collection of transcriptomic data from drug treated MABSC cultures, subsequent experimental verification of antibiotic synergy and antagonism followed by model refinement with iterative rounds of model building and testing; 2) Assess the efficacy of top predicted synergistic multidrug regimens in a zebrafish model for MABSC infection. INDIGO modeling is modular, so as new agents become available they may be incorporated into the model to make predictions for how these agents may be best combined into multidrug regimens. The overall goal of this project is to provide a streamlined pipeline for identifying regimens that can be pushed into advanced pre-clinical and clinical trials for treatment of MABSC infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bacteria from the Mycobacterium abscessus group cause lung and other infections in persons with underlying medical comorbidities, which are incredibly difficult to treat due to the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. This project uses gene expression profiling, computer modeling, and a zebrafish infection model to identify new combination antibiotic regimens that may be more effective against Mycobacterium abscessus. Results from these studies could prompt future clinical trials to test these regimens in humans for efficacy.",A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus,9898274,R21AI144536,"['Adjuvant', 'American', 'Amikacin', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Bronchiectasis', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Antibiotics', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Imipenem', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Macrolides', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mycobacterium Infections', 'Mycobacterium abscessus', 'Mycobacterium avium Complex', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'New Agents', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Societies', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Triage', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Tuberculosis', 'Veins', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'comorbidity', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'data registry', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug testing', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'model building', 'non-tuberculosis mycobacteria', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient screening', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process', 'treatment optimization']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,212873,-0.010809989176262814
"Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies Chemical warfare and the use of mustard gas on civilian population poses a major risk. Vesicating agents, such as mustard gas, cause severe damage to the corneas that can result in blindness and severe loss of sight. There are currently limited therapeutic options for treatment of damage caused by vesicating agents. To enable the rapid development of much needed medical countermeasures, the proposed work will test the possibility of drug repurposing. Drug repurposing strategies are based on the identification of new uses for existing drugs. Drug repurposing is a demonstrated successful strategy that can lower the cost of drug development and reduce development time. The key challenge in drug repurposing is the need to identify novel drug-disease relationships. To address this challenge we will deploy a set of innovative microscopy approaches that will provide rich data on the subtle aspects of the impact existing drugs have on corneal healing from chemical injury. Specifically, in Aim #1 we will perform a chemical screen of 770 existing drugs using live, organ culture, image-based assay. Mice corneas will be imaged for 48 hours after wound and sophisticated computer vision algorithm will be used to extract data on stem cell proliferation, cell death, cell migration, and wound closure. In Aim #2 we will construct spatiotemporal cornea-specific cell atlas of migration, proliferation, inflammatory signaling and gene expression response to chemical injury for controls, and drug-treated corneas. The cell atlases will provide a key resource on the process of chemical injury, the mechanism of action of existing therapies, and the mechanism of action of the most promising new drugs identified in Aim #1. Collectively, the results of this work will exploit the possibility of drug repurposing for the treatment of ocular injury caused by vesicants. The resource we will generate, i.e .the information on existing drugs and the detailed cell atlases of the process of healing will build the foundation for the rapid future development of much needed medical countermeasures. Chemical weapons such as mustard gas can cause severe damage to the eye and lead to blindness. Here we will use sophisticated microscopy tools to test how does the eye heal when treating by existing FDA approved drugs and generate an atlas of the cellular response to chemical injury. Our results will support efforts to repurpose existing drugs to provide much needed medical countermeasures to combat chemical warfare.",Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies,9934566,R21EY031283,"['Accidents', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Warfare', 'Chemical Weapons', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'End Point Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Injuries', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mechlorethamine', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mustard Gas', 'Organ', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Type I Epithelial Receptor Cell', 'Vesicants', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'combat', 'corneal epithelial wound healing', 'corneal regeneration', 'drug development', 'first responder', 'healing', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical countermeasure', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'response', 'response to injury', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell proliferation', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment effect', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,185776,-0.009325632161496289
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9982190,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'kinetic model', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,1239304,0.02183566143925107
"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we willl bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This supplement to the original RO1 is to purchase a small GPU cluster to enable rapid prototyping of many of the approaches that are proposed in this project outlined in the four aims.

"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,9917854,R01NS100531,"['Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Complement 5a', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Control Animal', 'Contusions', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Failure', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery of Function', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Viral Vector', 'Walking', 'axon growth', 'axon regeneration', 'axonal sprouting', 'behavior test', 'behavioral outcome', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injured', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'light microscopy', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,465464,0.037255511383633755
"A Web Service for Fragment-based Selectivity Analysis of Drug Leads Abstract Significance: To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of human coronavirus. Better, direct-acting anti-viral drugs and accelerated methods for identifying them are desperately needed. Having a large body of diverse fragment binding simulation data for each SARS-CoV-2 drug target represents a unique opportunity to accelerate preclinical drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2 protein inhibitors. In contrast to testing-based approaches, understanding fragment interaction patterns provides chemists specific mechanistic information to guide lead optimization. We propose to (1) create comprehensive fragment maps for the full suite of SARS-CoV-2 proteins; (2) build automated tools for enumeration and evaluation of compounds that address protease selectivity and inhibition at Spike protein ppi and allosteric sites; and (3) make these available worldwide through the BMaps Web application. As such, all anti-viral researchers can benefit. Innovation: Generating thousands of fragment binding patterns for each of the known SARS-CoV-2 protein structures is a novel scientific approach to the rational design of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. This would be the largest data source of fragment data on SARS-CoV-2 drug targets available and the resource would be accessible by all scientists working to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The innovation proposed is to enable a new scientific approach to rational design for SARS-CoV-2 antivirals based on the analysis of fragment binding patterns using novel compound enumeration and evaluation methods. Aim 1: Generate fragment and water maps for the full suite of proteins involved in the coronavirus life cycle. Using hot spots for location bias, run ~1,000 fragment simulations on each consensus of 6 structures from molecular dynamics. Aim 2: Develop automated tools to accelerate the enumeration and evaluation of candidate inhibitor molecules. Two approaches are proposed: (1) adapt our test software to enumerate all available modifications with all fragments for a given starting point and (2) use a Conditional GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) deep learning network to enumerate inhibitors from fragments, using discriminator networks to bias towards synthesizable molecules with good properties. Aim 3. Build a repository of candidate inhibitors targeting coronavirus proteins through a variety of different mechanisms. Overall Impact: The SARS-CoV-2 protein-fragment maps lead chemists to often non-obvious ideas to progress their compounds toward clinical trials. The ability to automatically enumerate and evaluate compounds from a large fragment map repository enables broad access to target-relevant chemical diversity, without tedious manual searching. A repository of candidate inhibitors targeting coronavirus proteins enables drug researchers to get started quickly. Project Narrative Accessing diverse chemical fragment binding data (1,000s for each SARS-CoV-2 drug target) presents a unique opportunity to accelerate much needed preclinical drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The fragment-based drug design platform (BMaps, www.boltzmannmaps.com), built under NIH Phase I and II grants, will be extended with fragment maps for SARS-CoV-2 proteins and further automation of compound enumeration through fragment growing. This will empower antiviral drug researchers in attacking the difficult problems of SARS-CoV-2 protease selectivity and inhibitor binding at allosteric or protein-protein interaction sites on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.",A Web Service for Fragment-based Selectivity Analysis of Drug Leads,10149527,R43GM133284,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Therapy', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Capsid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hot Spot', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Property', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Water', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'human coronavirus', 'influenza M2', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'web app', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,"CONIFER POINT PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC",R43,2020,225000,-0.02607986336893083
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9857604,R01GM108340,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'virtual screening', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,313000,0.018371356040421543
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9973004,R01DK101674,"['Ablation', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cresol', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Ecosystem', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Process', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Sulfate', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Uremia', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'colon microbiota', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human subject', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstitution', 'solute', 'tool', 'translation to humans']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,690557,0.009149832667502323
"Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Project Abstract  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these “forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure- based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.  Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high- complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging (OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.  Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs) currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.  The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper- based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and molecular changes across the tissue-like structures. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a pipeline to screen and prioritize libraries of potentially toxic man-made chemicals found in the environment for further analyses, with particular emphasis on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) of which there are over 5000 currently known. Current environmental exposure testing methods evaluate mammary gland development in live mice because the mammary gland is highly susceptible to chemical exposure; yet, such methods are slow and expensive. Our proposal uses mammary cell culture models in increasingly complex, tissue-like environments, in combination with high-speed 3D optical imaging techniques, and ultimately compare the platform with a few candidate PFAS against existing data in live mice, setting the stage for future high-throughput screening of potential environmental toxicants.",Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),10152786,R01ES032730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Breast Cancer Epidemiology', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gland', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary gland', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mesenchymal', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'North Carolina', 'Odds Ratio', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinogenicity', 'cell motility', 'chemical stability', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging capabilities', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'mammary epithelium', 'mammary gland development', 'man', 'model design', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'premalignant', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,559511,0.01346273546589551
"Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products Mapping the Secondary Metabolomes of Marine Cyanobacteria Bacteria are extraordinarily prolific sources of structurally unique and biologically active natural products that derive from a diversity of fascinating biochemical pathways. However, the complete structure elucidation of natural products is often the most time consuming and costly endeavor in natural product drug discovery programs. Compounding this, advancements in genome sequencing have accelerated the identification of unique modular biosynthetic gene clusters in prokaryotes and revealed a wealth of new compounds yet to be isolated and biologically and chemically characterized. Resultantly, there is an urgent and continuing need in this field to connect biosynthetic gene clusters to their respective MS fragmentation signatures in the MS2 molecular networks. The capacity to make such connections will accelerate new compound discovery as well as create associations between gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, and aid in fast and accurate structure elucidations. Combined with this informatics approach, this proposed continuation project explores innovative methods by which to solve complex molecular structures by enhanced MS and NMR experiments, as well as the development of new algorithms by which to accelerate their analysis. Thus, the overarching goal of this grant is to develop efficient methods that facilitate automated structural classification, structural feature discovery and ultimately efficient structure elucidation of natural products (or any small molecule) and to build an infrastructure that interacts with data input from the community. We will achieve this with the following four specific aims: Aim 1. Integration of MS2 molecular networking with gene cluster networking to rapidly and efficiently locate natural products that have unique molecular architectures; Aim 2. To develop a suite of high sensitivity pulse sequences for natural product structure elucidation; Aim 3. To develop NMR based molecular networking strategies using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to facilitate the categorization and structure elucidation of organic compounds; Aim 4. To integrate NMR molecular networking and MS2-based molecular networking as an efficient structure characterization and elucidation strategy. By achieving these aims we will develop an innovative workflow for finding new compounds and for determining their structures, both quickly and accurately. The connection between gene cluster and molecule will shed light on stereochemistry and potential halogenations and methylations. This information can then be used in combination with more efficient NMR and MS methods to accurately determine structures. These tools will be widely shared, such as through the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Network, to enhance the overall capacity of the natural products and organic chemistry communities to solve complex molecular structures.   Natural products are compounds produced by natural sources and about 50 % of FDA approved drugs can trace their origin back to natural products. This proposal aims to use our data set of natural products produced by cyanobacteria for development of analytical tools that will speed- up and stream-line the discovery and structure elucidation of new compounds.  ",Tools for rapid and accurate structure elucidation of natural products,9921415,R01GM107550,"['Algae', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Light', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'analog', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genome sequencing', 'halogenation', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'social', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,514429,0.02823747165644939
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating infor- mation about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commer- cial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to for- malizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to be- come the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  In Phase 1 CDD developed the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. In Phase 2 CDD will continue to develop a sophisticated automated transla- tion tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that ma- chine readable mixture descriptions can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxi- cology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accu- rately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicol- ogy of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,9902210,R44TR002528,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Ally', 'Books', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Commercial Catalogs', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'male', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'structured data', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2020,748733,0.04075308244535145
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9952362,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,47875,0.013714296099327698
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9908105,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,291940,0.075634491382644
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Developing Drug-like Small Molecules that Target Toxic Repeat RNAs to Alleviate Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1-derived Mis-Splicing Project Summary Abstract Nymirum will utilize its technology platform to identify and optimize a drug-like, orally available small molecule that binds toxic CUG repeat RNAs to rescue myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) derived mis-splicing and treat the disease. DM1 is a rare genetic disorder that leads to progressive muscle degeneration, cardiovascular disease, severe cognitive disabilities, insulin resistance, and a host of other symptoms. There is no cure for DM1, and the only treatments are palliative. The cause of DM1 is an abnormal CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion (>34 repeats) in the 3′-UTR of DMPK that are transcribed into toxic CUG RNA repeats that accumulate in the nucleus of cells. Toxic CUG repeats sequester Muscleblind Like Splicing Regulator 1 (MBNL1), which is needed for normal splicing of hundreds of key neuromuscular related genes. Studies have shown that small molecules that bind CUG repeats can prevent MBNL1 sequestration and rescue nominal splicing in cells and animal models. However, these small molecules are bulky, very polar, and non-drug-like and therefore suffer from delivery and toxicity issues. Therefore the need remains to identify and optimize drug-like, orally available small molecules that bind CUG repeats and rescue DM1-derived mis-splicing in cells. Preliminary data highlights that the Nymirum platform has identified two classes of drug-like small molecules that can bind CUG repeats and can rescue DM1-derived mis-splicing in HeLa cells. This proposal seeks to go wider and deeper in order to identify and optimize more potent compounds. In Phase I, >2 billion compounds will be rapidly and accurately screened to identify additional classes of chemically diverse drug-like small molecule CUG binders. Those hits will then be optimized at the atomic level using the dynamic CUG structure to guide targeted medicinal chemistry to increase their potency and efficacy in HeLa cells. Phase II will carry out lead-generation in earnest on the hits identified in Phase I. Ultimately, this proposal will develop an orally available small molecule therapeutic to treat DM1. Project Narrative Nymirum is leveraging its platform to develop an orally available small molecule therapeutic that rescues myotonic dystrophy type 1 derived mis-splicing by binding toxic CUG RNA repeats and preventing them from sequestering a key splicing regulator (MBNL1).",Developing Drug-like Small Molecules that Target Toxic Repeat RNAs to Alleviate Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1-derived Mis-Splicing,10135372,R43NS117184,"['Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animal Model', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioavailable', 'Biological Assay', 'CUG repeat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Hela Cells', 'Inherited', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Retardation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscle', 'Myotonic Dystrophy', 'Myotonic dystrophy type 1', 'Oral', 'Palliative Care', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Visual impairment', 'cognitive disability', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'interest', 'muscle degeneration', 'neuromuscular', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rare genetic disorder', 'small molecule', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'success', 'targeted nucleases', 'three dimensional structure', 'virtual']",NINDS,"NYMIRUM, INC.",R43,2020,299267,0.020004966303951658
"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,9956440,R21ES031740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemically Induced Toxicity', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Wildfire', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'biomass smoke', 'computational toxicology', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'exposed human population', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'male', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoke inhalation', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,227277,0.014262055837895507
"Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY  The authors have developed a computational platform to rapidly identify optimal drug and dose combinations from the innumerable possibilities. By testing this technique termed Phenotypic Personalized Medicine (PPM) in a diverse number of experimental systems representing different diseases, they have found that the response of biological systems to drugs can be described by a low order, smooth multidimensional surface. The main consequence of this is that optimal drug combinations can be found in a small number of tests and that translation from in vitro to in vivo and ultimately to clinical application is enabled through a re- optimization process. This input–output relationship that is always based on experimental data in lieu of predicted responses may also lead to a straightforward solution for handling human diversity in cancer therapeutics, among other diseases. In these series of studies they will test the hypothesis that PPM can be developed and validated for clinical use by using it to find novel drug combinations of repurposed/repositioned drugs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is that by the end of year 3 of this project, they will be able to initiate a clinical trial using these novel combination or combinations.  This group has previously used PPM-based optimization to find novel drug combinations in in vitro and in vivo models of cancer and infection. They have shown that this approach was able to markedly improve the efficacy of colorectal cancer therapy in vivo in mouse models. Translationally in a first-in-human clinical trial, they recently completed a prospective clinical study involving 4 PPM-dosed patients and 4 control (standard of care dosed) patients. They calculated the tacrolimus dosing regimen using the PPM process. Because PPM does not require a priori knowledge of disease mechanism and because it is a dynamic process that can accommodate a changing system, it can efficiently find personalized drug dosing over a varying range of time, having a profound stabilizing effect on the tacrolimus trough levels.  For this application, they have selected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer) to be the human disease for PPM application. The key rationale for this clinical selection is that they have a wealth of in vitro data on HCC, an active HCC tumor biorepository, and a large clinical volume of patients with HCC. These existing resources, both in vitro and clinical, allow for the immediate exploration of combination discovery followed by a clinical validation of discovered combination candidates in patients with unresectable HCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project applies a computational platform (Phenotypic Precision Medicine) to optimize combination therapy for the treatment of liver cancer. Using empiric measurements of the responses to a given treatment regimen by liver cancer cell lines and mouse models, they will demonstrate a computational approach to finding and optimizing novel drug combinations using repurposed/repositioned drugs. First they will demonstrate the ability to devise novel combination therapies and then they will start planning for a clinical trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of this approach to the treatment of liver cancer.",Utilization of Phenotypic Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Drug Combinations for the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,9829406,UH3TR002087,"['BAY 54-9085', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'appropriate dose', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological systems', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer treatment', 'combinatorial', 'computational platform', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first-in-human', 'hepatocellular carcinoma cell line', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'personalized medicine', 'precision drugs', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tumor']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,UH3,2020,152462,-0.005224886277943658
"Role of Epigenetically Active  Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast Phase III chemical library (4700 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable. PROJECT NARRATIVE We developed a novel technique rooted in analysis of the epigenome topography at the single-cell level. Here, we propose to employ our new approach to identify novel environmental inducers of NDD.",Role of Epigenetically Active  Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders,9979666,R21ES030804,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Antidotes', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flowcharts', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Neurites', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Differentiation', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Protective Agents', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalidomide', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Validation', 'Valproic Acid', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'cell growth', 'cost effective', 'cytotoxicity', 'dashboard', 'environmental chemical', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'histone modification', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phthalates', 'progenitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'small molecule libraries', 'stem', 'stem cell fate', 'stem cell model', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R21,2020,292500,0.0051661930563238765
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9936120,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stimulator of Interferon Genes', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2020,714132,-0.016344576245200963
"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level.

"Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) – comprising the endocannabinoids, their G-protein coupled re- ceptors, and their metabolic enzymes – is one of the most important physiological systems involved in estab- lishing and maintaining human health. In some illnesses, ECS dysregulation is an element of disease pathol- ogy whereas in others it is believed to be protective. Thus, there is intense interest in developing pharma- cotherapies that target the ECS to blunt its pathologies or harness its protective effects. One of the main challenges in developing new drugs that target the ECS is the problem of side effects, con- sistent with the nearly ubiquitous expression of this signaling system. Current efforts to increase the functional specificity of ECS drugs include preventing them from crossing the blood brain barrier, and targeting ancillary ECS proteins which modulate principal ECS components without being direct effectors themselves. Until now, discovery of ancillary proteins has proceeded mainly by inference from prior knowledge obtained from isolated cells. This approach can be limiting because knowledge of the underlying genetic and biochemical networks is usually incomplete. Here we propose to develop new high-throughput methodologies to enable the first unbi- ased genetic screens to identify new ECS molecules in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is an omnivorous bacterivore but it learns to prefer some species of bacteria more than others. We recently discovered that one of the worm's endocannabinoids increases the worm’s appetite for favored foods over less favored foods, a phenomenon called hedonic amplification. We propose this system as a genetically tractable model of cannabinoid effects on appetitive behavior, providing an easily screenable phenotype that directly corresponds to a well-known human behavior. The research develops two high-throughput microfluidic systems for quantifying hedonic amplification in C. ele- gans. The systems are then utilized to perform two small-scale genetic screens as a prelude to future large- scale screens. In the first, hedonic amplification will be quantified in strains in which homologs of known mam- malian ECS components have been knocked out; this screen further validates the C. elegans ECS as a mam- malian model. In the second screen, hedonic amplification will be assessed in a select set of wild isolate strains of C. elegans to estimate the heritability of this phenotype. The research is significant because it could ultimately lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to mitigate disease and promote health. Cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms involving endocannabinoids are involved in numerous physiological and psy- chological conditions including nausea, obesity, pain, anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and neu- rodegenerative disease where they can be part of the disease or the body's protective response to it. However, most attempts to harness the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid signaling have been stymied by prob- lematic side effects. The proposed research develops and applies innovative methods to screen for genes en- coding new members of the endocannabinoid signaling system as potential drug targets for treatment of endo- cannabinoid-related diseases, with fewer and milder side effects.",Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans,9966951,R21DA047645,"['Action Potentials', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cells', 'Chemotaxis', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzymes', 'Fire - disasters', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'Mutagenesis', 'Names', 'Nausea', 'Nematoda', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obesity', 'Operating System', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Organ', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'anandamide', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cell type', 'design', 'endocannabinoid signaling', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'feeding', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic strain', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hedonic', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function mutation', 'marijuana use disorder', 'member', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2020,184375,0.008251791595522317
