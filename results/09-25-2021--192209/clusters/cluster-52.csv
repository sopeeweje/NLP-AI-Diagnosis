"CRCNS: Probabilistic models of perceptual grouping/segmentation in natural vision   To understand and navigate the environment, sensory systems must solve simultaneously two competing and challenging tasks: the segmentation of a sensory scene into individual objects and the grouping of elementary sensory features to build these objects. Understanding perceptual grouping and segmentation is therefore a major goal of sensory neuroscience, and it is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision. To make progress in understanding image segmentation and improving algorithms, this project combines two key components. First, a new experimental paradigm that allows for well-controlled measurements of perceptual segmentation of natural images. This addresses a major limitation of existing data that are either restricted to artificial stimuli, or, for natural images, rely on manual labeling and conflate perceptual, motor, and cognitive factors. Second, this project involves developing and testing a computational framework that accommodates bottom-up information about image statistics and top-down information about objects and behavioral goals. This is in contrast with the paradigmatic view of visual processing as a feedforward cascade of feature detectors, that has long dominated computer vision algorithms and our understanding of visual processing. The proposed approach builds instead on the influential theory that perception requires probabilistic inference to extract meaning from ambiguous sensory inputs. Segmentation is a prime example of inference on ambiguous inputs: the pixels of an image often cannot be labeled with certainty as grouped or segmented. This project will test the hypothesis that human visual segmentation is a process of hierarchical probabilistic inference. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether the measured variability of human segmentations reflects the uncertainty predicted by the model, as required for well-calibrated probabilistic inference. Specific Aim 2 addresses how feedforward and feedback processing in human segmentation contribute to efficient integration of visual features across different levels of complexity, from small contours to object parts. Specific Aim 3 will determine reciprocal interactions between perceptual segmentation and top-down influences including: semantic scene content; visual texture discrimination; and expectations reflecting environmental statistics. The proposed approach models these influences as Bayesian priors, and thus, if supported by the proposed experiments, will offer a unified framework to understand the integration of bottom-up and top- down influences in human segmentation of natural inputs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project aims to provide a unified understanding of perceptual segmentation and grouping of visual inputs encountered in the natural environment, through correct integration of the information contained in the visual inputs with top-down information about objects and behavioral goals. This understanding is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision in patient populations. n/a",CRCNS: Probabilistic models of perceptual grouping/segmentation in natural vision  ,9916219,R01EY031166,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discrimination', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Instruction', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recurrence', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'object recognition', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'sensory input', 'sensory integration', 'sensory neuroscience', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'theories', 'vision science', 'visual processing']",NEI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,195245,0.0655519242534893
"Natural image processing in the visual cortex Project Summary Signals from the natural environment are processed by neuronal populations in the cortex. Understanding the relationship between those signals and cortical activity is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating cortical processing of simple, parametric stimuli, and computational technology is improving descriptions of neural responses to naturalistic stimuli. However, how cortical populations encode the complex, natural inputs received during every day perceptual experience is largely unknown. This project aims to elucidate how natural visual inputs are represented by neuronal populations in primary visual cortex (V1). Progress to date has been limited primarily by two factors. First, during natural vision, the inputs to V1 neurons are always embedded in a spatial and temporal context, but how V1 integrates this contextual information in natural visual inputs is poorly understood. Second, prior work focused almost exclusively on single-neuron firing rate, but to understand cortical representations one must consider the structure of population activity— the substantial trial-to-trial variability that is shared among neurons and evolves dynamically—as this structure influences population information and perception. The central hypothesis of this project is that cortical response structure is modulated by visual context to approximate an optimal representation of natural visual inputs. To test the hypothesis, this project combines machine learning to quantify the statistical properties of natural visual inputs, with a theory of how cortical populations should encode those images to achieve an optimal representation, to arrive at concrete, falsifiable predictions for V1 response structure. The predictions will be tested with measurements of population activity in V1 of awake monkeys viewing natural images and movies. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether modulation of V1 response structure by spatial context in static images is consistent with optimal encoding of those images, and will compare the predictive power of the proposed model to alternative models. Specific Aim 2 addresses V1 encoding of dynamic natural inputs, and will test whether modulation of V1 activity by temporal context is tuned to the temporal structure of natural sensory signals, as required for optimality. As both spatial and temporal are present simultaneously during natural vision, Specific Aim 3 will determine visual input statistics in free-viewing animals, and test space-time interactions in V1 activity evoked by those inputs. This project will provide the first test of a unified functional theory of contextual modulation in V1 encoding of natural visual inputs, and shed light on key aspects of natural vision that have been neglected to date. Project Narrative This project aims to determine how neurons in the visual cortex represent the inputs encountered during perceptual experience in the natural environment, through correct integration of visual information across space and time. In individuals with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, integration is often miscalibrated leading to perceptual impairments. Our study will advance knowledge of the relationship between natural sensory inputs and cortical activity, which is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in patient populations.",Natural image processing in the visual cortex,9801995,R01EY030578,"['Address', 'Animal Testing', 'Area', 'Complex', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'V1 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'model development', 'movie', 'neglect', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'theories', 'vision science', 'visual information']",NEI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,417500,0.06155718868771101
"Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes Summary/Abstract Real world scenes contain a wealth of information that guide where we look and help us search for things in our visual environment more efficiently. For example, if you were looking for a person in a city, you would look mostly on the sidewalk, whereas if you were looking for a car, you would concentrate your attention on the street. Despite the fact that behavioral experiments have increasingly quantified the role of object and scene knowledge in the guidance of attention and eye movements, models of these processes, particularly neural models, neglect the role of visual knowledge. The goal of this project is to determine whether regions of the brain shown to be important for object and scene recognition are involved in visual guidance in natural scenes. Prior results, including our preliminary data, show that the neural activity from object processing regions can be used to predict what object a person is going to look at next. However, critical questions that remain are: is this predictive activity influenced by scene and object knowledge and is it causally related to visual guidance? Answering these two questions are the specific goals of this proposal. Individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy provide the rare opportunity of recording directly from the human brain (intracranial electroencephalography, iEEG), which provides a superior spatial and temporal resolution measure of brain activity compared to other technique. These direct recordings also allow for electrical brain stimulation (EBS), which can provide causal evidence tying the activity in particular regions to cognitive function. Finally, these data will be supplemented by magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to examine whole brain effects in healthy individuals. iEEG and MEG data arising from regions involved in object and scene recognition will be analyzed by multivariate machine learning techniques to continually classify what subjects are viewing on a moment-to- moment basis. Furthermore, we will try to predict what object subjects will view next during free viewing and visual search in natural scenes based on their neural data. We will assess how these neural signals are modified by the presence or absence of information about typical locations of objects or people in the scene that have been shown to guide behavior. Finally, using EBS we will determine if there is a causal link between the activity in regions involved in coding for object and scene knowledge and visual guidance in natural scene vision. If successful, these studies would necessitate a substantial reshaping of models of visual attention in the human brain. The results could form the foundation of a program of research into the neural basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world. Attention, perception, and eye movement abnormalities are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Thus, these studies, and the models that arise from them, have the translational potential to advance our understanding of the neurological basis of these disorders and suggest potential neurally inspired rehabilitation strategies. Narrative Abnormalities in visual attention and eye movement guidance are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including visual agnosia, neglect, schizophrenia, autism, etc. The neural basis of visual attention and eye movement guidance in the real world is unknown; therefore it remains unknown how neural abnormalities in these disorders relate to real world visual deficits, which is a critical barrier to designing hypothesis-driven remediation strategies. The proposed research will take critical early steps towards understanding the neural basis of real world attention and eye movement control, which has the potential to transform our understanding of these critical visual processes. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of eye movement and attentional guidance, a circuit relevant to a number of disorders, and take a critical step towards developing hypotheses for remediation strategies.",Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes,9830940,R21EY030297,"['Agnosia', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologic', 'Object Attachment', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Agnosias', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Walking', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'computer monitor', 'design', 'experimental study', 'neglect', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neurotransmission', 'programs', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'spatial relationship', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual search']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2019,234750,0.0795621560832511
"What you see is what you learn: Visual attention in statistical word learning PROJECT SUMMARY Individual differences in the quantity and quality of parent talk and individual differences in infant visual attention predict later vocabulary development, which in turn has the cascading consequences of later cognitive development and school achievement. The proposed research studies how infants prior to their first birthday begin to learn object names, and does so in a unique approach, focusing on how visual information from the infant perspective coincide with parent naming and on how infant looking behavior selects the data to be aggregated and how that selected data changes incrementally in statistical learning. Toward this goal, we will collect a corpus of infant-perspective scenes from 8-12-month-old infants as they play with their parent in a toy room and as parents naturally name objects during play. We will analyze the referential ambiguity of the scenes that co-occur with parent naming events, by showing the scenes to infants and tracking their gaze direction in free viewing. We will use the gaze data to quantify ambiguity in terms of the uncertainty, correctness, and informativeness of the scenes as to the intended object referent. We will then construct training sets for cross-situational learning experiments from the collected scenes by manipulating the mix of high and low ambiguity trials. We will test a series of hypotheses about how infants aggregate information to learn multiple object names.  Moreover, we will feed the trial-by-trial gaze data of individual infants to models to predict final learning outcomes, with the goal of specifying attentional and memory processes that support learning. Our overarching aim of the project is to show that the infant-perspective scenes co- occurring with early naming events have properties that guide and train infant visual attention and in so doing support the learning of names and their referents through the aggregation of information across multiple naming events.

"Human Face Representation in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks The human visual system can recognize a familiar face across wide variations of viewpoint, illumination, expression, and appearance. This remarkable computational feat is accomplished by large-­scale networks of neurons. We will test a face space theory of the representations that emerge at the top layer of deep learning convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as a model of human visual representations of faces. Computer-based face recognition has improved in recent years due to DCNNs and the easy availability of labeled training data (faces and identities) from the web. Inspired by the primate visual system, DCNNs are feed­forward artificial neural networks that can map images of faces into representations that support recognition over widely variable images. Although the calculations executed by the simulated neurons are simple, enormous numbers of computations are used to convert an image into a representation. The end result of this processing is a highly compact representation of a face that retains image detail in an invariant, identity­-specific face code. This code is fundamentally different than any representation of faces considered in vision science. This theory we test combines key components of previous face space models (similarity, learning history) with new features (imaging conditions, personal face history) in a unitary space that represents both identity and facial appearance across variable images. We will test whether this model can account for human recognition of familiar faces, which is highly robust to image variability (pose, illumination, expression). The model will also be applied to understanding long standing difficulties humans (and machines) have with faces of other races. We aim to bridge critical gaps in our knowledge of how DCNNs work, linking psychological, neural, and computational perspectives. A fundamentally new theory of face representation will alter the questions we ask about face representations in all three fields. A new focus on understanding how we (or neural networks) “perceive” a single familiar identity in widely variable images will give rise to a search for representations that gracefully merge the properties of faces with the real-­world image conditions in which they are experienced. This project presents a unique opportunity to study, manipulate, and learn from these representations, and to apply the findings to broader questions about high-­level vision from neural and perceptual perspectives. Human recognition of familiar faces is highly robust to image variability (pose, illumination, expression)—a skill that is likely due to the quality and quantity of experience we have with the faces of people we know well. Deep convolutional neural networks are modeled after the primate visual system and have made impressive gains recently on the problem of robust face recognition. Understanding the visual nature of the face “feature” codes that emerge in these networks can give insight into long-standing questions about how the human visual system can, but does not always, represent a face in a way that generalizes across images that vary widely.",Human Face Representation in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,9641233,R01EY029692,"['Affect', 'Appearance', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Familiarity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Published Comment', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Space Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feedforward neural network', 'feeding', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural network', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'representation theory', 'skills', 'theories', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R01,2019,387918,0.05283108228702951
"Towards a Compositional Generative Model of Human Vision Understanding object recognition has long been a central problem in vision science, because of its applied utility and computational difficulty. Progress has been slow, because of an inability to process complex natural images, where the largest challenges arise. Recently, advances in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) spurred unprecedented success in natural image recognition. The general goal of this proposal is to leverage this success to test computational theories of human object recognition in natural images. However, DCNNs still markedly underperform humans when challenged with high levels of ambiguity, occlusion, and articulation. We hypothesize that humans' superior performance arises from the use of knowledge about how images and objects are structured. Preliminary evidence for this claim comes from the success of hybrid models, that combine DCNNS for identifying features and parts in images, with explicit knowledge of object and image structure. These computations occur within a hierarchy, which includes both top-down and bottom- up processing. The specific goal of the work proposed here is to strongly test whether these computational strategies, structured, hierarchical representations and bidirectional processing, are used to recognize objects in natural images. Human bodies are composed of hierarchically organized configurable parts, making them an ideal test domain. We examine the complete recognition process, from parts, to pairs of parts, to whole bodies, each in its own aim. Each aim also tests important sub-hypotheses about when and how the computational strategies are used. Aim 1 examines recognition of individual body parts, testing whether it is dependent on parsing images into more basic features and relationships, for example edges and materials. Aim 2 examines pairs of parts, testing the importance of knowledge of body connectedness relationships. Aim 3 examines perception of entire bodies, testing whether knowledge of global body structure guides bidirectional processing. In each aim, we first develop nested computer vision models that either do or do not make use of structural knowledge, to test whether it aids recognition. We then test whether human performance can be accounted for by the availability of that structural knowledge. We next measure neural activity with functional MRI to identify where and how it is used in cortex. Finally, we integrate these results to produce even stronger tests, using the nested models to predict human performance and confusion matrices as well as fMRI activity levels and confusion matrices. Altogether, this work will strongly test key theoretical accounts of object recognition in the most important domain, perception of natural images. The work, based on extensive preliminary data, measures and models the entire body recognition system. The models developed and tested here should surpass the state-of-the-art, and be useful for many real-world recognition tasks. The proposal will also lay the groundwork for future studies of recognition impaired by disease. This research uses computational, behavioral, and brain imaging methods to investigate how the visual system represents and processes information about human bodies. The studies will reveal how and when people can accurately recognize objects in natural images, how the brain supports this function, and how loss of information, similar to that that accompanies visual disease, may affect the ability to interpret everyday scenes.",Towards a Compositional Generative Model of Human Vision,9818274,R01EY029700,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Body Image', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confusion', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elbow', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'human model', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'theories', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,352996,0.06642361261949474
"Access to parietal action representations after stroke lesions in visual cortex PROJECT SUMMARY  The ability to recognize and use objects according to their function (e.g., fork, hammer, pencil) requires integration of visual, semantic and action knowledge across occipital, temporal and parietal areas. Left parietal regions support critical aspects of object-directed action, such as grasping and object manipulation. This research activity uses a combination of fMRI and behavioral measures in patients with ischemic strokes to early and extrastriate visual areas to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1: There is a visual pathway to the parietal grasp region (aIPS) that bypasses processing in primary visual cortex. Aim 2: Left ventral extrastriate cortex is necessary to access manipulation information for visually presented objects. Aim 3A: Ballistic grasping actions to objects in the hemianopic field are influenced by volumetric properties (size, orientation) of targets. Aim 3B: Left ventral extrastriate lesions impair object function (e.g., `scissors used to cut') and disrupt access to manipulation knowledge from visual input. The research leverages strengths of fMRI (whole brain correlational measure) and neuropsychology (causal inference) to test new hypotheses about vision and action.  `Tools' (i.e., small manipulable objects) are an excellent domain in which to address broader questions about the integration of sensory, motor and cognitive processing. This is because tool recognition and tool use require the integration of distinct sensory, motor and cognitive representations, and the neural substrates of tool processing are well described. The research program emphasizes fresh perspectives on longstanding ideas about the dorsal and ventral visual pathways, by a) undertaking the first systematic investigation of the types of information about objects that are extracted by visual pathways that bypass primary visual cortex, and by b) studying how some parietal areas depend on inputs from the ventral stream in order to access the correct action for a given object. The research activity innovates by testing hypotheses about how lesions at different stages in the cortical visual hierarchy affect downstream processing in parietal cortex, combining neural and behavioral measures to study brain damaged patients (generating causal evidence), and by combining univariate and multivariate measures to `read out' the information content of brain regions (parietal cortex) that are anatomically remote from a lesion. The research advances understanding of how lesions in one brain region disrupt computations in other parts of the brain that depend on the damaged region for their inputs, a phenomenon (`dynamic diaschisis') that applies to brain injury generally. Advancing understanding of these basic issues using causal data has broad implications for understanding how the brain selects the correct action for the correct object, and more generally for theories of conceptual organization and causal reasoning. Understanding how the brain accesses actions from visual input has implications for related fields, such as robotics, neuroprosthetics, and evidenced based approaches for rehabilitating function after brain injury. Project Narrative Functional MRI and behavioral testing are used to test hypotheses about how strokes affecting occipital and temporal cortex disrupt access to action representations in parietal cortex. This research will advance understanding of how the brain processes visual information in support of everyday actions.",Access to parietal action representations after stroke lesions in visual cortex,9659002,R01EY028535,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alexia', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Ballistics', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Bypass', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Eating', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Imaging Device', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neuropsychology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'blind', 'cognitive development', 'evidence base', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'grasp', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'multisensory', 'neuroprosthesis', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual motor', 'visual object processing', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,439559,0.12717562887809458
"Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex ABSTRACT  Our long-term goal is to understand how the human brain recognizes objects. This 3-year project will characterize the computational kernel (computation that is applied independently to many parts of the image data) that is isolated by crowding experiments. We present the discovery that recognition of simple objects is performed by recognition units implementing the same computation at every eccentricity. These units are dense in the fovea and thus hard to isolate there, but they are sparse in the periphery, and easily isolated. Our fMRI & psychophysics pilot data show that each of these units, at every eccentricity, has a circular receptive field with a radius of 2.6±1.5 mm (mean±SD) in human cortical area hV4. Because of cortical magnification, that 2.6 mm corresponds to a tiny 0.05 deg in the fovea, but grows linearly with eccentricity, to a comfortable 3 deg at 10 deg eccentricity. We test this idea by pursuing its implications physiologically (Aim 1), clinically (Aim 2), and psychophysically and computationally (Aim 3).  Aim 1. Better noninvasive measures for the health and development of visual cortex are needed. Conservation of crowding distance (in mm) in a particular cortical area (hV4) would validate crowding distance as a quick, noninvasive measure of that area's condition. Aim 2. Huge public interventions seek to help dyslexic children read faster and identify amblyopic children sooner. It would be valuable to know whether crowding contributes to reading problems and provides a basis for effective screening for dyslexia and amblyopia, as it can be measured before children learn to read. Aim 3. Documenting conservation of efficiency gives evidence that the same universal computation recognizes objects at every eccentricity. We are testing the first computational model of object recognition that accounts for many human characteristics of simple-object recognition. The new work extends to effect of receptive field size and learning. Project Narrative (relevance to public health) This proposal is a collaboration between a psychophysicist, expert on human object recognition, a computer scientist, expert on machine learning for object recognition by computers, and a brain imager, expert on brain mapping, to discover to what extent computer models of object recognition and the brain can account for key properties of human performance. Our first aim tracks the development of crowding in normal and amblyopic children, in collaboration with experts in optometry, reading, and development. Advances in this area could shed light on the problems of people with impaired object recognition, including amblyopia and dyslexia, with a potential for development of early pre-literate screening tests for amblyopia and risk of dyslexia.",Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex,9637403,R01EY027964,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amblyopia', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Bypass', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nose', 'Occipital lobe', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Reading', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rome', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'assault', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'imager', 'literate', 'object recognition', 'physiologic model', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'vision development']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,388812,0.09101791112727176
"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9653180,R01EY025332,"['3-Dimensional', 'Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,416574,0.036112587873681275
"Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex. Project Summary How is the representation of complex visual objects organized in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the large brain region responsible for object recognition? To date, areas selective for a few categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found, but the vast majority of IT cortex is “wild,” lacking any known specialization. Various schemes have been proposed for parceling IT, but a comprehensive understanding of IT organization remains elusive. Here, we propose to use fMRI, microstimulation, and electrophysiology to develop a unified understanding of the organization and coding principles of macaque IT. The experiments are motivated by a major advance in computer vision and two key preliminary results from our lab. First, the advent of deep networks trained for object classification makes it possible to generate a parametric object space, providing a quantitative framework to decipher the feature selectivity of single IT cells. Second, our preliminary results suggest that a large portion of macaque IT cortex is topographically organized according to the first two principal components of object space. This topography encompasses at least four distinct networks, each with at least three hierarchical nodes of increasing view invariance, and includes the previously described face and body patch networks. Furthermore, single cells within each network are projecting incoming objects, formatted as vectors in the object space, onto specific preferred axes. Taken together, these results suggest a new hypothesis for IT organization: IT cortex is tiled by networks (i.e., sets of functionally connected nodes, where a node is a patch of IT cells) whose organization and coding principles are very similar to that of the face patch network, and the layout of these networks follows a regular topography specified by the statistical structure of object space. We propose three Specific Aims to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will systematically map all networks within IT of individual animals. In Aim 2, we will record responses of cells in each identified network to a large, common set of object stimuli and determine their coding scheme. In Aim 3, we will perturb activity in each network and quantitatively assess effect on object recognition behavior. Together, these three Aims seek to build a comprehensive understanding of IT organization that bridges fMRI, single units, and behavior. Our lab has developed powerful experimental techniques to tackle each of these Aims and has previously applied them to the macaque face patch system. We believe the time is ripe to apply these techniques to the larger problem of how all objects are represented--not just faces. In the same way that Mendeleev’s arrangement of chemical elements according to their atomic mass and chemical properties helped elucidate the electronic structure of atoms, we believe systematic mapping and characterization of all networks in IT will help elucidate the fundamental neural mechanism for object recognition. Narrative This basic research application will investigate how visual objects are processed by the brain. The brain areas we will study are located in the temporal lobe, a brain region especially susceptible to neurological disease including Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. The planned studies will provide valuable insight into the fundamental code cells in this region use to represent visual information, and will thereby contribute to better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases targeting this part of the brain.",Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex.,9803682,R01EY030650,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glean', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Macaca', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monkeys', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'chemical property', 'electronic structure', 'experimental study', 'inferotemporal cortex', 'insight', 'microstimulation', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'vector', 'visual information']",NEI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,575750,0.09187772475639298
"Cortical computations underlying binocular motion integration PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Neuroscience is highly specialized—even visual submodalities such as motion, depth, form and color processing are often studied in isolation. One disadvantage of this isolation is that results from each subfield are not brought together to constrain common underlying neural circuitry. Yet, to understand the cortical computations that support vision, it is important to unify our fragmentary models that capture isolated insights across visual submodalities so that all relevant experimental and theoretical efforts can benefit from the most powerful and robust models that can be achieved. This proposal aims to take the first concrete step in that direction by unifying models of direction selectivity, binocular disparity selectivity and 3D motion selectivity (also known as motion-in-depth) to reveal circuits and understand computations from V1 to area MT. Motion in 3D inherently bridges visual submodalities, necessitating the integration of motion and binocular processing, and we are motivated by two recent paradigm-breaking physiological studies that have shown that area MT has a robust representation of 3D motion. In Aim 1, we will create the first unified model and understanding of the relationship between pattern and 3D motion in MT. In Aim 2, we will construct the first unified model of motion and disparity processing in MT. In Aim 3, we will develop a large-scale biologically plausible model of these selectivities that represents realistic response distributions across an MT population. Having a population output that is complete enough to represent widely-used visual stimuli will amplify our ability to link to population read-out theories and to link to results from psychophysical studies of visual perception. Key elements of our approach are (1) an iterative loop between modeling and electrophysiological experiments; (2) building a set of shared models, stimuli, data and analysis tools in a cloud-based system that unifies efforts across labs, creating opportunities for deep collaboration between labs that specialize in relevant submodalities, and encouraging all interested scientists to contribute and benefit; (3) using model-driven experiments to answer open, inter-related questions that involve motion and binocular processing, including motion opponency, spatial integration, binocular integration and the timely problem of how 3D motion is represented in area MT; (4) unifying insights from filter-based models and conceptual, i.e., non-image- computable, models to generate the first large-scale spiking hierarchical circuits that predict and explain how correlated signals and noise are transformed across multiple cortical stages to carry out essential visual computations; and (5) carrying out novel simultaneous recordings across visual areas. This research also has potential long-term benefits in medicine and technology. It will build fundamental knowledge about functional cortical circuitry that someday may be useful for interpreting dysfunctions of the cortex or for helping biomedical engineers construct devices to interface to the brain. Insights gained from the visual cortex may also help to advance computer vision technology. NARRATIVE The processing of visual motion and depth information is essential for a wide variety of important human abilities, including navigating through the world, avoiding collisions, catching and grabbing objects and interpreting complex scenes. To understand how neurons in the visual cortex transform and represent the information that underlies these abilities, we aim to initiate the development of a more complete, biologically constrained and openly available computer model of motion and depth processing that will be used to guide, and to interpret and incorporate results from, primate visual neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments. Gaining an understanding of the normal function of cortical neural circuitry is an important step in building the fundamental knowledge that someday may help to improve the ability to assess dysfunctions of the cortex and may help bioengineers create devices that interface to cortical circuitry to treat disorders and overcome disabilities.",Cortical computations underlying binocular motion integration,9727981,R01EY027023,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Production', 'Psychophysics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Motion', 'Visual Perception', 'area MT', 'base', 'cloud based', 'color processing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fitness', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial integration', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual neuroscience', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,399500,0.0815794382837277
"Environmental Localization Mapping and Guidance for Visual Prosthesis Users Project Summary About 1.3 million Americans aged 40 and older are legally blind, a majority because of diseases with onset later in life, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Second Sight has developed the world's first FDA approved retinal implant, Argus II, intended to restore some functional vision for people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In this era of smart devices, generic navigation technology, such as GPS mapping apps for smartphones, can provide directions to help guide a blind user from point A to point B. However, these navigational aids do little to enable blind users to form an egocentric understanding of the surroundings, are not suited to navigation indoors, and do nothing to assist in avoiding obstacles to mobility. The Argus II, on the other hand, provides blind users with a limited visual representation of their surroundings that improves users' ability to orient themselves and traverse obstacles, yet lacks features for high-level navigation and semantic interpretation of the surroundings. The proposed research aims to address these limitations of the Argus II through a synergy of state-of-the-art stimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object recognition technologies. For the past three years, JHU/APL has collaborated with Second Sight to develop similar advanced vision-based capabilities for the Argus II, including capabilities for object recognition and obstacle detection by stereo vision. This proposal is driven by the hypothesis that navigation for users of retinal prosthetics can be greatly improved by incorporating SLAM and object recognition technology conveying environmental information via a retinal prosthesis and auditory feedback. SLAM enables the visual prosthesis system to construct a map of the user's environment and locate the user within that map. The system then provides object location and navigational cues via appropriate sensory modalities enabling the user to mentally form an egocentric map of the environment. We propose to develop and test a visual prosthesis system which 1) constructs a map of unfamiliar environments and localizes the user using SLAM technology 2) automatically identifies navigationally-relevant objects and landmarks using object recognition and 3) provides sensory feedback for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and object/landmark identification. Project Narrative The proposed system, when realized, will use advanced simultaneous localization and mapping, and object recognition techniques, to enable visual prosthesis users with unprecedented abilities to autonomously navigate and identify objects/landmarks in unfamiliar environments.",Environmental Localization Mapping and Guidance for Visual Prosthesis Users,9818350,R01EY029741,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Medical Device', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Ocular Prosthesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Retinitis Pigmentosa', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Volition', 'aged', 'auditory feedback', 'base', 'behavior test', 'blind', 'cognitive load', 'falls', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'legally blind', 'navigation aid', 'object recognition', 'portability', 'prosthesis wearer', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'retina implantation', 'retinal prosthesis', 'sensory feedback', 'smartphone Application', 'synergism', 'visual feedback', 'visual information']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,641060,0.050037242259945346
"CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian PROJECT DESCRIPTION  Collaborating Pis and Consultant  United States  Pl: Anitha Pasupathy, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA  Co-Pl: Wyeth Bair, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA Japan  Pl: lsamu Motoyoshi, Dept. of Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan  Consultant: Hidehiko Komatsu, Tamagawa University, Japan  Specific Aims  Our visual system endows us with a diverse set of abilities: to recognize and manipulate  objects, avoid obstacles and danger during navigation, evaluate the quality of food, read text,  interpret facial expressions, etc. This relies on the neuronal processing of information about  form and material texture along the ventral pathway of the primate visual system (Ungerleider &  Mishkin, 1982; Felleman & Van Essen, 1991). Studies over the past several decades have  produced detailed models of how visual information is processed in V1, the earliest stage along . this pathway (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1968; Movshon et al., 1978a, b; Albrecht et al., 1980), but  beyond V1 our understanding of visual processing and representation is limited. This is  particularly true with regard to our understanding of how visual representations of form and  texture jointly contribute to object perception and recognition. The broad goal of this proposal is  two-fold-to develop an experimentally-driven image-computable model for how naturalistic  visual stimuli are processed in area V4, an important intermediate stage along the ventral visual  pathway (Aim 1) and to discover how such a representation contributes to perception (Aim 2).  Past studies have shown that V4 neurons are sensitive to both the form (Desimone and Schein,  1987; Kobatake and Tanaka, 1994; Gallant et al., 1993; Pasupathy and Connor, 2001; Nandy et  al., 2013) and the surface texture of visual stimuli (Arcizet et al., 2008; Goda et al., 2014;  Okazawa et al., 2015). But, because expertise is narrow and experimental time limited,  scientists tend to focus exclusively on the encoding of form or texture and not on their joint  coding. For example, in the laboratories of the USA portion of this collaboration, we have until  now focused on form processing by carrying out neurophysiological studies using 2D shapes  with uniform surface properties to investigate how object boundaries are encoded (Oleskiw et  al., 2014; Popovkina et al., 2016). We have modeled our data by comparing the representation  of V4 neurons to that of the units in AlexNet (Pospisil et al., 2015), a prominent convolutional  neural net (CNN) trained to recognize objects (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). At the same time, the  Japanese contingent of this collaboration has investigated the encoding of surface texture and  gloss in human perception without associated form encoding (Motoyoshi et al., 2007; Sharan et  al., 2008; Motoyoshi, 2010; Motoyoshi & Matoba, 2012). Here we propose to bring our  respective expertise in studying form and texture encoding to bear on the question of how  naturalistic stimuli with both form and surface cues are encoded in area V4 and how these  representations support human visual perception. Our specific aims are:  Aim1. To build a unified image-computable model for neuronal responses to shapes and  textures in area V4  V4 responses to 2D shapes with uniform luminance/chromatic characteristics can be explained  by a hierarchical-Max (HMax) model for object recognition that emphasizes boundary features  (Cadieu et al., 2007). Such responses can also be explained by units in artificial deep  convolutional networks, in which boundary features are not explicitly emphasized (all features  are learned from initially random weights). On the other hand, V4 responses to texture patches  can be well explained by a higher-order image-statistics-based model (Okazawa et al., 2015).  Using shape data from the Pasupathy lab and texture data from the Komatsu lab (Japanese  consultant), we will ask whether responses of V4 neurons to shapes and textures can be Page 21 n/a",CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian,9765318,R01EY029997,"['Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Facial Expression', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Japan', 'Japanese Population', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'Text', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tokyo', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'V4 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'area V4', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'experimental study', 'food quality', 'human model', 'human subject', 'information processing', 'luminance', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'response', 'statistics', 'visual information', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,230475,0.12230596452170125
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion.

"Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing Project Summary The goal of this project is to test a novel theoretical framework for understanding how the ventral pathway subserves object vision. In the standard framework, a series of neural operations on 2D image data through many intermediate cortical stages, including area V4, leads to high-level perceptual representations, including representation of object identity, at the final stages of the ventral pathway. However, our preliminary microelectrode data from a fixating monkey show that many neurons in V4 represent volumetric (volume- enclosing) 3D shape, not 2D image patterns. These neurons respond to many different 2D images that convey the same 3D shape with different shape-in-depth cues, including shading, reflection, and refraction. They even respond preferentially to random dot stereograms that convey 3D volumetric shape with no 2D cues whatsoever. Moreover, our preliminary results with 2-photon functional imaging in anesthetized monkey V4 show that 3D shape signals are grouped by their similarity, and also group with isomorphic (same outline) 2D shape signals (which could contribute evidence to corresponding 3D shape inferences). We propose to capitalize on these preliminary data by demonstrating the prevalence of 3D shape tuning in area V4, analyzing the 3D shape coding strategies used by these neurons, and measuring how 2D and 3D shape signals are arranged at a microscopic level across the surface of V4. We expect these results to provide strong evidence that extraction of 3D shape fragments is a primary goal of V4 processing. This early extraction of 3D shape information, just two synapses beyond primary visual cortex, would suggest a competing framework for understanding the ventral pathway, in which the initial goal is to represent 3D physical structure, independent of the various 2D image cues used to infer it. In this framework, object recognition would be based on preceding information about 3D physical structure, which would explain why human object recognition is so robust to image changes, in a way that the best computational vision systems are not. The scientific impact of this work would be to divert vision experiments toward understanding representation of real world 3D structure (rather than 2D planar stimuli) and to encourage computational vision scientists to incorporate early 3D shape processing into the deep convolutional network models that are the current state of the art. Narrative This study will help explain how the human brain achieves such remarkably robust perception of visual objects. The results will help guide future rehabilitative and prosthetic strategies for patients with visual impairments, by elucidating neural strategies that could be used to bring computer vision prosthetics up to human performance levels, and by discovering specific neural signals for object information that could be replicated by electrode array implants in higher-level visual cortex.",Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing,9773064,R01EY029420,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Microelectrodes', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Ocular Prosthesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'area V4', 'area striata', 'base', 'experimental study', 'individual response', 'network models', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'three dimensional structure', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality', 'visual object processing']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,548567,0.07671382646555973
"The nGoggle: A portable brain-based device for assessment of visual function deficits PROJECT SUMMARY Assessment of loss of visual function outside the foveal area is an essential component of the management of numerous conditions, including glaucoma, retinal and neurological disorders. Despite the significant progress achieved with the development of standard automated perimetry (SAP) many decades ago, assessment of visual field loss with SAP still has significant drawbacks. SAP testing is limited by subjectivity of patient responses and high test-retest variability, frequently requiring many tests for effective detection of change over time. Moreover, as these tests are generally conducted in clinic-based settings, limited patient availability and health care resources often result in an insufficient number of tests acquired over time, with delayed diagnosis and detection of disease progression. The requirement for highly trained technicians, cost, complexity, and lack of portability of SAP also preclude its use for screening of visual field loss in underserved populations. To address shortcomings of current methods to assess visual function, we have developed the nGoggle, a wearable device that uses a head-mounted display (HMD) integrated with wireless electroencephalography (EEG), capable of objectively assessing visual field deficits using multifocal steady-state visual-evoked potentials (mfSSVEP). As part of the funded NEI SBIR Phase I, we developed the nGoggle prototype using a modified smartphone-based HMD display and non-disposable electrodes. In our Phase I studies, we conducted benchmarking tests on signal quality of EEG acquisition, developed methods for EEG data extraction and analysis, and conducted a pilot study demonstrating the ability of the device to detect visual field loss in glaucoma, a progressive neuropathy that results in characteristic damage to the optic nerve and resulting visual field defects. We also identified limitations of current existing displays and electrodes, as well as potential avenues for enhancing test reliability and improving user interface. Based on the encouraging results from Phase I and a clear delineation of the steps needed to bring the device into its final commercial product form, we now propose a series of Phase II studies. We hypothesize that optimization of nGoggle's accuracy and repeatability in detecting visual function loss can be achieved through the development of a customized head-mounted display with front-view eye/pupil tracking cameras and disposable no-prep electrodes, as well as enhancement of the visual stimulation protocol and data analytics. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To develop a customized head-mounted display and enhanced no-prep electrodes for improving nGoggle's ability to acquire users' mfSSVEP with high signal-to- noise ratios (SNR) in response to visual stimulation; 2) To optimize and validate mfSSVEP stimuli design and data analytics to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of assessing visual function loss with the nGoggle. 3) Complete pivotal clinical studies to support FDA approval.

"Representation of information across the human visual cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human visual system is organized as a parallel, hierarchical network, and successive stages of visual processing appear to represent increasingly complicated aspects of shape-related and semantic information. However, the way that shape-related and semantic information is represented across much of the visual hierarchy is still poorly understood. The primary goal of this proposal is to understand how information about object shape and semantic category is represented explicitly across mid- and high-level visual areas. To address this important issue we propose to undertake a series of human functional MRI (fMRI) studies, using both synthetic and natural movies. Data will be analyzed by means of a powerful voxel-wise modeling (VM) approach that has been developed in my laboratory over the past several years. In Aim 1 we propose to measure human brain activity evoked by synthetic naturalistic movies, and to use VM to evaluate and compare several competing theories of shape representation across the entire visual cortex. In Aim 2 we propose to use VM to evaluate and compare competing theories of semantic representation. In Aim 3 we propose to use machine learning and and VM to discover new aspects of shape and semantic representation. These experiments will provide fundamental new insights about the representation of visual information across visual cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disorders of central vision can severely affect quality of life and the design of treatments and devices for improving visual function will depend critically on understanding the organization of visual cortex. We propose to use functional MRI and sophisticated computational data analysis and modeling procedures to evaluate and compare multiple theories of visual function. The results will reveal how visual information is represented across the several dozen distinct functional areas that constitute human visual cortex.",Representation of information across the human visual cortex,9542335,R01EY019684,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'V2 neuron', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'area striata', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'movie', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'object shape', 'public health relevance', 'receptive field', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'visual processing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,376543,0.1229839036086883
"What you see is what you learn: Visual attention in statistical word learning PROJECT SUMMARY Individual differences in the quantity and quality of parent talk and individual differences in infant visual attention predict later vocabulary development, which in turn has the cascading consequences of later cognitive development and school achievement. The proposed research studies how infants prior to their first birthday begin to learn object names, and does so in a unique approach, focusing on how visual information from the infant perspective coincide with parent naming and on how infant looking behavior selects the data to be aggregated and how that selected data changes incrementally in statistical learning. Toward this goal, we will collect a corpus of infant-perspective scenes from 8-12-month-old infants as they play with their parent in a toy room and as parents naturally name objects during play. We will analyze the referential ambiguity of the scenes that co-occur with parent naming events, by showing the scenes to infants and tracking their gaze direction in free viewing. We will use the gaze data to quantify ambiguity in terms of the uncertainty, correctness, and informativeness of the scenes as to the intended object referent. We will then construct training sets for cross-situational learning experiments from the collected scenes by manipulating the mix of high and low ambiguity trials. We will test a series of hypotheses about how infants aggregate information to learn multiple object names.  Moreover, we will feed the trial-by-trial gaze data of individual infants to models to predict final learning outcomes, with the goal of specifying attentional and memory processes that support learning. Our overarching aim of the project is to show that the infant-perspective scenes co- occurring with early naming events have properties that guide and train infant visual attention and in so doing support the learning of names and their referents through the aggregation of information across multiple naming events.

"Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex ABSTRACT  Our long-term goal is to understand how the human brain recognizes objects. This 3-year project will characterize the computational kernel (computation that is applied independently to many parts of the image data) that is isolated by crowding experiments. We present the discovery that recognition of simple objects is performed by recognition units implementing the same computation at every eccentricity. These units are dense in the fovea and thus hard to isolate there, but they are sparse in the periphery, and easily isolated. Our fMRI & psychophysics pilot data show that each of these units, at every eccentricity, has a circular receptive field with a radius of 2.6±1.5 mm (mean±SD) in human cortical area hV4. Because of cortical magnification, that 2.6 mm corresponds to a tiny 0.05 deg in the fovea, but grows linearly with eccentricity, to a comfortable 3 deg at 10 deg eccentricity. We test this idea by pursuing its implications physiologically (Aim 1), clinically (Aim 2), and psychophysically and computationally (Aim 3).  Aim 1. Better noninvasive measures for the health and development of visual cortex are needed. Conservation of crowding distance (in mm) in a particular cortical area (hV4) would validate crowding distance as a quick, noninvasive measure of that area's condition. Aim 2. Huge public interventions seek to help dyslexic children read faster and identify amblyopic children sooner. It would be valuable to know whether crowding contributes to reading problems and provides a basis for effective screening for dyslexia and amblyopia, as it can be measured before children learn to read. Aim 3. Documenting conservation of efficiency gives evidence that the same universal computation recognizes objects at every eccentricity. We are testing the first computational model of object recognition that accounts for many human characteristics of simple-object recognition. The new work extends to effect of receptive field size and learning. Project Narrative (relevance to public health) This proposal is a collaboration between a psychophysicist, expert on human object recognition, a computer scientist, expert on machine learning for object recognition by computers, and a brain imager, expert on brain mapping, to discover to what extent computer models of object recognition and the brain can account for key properties of human performance. Our first aim tracks the development of crowding in normal and amblyopic children, in collaboration with experts in optometry, reading, and development. Advances in this area could shed light on the problems of people with impaired object recognition, including amblyopia and dyslexia, with a potential for development of early pre-literate screening tests for amblyopia and risk of dyslexia.",Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex,9455331,R01EY027964,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amblyopia', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Bypass', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nose', 'Occipital lobe', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Reading', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rome', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'assault', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'crowdsourcing', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'imager', 'literate', 'object recognition', 'physiologic model', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'vision development']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,388993,0.09101791112727176
"The nGoggle: A portable brain-based device for assessment of visual function deficits PROJECT SUMMARY Assessment of loss of visual function outside the foveal area is an essential component of the management of numerous conditions, including glaucoma, retinal and neurological disorders. Despite the significant progress achieved with the development of standard automated perimetry (SAP) many decades ago, assessment of visual field loss with SAP still has significant drawbacks. SAP testing is limited by subjectivity of patient responses and high test-retest variability, frequently requiring many tests for effective detection of change over time. Moreover, as these tests are generally conducted in clinic-based settings, limited patient availability and health care resources often result in an insufficient number of tests acquired over time, with delayed diagnosis and detection of disease progression. The requirement for highly trained technicians, cost, complexity, and lack of portability of SAP also preclude its use for screening of visual field loss in underserved populations. To address shortcomings of current methods to assess visual function, we have developed the nGoggle, a wearable device that uses a head-mounted display (HMD) integrated with wireless electroencephalography (EEG), capable of objectively assessing visual field deficits using multifocal steady-state visual-evoked potentials (mfSSVEP). As part of the funded NEI SBIR Phase I, we developed the nGoggle prototype using a modified smartphone-based HMD display and non-disposable electrodes. In our Phase I studies, we conducted benchmarking tests on signal quality of EEG acquisition, developed methods for EEG data extraction and analysis, and conducted a pilot study demonstrating the ability of the device to detect visual field loss in glaucoma, a progressive neuropathy that results in characteristic damage to the optic nerve and resulting visual field defects. We also identified limitations of current existing displays and electrodes, as well as potential avenues for enhancing test reliability and improving user interface. Based on the encouraging results from Phase I and a clear delineation of the steps needed to bring the device into its final commercial product form, we now propose a series of Phase II studies. We hypothesize that optimization of nGoggle's accuracy and repeatability in detecting visual function loss can be achieved through the development of a customized head-mounted display with front-view eye/pupil tracking cameras and disposable no-prep electrodes, as well as enhancement of the visual stimulation protocol and data analytics. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To develop a customized head-mounted display and enhanced no-prep electrodes for improving nGoggle's ability to acquire users' mfSSVEP with high signal-to- noise ratios (SNR) in response to visual stimulation; 2) To optimize and validate mfSSVEP stimuli design and data analytics to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of assessing visual function loss with the nGoggle. 3) Complete pivotal clinical studies to support FDA approval.

"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9438535,R01EY025332,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,416574,0.036112587873681275
"Post-natal development of high-level visual representation in primates View-invariant object recognition is a complex cognitive task that is critical to everyday functioning. A key neural correlate of high-level object recognition is inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a brain area present in both humans and non-human primates. Recent advances in visual systems neuroscience have begun to uncover how images are encoded in the adult IT object representation, however the learning rules by which high level visual areas (especially IT) develop remain mysterious, with both the magnitude and qualitative nature of developmental changes remaining almost completely unknown — in part because, over the last thirty years, there have been practically no studies of spiking neural responses in the higher ventral cortical areas of developing primates. There is thus a significant gap in our understanding of how visual development proceeds.  This exploratory proposal aims to characterize how representation in higher primate visual cortex changes during development. We first aim (Aim 1) to implant chronic electrode arrays to record hundreds of IT neuronal sites in response to thousands of image stimuli in awake behaving juvenile macaques. These data will comprise a snapshot of the developing primate visual representation, and will be particularly powerful because we have already extensively measured adult monkey IT using the same stimuli and methods. By comparing juvenile and adult neuronal responses at both single site and population levels, we will obtain a unprecedentedly large-scale and detailed picture of the neural correlates of high-level visual development (Aim 2).  Aims 1 and 2 are exploratory, but potentially transformative – they will result in publicly available neuronal IT development benchmarks against which any proposed model of high level visual development can be rigorously tested, and will spur the development of those models in our lab and others. In that context, we will also seek (Aim 3) to improve known semi- and un-supervised learning rules from the computer vision and computational neuroscience literature, and to compare them to both recent high-performing (but biologically implausible) supervised models as well to the rich developmental measurements obtained in Aims 1 and 2.  Establishing experimental and surgical procedures for juvenile array recordings will create the future opportunity to observe changes in high level neural visual representations while experience is manipulated in early development, and will enable experiments in other sensory, motor, or decision making domains. If successful, the proposed work will yield a deeper understanding of the principles underlying visual cortex development, understanding which will in turn be helpful for treating neurodevelopmental disorders that implicate cortical circuits, including amblyopia and autism. Project narrative  Visual object recognition is fundamental to our everyday functioning. While the brain is remarkably good at accomplishing these challenging tasks, we do not yet know how it learns this ability during development. The goal of these experiments is to develop new experimental and computational tools to discover the neural learning principles that underlie that visual ability.",Post-natal development of high-level visual representation in primates,9455686,R21EY025863,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amblyopia', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Inferior', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'cognitive task', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'improved', 'juvenile animal', 'learning network', 'mature animal', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'network models', 'neural correlate', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'vision development']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2018,232050,0.1267564597662795
"Cortical computations underlying binocular motion integration PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Neuroscience is highly specialized—even visual submodalities such as motion, depth, form and color processing are often studied in isolation. One disadvantage of this isolation is that results from each subfield are not brought together to constrain common underlying neural circuitry. Yet, to understand the cortical computations that support vision, it is important to unify our fragmentary models that capture isolated insights across visual submodalities so that all relevant experimental and theoretical efforts can benefit from the most powerful and robust models that can be achieved. This proposal aims to take the first concrete step in that direction by unifying models of direction selectivity, binocular disparity selectivity and 3D motion selectivity (also known as motion-in-depth) to reveal circuits and understand computations from V1 to area MT. Motion in 3D inherently bridges visual submodalities, necessitating the integration of motion and binocular processing, and we are motivated by two recent paradigm-breaking physiological studies that have shown that area MT has a robust representation of 3D motion. In Aim 1, we will create the first unified model and understanding of the relationship between pattern and 3D motion in MT. In Aim 2, we will construct the first unified model of motion and disparity processing in MT. In Aim 3, we will develop a large-scale biologically plausible model of these selectivities that represents realistic response distributions across an MT population. Having a population output that is complete enough to represent widely-used visual stimuli will amplify our ability to link to population read-out theories and to link to results from psychophysical studies of visual perception. Key elements of our approach are (1) an iterative loop between modeling and electrophysiological experiments; (2) building a set of shared models, stimuli, data and analysis tools in a cloud-based system that unifies efforts across labs, creating opportunities for deep collaboration between labs that specialize in relevant submodalities, and encouraging all interested scientists to contribute and benefit; (3) using model-driven experiments to answer open, inter-related questions that involve motion and binocular processing, including motion opponency, spatial integration, binocular integration and the timely problem of how 3D motion is represented in area MT; (4) unifying insights from filter-based models and conceptual, i.e., non-image- computable, models to generate the first large-scale spiking hierarchical circuits that predict and explain how correlated signals and noise are transformed across multiple cortical stages to carry out essential visual computations; and (5) carrying out novel simultaneous recordings across visual areas. This research also has potential long-term benefits in medicine and technology. It will build fundamental knowledge about functional cortical circuitry that someday may be useful for interpreting dysfunctions of the cortex or for helping biomedical engineers construct devices to interface to the brain. Insights gained from the visual cortex may also help to advance computer vision technology. NARRATIVE The processing of visual motion and depth information is essential for a wide variety of important human abilities, including navigating through the world, avoiding collisions, catching and grabbing objects and interpreting complex scenes. To understand how neurons in the visual cortex transform and represent the information that underlies these abilities, we aim to initiate the development of a more complete, biologically constrained and openly available computer model of motion and depth processing that will be used to guide, and to interpret and incorporate results from, primate visual neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments. Gaining an understanding of the normal function of cortical neural circuitry is an important step in building the fundamental knowledge that someday may help to improve the ability to assess dysfunctions of the cortex and may help bioengineers create devices that interface to cortical circuitry to treat disorders and overcome disabilities.",Cortical computations underlying binocular motion integration,9567839,R01EY027023,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Production', 'Psychophysics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Motion', 'Visual Perception', 'area MT', 'base', 'cloud based', 'color processing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fitness', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial integration', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual neuroscience', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,413375,0.0815794382837277
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion. This lack of integrative research limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, this proposal develops an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world.",GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN,9527525,K99EY028229,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Image', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Nature', 'Neuromechanics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Posture', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'area MST', 'area MT', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'foot', 'gaze', 'insight', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuromechanism', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'optic flow', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'skills', 'statistics', 'treadmill', 'treatment planning', 'visual control', 'visual information', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-motor integration']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K99,2018,121770,0.06621942414222817
"CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian PROJECT DESCRIPTION  Collaborating Pis and Consultant  United States  Pl: Anitha Pasupathy, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA  Co-Pl: Wyeth Bair, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA Japan  Pl: lsamu Motoyoshi, Dept. of Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan  Consultant: Hidehiko Komatsu, Tamagawa University, Japan  Specific Aims  Our visual system endows us with a diverse set of abilities: to recognize and manipulate  objects, avoid obstacles and danger during navigation, evaluate the quality of food, read text,  interpret facial expressions, etc. This relies on the neuronal processing of information about  form and material texture along the ventral pathway of the primate visual system (Ungerleider &  Mishkin, 1982; Felleman & Van Essen, 1991). Studies over the past several decades have  produced detailed models of how visual information is processed in V1, the earliest stage along . this pathway (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1968; Movshon et al., 1978a, b; Albrecht et al., 1980), but  beyond V1 our understanding of visual processing and representation is limited. This is  particularly true with regard to our understanding of how visual representations of form and  texture jointly contribute to object perception and recognition. The broad goal of this proposal is  two-fold-to develop an experimentally-driven image-computable model for how naturalistic  visual stimuli are processed in area V4, an important intermediate stage along the ventral visual  pathway (Aim 1) and to discover how such a representation contributes to perception (Aim 2).  Past studies have shown that V4 neurons are sensitive to both the form (Desimone and Schein,  1987; Kobatake and Tanaka, 1994; Gallant et al., 1993; Pasupathy and Connor, 2001; Nandy et  al., 2013) and the surface texture of visual stimuli (Arcizet et al., 2008; Goda et al., 2014;  Okazawa et al., 2015). But, because expertise is narrow and experimental time limited,  scientists tend to focus exclusively on the encoding of form or texture and not on their joint  coding. For example, in the laboratories of the USA portion of this collaboration, we have until  now focused on form processing by carrying out neurophysiological studies using 2D shapes  with uniform surface properties to investigate how object boundaries are encoded (Oleskiw et  al., 2014; Popovkina et al., 2016). We have modeled our data by comparing the representation  of V4 neurons to that of the units in AlexNet (Pospisil et al., 2015), a prominent convolutional  neural net (CNN) trained to recognize objects (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). At the same time, the  Japanese contingent of this collaboration has investigated the encoding of surface texture and  gloss in human perception without associated form encoding (Motoyoshi et al., 2007; Sharan et  al., 2008; Motoyoshi, 2010; Motoyoshi & Matoba, 2012). Here we propose to bring our  respective expertise in studying form and texture encoding to bear on the question of how  naturalistic stimuli with both form and surface cues are encoded in area V4 and how these  representations support human visual perception. Our specific aims are:  Aim1. To build a unified image-computable model for neuronal responses to shapes and  textures in area V4  V4 responses to 2D shapes with uniform luminance/chromatic characteristics can be explained  by a hierarchical-Max (HMax) model for object recognition that emphasizes boundary features  (Cadieu et al., 2007). Such responses can also be explained by units in artificial deep  convolutional networks, in which boundary features are not explicitly emphasized (all features  are learned from initially random weights). On the other hand, V4 responses to texture patches  can be well explained by a higher-order image-statistics-based model (Okazawa et al., 2015).  Using shape data from the Pasupathy lab and texture data from the Komatsu lab (Japanese  consultant), we will ask whether responses of V4 neurons to shapes and textures can be Page 21 n/a",CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian,9692119,R01EY029997,"['Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Facial Expression', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Japan', 'Japanese Population', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'Text', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tokyo', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'V4 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'area V4', 'base', 'experimental study', 'food quality', 'human model', 'human subject', 'information processing', 'luminance', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'visual information', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,263433,0.12230596452170125
"The role of area V4 in the perception and recognition of visual objects ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human visual system parses the information that reaches our eyes into a meaningful arrangement of regions and objects. This process, called image segmentation, is one of the most challenging computations accomplished by the primate brain. To discover its neural basis we will study neuronal processes in two brain areas in the macaque monkey-V4, a fundamental stage of form processing along the occipito-temporal pathway, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), important for executive control. Dysfunctions of both areas impair shape discrimination behavior in displays that require the identification of segmented objects, strongly suggesting that they are important for image segmentation. Our experimental techniques will include single and multielectrode recordings, behavioral manipulations, perturbation methods and computer models. In Aim 1 we will identify the neural signals that reflect segmentation in visual cortex. Using a variety of parametric stimuli with occlusion, clutter and shadows-stimulus features known to challenge segmentation in natural vision-we will evaluate whether segmentation is achieved by grouping regions with similar surface properties, such as surface color, texture and depth, or by grouping contour segments that are likely to form the boundary of an object or some interplay between these two strategies. We will test the hypothesis that contour grouping mechanisms are most effective under low clutter and close to the fovea. In Aim 2, we will investigate how feedback from PFC modulates shape responses in V4 and facilitates segmentation: we will test the longstanding hypothesis that object recognition in higher cortical stages precedes and facilitates segmentation in the midlevels of visual form processing. We will simultaneously study populations of V4 and PFC neurons while animals engage in shape discrimination behavior. We will use single-trial decoding methods and correlation analyses to relate the content and timing of neuronal responses in the two areas. To causally test the role of feedback from PFC, we will reversibly inactivate PFC by cooling and study V4 neurons. Our results will provide the first detailed, analytical models of V4 neuronal response dynamics in the presence of occlusion and clutter and advance our understanding of how complex visual scenes are processed in area V4. They will also reveal how V4 and PFC together mediate performance on a complex shape discrimination task, how executive function and midlevel vision may be coordinated during behavior and how feedback is used in cortical computation. Object recognition is impaired in visual agnosia, a dysfunction of the occipito-temporal pathway, and in dysfunctions of the PFC (e.g. schizophrenia). Results from these experiments will constitute a major advance in our understanding of the brain computations that underlie segmentation and object recognition and will bring us closer to devising strategies to alleviate and treat brain disorders in which these capacities are impaired. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A fundamental capacity of the primate visual system is its ability to segment visual scenes into component objects and then recognize those objects regardless of partial occlusions and clutter. Using a combination of primate neurophysiology experiments, computational modeling, animal behavior and reversible inactivation methods, we hope to achieve a new level of understanding about visual processing in the context of object recognition; these findings will ultimately bring us closer to devising strategies to alleviate and treat brain disorders of impaired object recognition resulting from dysfunctions in the occipito-temporal pathway (e.g. agnosia) and the prefrontal cortex (e.g. schizophrenia).",The role of area V4 in the perception and recognition of visual objects,9462122,R01EY018839,"['Agnosia', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Discrimination', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Lesion', 'Macaca', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Agnosias', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'area V4', 'awake', 'base', 'design', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'fovea centralis', 'imaging Segmentation', 'impaired capacity', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'object recognition', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'study population', 'visual processing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,510463,0.1413519938354305
"Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing Project Summary The goal of this project is to test a novel theoretical framework for understanding how the ventral pathway subserves object vision. In the standard framework, a series of neural operations on 2D image data through many intermediate cortical stages, including area V4, leads to high-level perceptual representations, including representation of object identity, at the final stages of the ventral pathway. However, our preliminary microelectrode data from a fixating monkey show that many neurons in V4 represent volumetric (volume- enclosing) 3D shape, not 2D image patterns. These neurons respond to many different 2D images that convey the same 3D shape with different shape-in-depth cues, including shading, reflection, and refraction. They even respond preferentially to random dot stereograms that convey 3D volumetric shape with no 2D cues whatsoever. Moreover, our preliminary results with 2-photon functional imaging in anesthetized monkey V4 show that 3D shape signals are grouped by their similarity, and also group with isomorphic (same outline) 2D shape signals (which could contribute evidence to corresponding 3D shape inferences). We propose to capitalize on these preliminary data by demonstrating the prevalence of 3D shape tuning in area V4, analyzing the 3D shape coding strategies used by these neurons, and measuring how 2D and 3D shape signals are arranged at a microscopic level across the surface of V4. We expect these results to provide strong evidence that extraction of 3D shape fragments is a primary goal of V4 processing. This early extraction of 3D shape information, just two synapses beyond primary visual cortex, would suggest a competing framework for understanding the ventral pathway, in which the initial goal is to represent 3D physical structure, independent of the various 2D image cues used to infer it. In this framework, object recognition would be based on preceding information about 3D physical structure, which would explain why human object recognition is so robust to image changes, in a way that the best computational vision systems are not. The scientific impact of this work would be to divert vision experiments toward understanding representation of real world 3D structure (rather than 2D planar stimuli) and to encourage computational vision scientists to incorporate early 3D shape processing into the deep convolutional network models that are the current state of the art. Narrative This study will help explain how the human brain achieves such remarkably robust perception of visual objects. The results will help guide future rehabilitative and prosthetic strategies for patients with visual impairments, by elucidating neural strategies that could be used to bring computer vision prosthetics up to human performance levels, and by discovering specific neural signals for object information that could be replicated by electrode array implants in higher-level visual cortex.",Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing,9579566,R01EY029420,"['Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Microelectrodes', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Ocular Prosthesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'area V4', 'area striata', 'base', 'experimental study', 'individual response', 'network models', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'three dimensional structure', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality', 'visual object processing']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,548567,0.07671382646555973
"Representation of information across the human visual cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human visual system is organized as a parallel, hierarchical network, and successive stages of visual processing appear to represent increasingly complicated aspects of shape-related and semantic information. However, the way that shape-related and semantic information is represented across much of the visual hierarchy is still poorly understood. The primary goal of this proposal is to understand how information about object shape and semantic category is represented explicitly across mid- and high-level visual areas. To address this important issue we propose to undertake a series of human functional MRI (fMRI) studies, using both synthetic and natural movies. Data will be analyzed by means of a powerful voxel-wise modeling (VM) approach that has been developed in my laboratory over the past several years. In Aim 1 we propose to measure human brain activity evoked by synthetic naturalistic movies, and to use VM to evaluate and compare several competing theories of shape representation across the entire visual cortex. In Aim 2 we propose to use VM to evaluate and compare competing theories of semantic representation. In Aim 3 we propose to use machine learning and and VM to discover new aspects of shape and semantic representation. These experiments will provide fundamental new insights about the representation of visual information across visual cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disorders of central vision can severely affect quality of life and the design of treatments and devices for improving visual function will depend critically on understanding the organization of visual cortex. We propose to use functional MRI and sophisticated computational data analysis and modeling procedures to evaluate and compare multiple theories of visual function. The results will reveal how visual information is represented across the several dozen distinct functional areas that constitute human visual cortex.",Representation of information across the human visual cortex,9254553,R01EY019684,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'V2 neuron', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'movie', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'object shape', 'public health relevance', 'receptive field', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'visual processing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,377994,0.1229839036086883
"Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We live in a multisensory world, in which stimuli of various types constantly compete for our attention. Information about objects or events typically appears on more than one sensory channel, so that integrating inputs across sensory systems (e.g. vision and hearing) can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and lead to more efficient perception and action. There is increasing interest in studying how stimulus properties in one sensory modality (e.g. vision) correspond to those in another modality (e.g. hearing). For instance, sounds of high pitch are linked to small-sized visual objects whereas sounds of low pitch are linked with large objects; sounds of high/low pitch are associated with, respectively, visual stimuli of high/low elevation; and even aspects of linguistic stimuli such as vowel quality are associated with visual properties such as object size. Such crossmodal correspondences are important factors in multisensory binding. While information has exploded on the kinds of stimulus features that are reliably associated by human observers across modalities, currently there is little neural evidence to allow a mechanistic account of how crossmodal correspondences arise, or how they relate to synesthesia, a phenomenon in which some individuals experience unusual percepts (e.g. colors) triggered by particular stimuli (e.g. letters. Our goal is to address these important gaps in knowledge, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying crossmodal and synesthetic correspondences and thus to distinguish between alternative explanations that have been offered. A number of possible mechanisms have been entertained for crossmodal correspondences. These include: Hypothesis A - learned associations due to statistical co-occurrences, which would predict that the correspondences are based in multisensory or even classic unisensory regions; Hypothesis B - semantic mediation (e.g. the common word ""high"" may mediate the link between high pitch and high elevation); and Hypothesis C - conceptual linking via a high-level property such as magnitude. In a series of eight experiments that comprise three Specific Aims, we propose to examine these competing accounts, recognizing that some or all of them may be operative, and that the mechanisms may vary between different types of crossmodal correspondences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed systematic study of the brain basis of correspondences between stimulus properties across sensory systems will allow critical insights into the multisensory processing involved in perception and action, illuminate the multisensory basis of language and music, and expand understanding of the phenomenon of synesthesia in relation to normal experience. From a practical standpoint, the proposed work will make significant contributions to the design of sensory substitution approaches for people with visual, auditory and other sensory deficits, and the rehabilitation of individuals with multisensory processing abnormalities, including developmental (autism, dyslexia), neurological (neglect) and psychiatric (schizophrenia) disorders.",Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features,9334867,R01EY025978,"['Activation Analysis', 'Address', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory pitch', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Modality', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'interest', 'multisensory', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory system', 'sound', 'vector', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,620264,0.05787822388558657
"Characterizing and Modeling Infants' Self-Generated Object Views: Implications for Object Recognition and Language Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human visual object recognition is foundational to many achievements—from object name learning to tool use to real world problem solving. Understanding the developmental processes that underlie visual object recognition is of critical importance because the individual differences that characterize early visual object recognition have clinical, educational, and societal implications. For instance, toddlers with poor visual object recognition skills are more likely to have below-average vocabulary sizes. Toddlers with smaller vocabularies have a greater likelihood of developing language impairments and are more likely to lag in pre-literacy and literacy skills. Deficits in visual object recognition and word learning have also been exhibited by individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ADSs). The overarching goal of the proposed project is to better understand the sensory-motor mechanisms that support visual object recognition. Considerable evidence suggests that active object manipulation relates to better visual object recognition, however little is known about the mechanisms through which object manipulation connects to visual object processing during development. The proposed research tests the hypothesis that one major route through which object manipulation matters is that it generates many different views of the same object, and that the variation within multiple visual instances of the same object facilitates visual object recognition by building more generalizable representations for recognizing unseen instances. This hypothesis is tested by (1) characterizing the properties of object information generated by infants during free play and by (2) evaluating the information in those generated visual streams by feeding them to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) – the first computational models of vision capable of human-like visual recognition. Two additional lines of research motivate the approach. First is evidence showing infants learn from statistical regularities in visual inputs presented briefly in a laboratory setting. Second is research using head-mounted cameras suggesting that object views generated by infant manipulation have unique properties, including views dominated by a single object. What we do not yet know are the visual statistics of the views infants generate in everyday toy play or their value for a statistical learner such as CNNs. The proposed research will address these gaps in the literature by characterizing the visual object inputs infants generate and how these inputs may facilitate visual object recognition. The proposed research will also determine how differences in visual inputs may be linked with individual differences in infant object name learning. This research will lead to a deeper understanding of the early development of visual object recognition, and may also provide a crucial missing link in our understanding of the developmental trajectory of other cognitive functions, including object name learning. Moreover, the knowledge to be gained from the proposed research has the potential to inform (1) individual differences in learning, (2) strategies for identifying learning delays, and (3) construction of interventions to remediate learning delays. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to characterize the nature of infants' early visual experiences of objects and their relation to object manipulation, language abilities, and computational models of object recognition. The period of development to be studied – 18 to 24 months – is a period in which delays in visual object recognition and in vocabulary learning have been connected to future development of language impairments and diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). The proposed research is highly relevant to public health as it will elucidate sources of individual differences in early object recognition and word learning, laying the foundation for aiding diagnosis of early language delay and ASDs, as well as the development of future object recognition and vocabulary/language intervention programs.",Characterizing and Modeling Infants' Self-Generated Object Views: Implications for Object Recognition and Language Learning,9395459,F32HD093280,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'feeding', 'intervention program', 'language impairment', 'literacy', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vision development', 'visual object processing', 'word learning']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F32,2017,57066,0.12429894513711437
"Learning and updating internal visual models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In line with the strategic plan of the NEI, this project is focused on filling a profound gap in our understanding of neural mechanisms of visual perception. Specifically, we aim to understand how the adaptation of visual cortical circuits contributes to perception. Adaptation is a ubiquitous process by which neural processing and perception are dramatically influenced by recent visual inputs. However, the functional purpose of adaptation is poorly understood. Based on preliminary data, this project tests the hypothesis that visual adaptation instantiates a form of predictive coding, which is used to make unexpected events salient. We posit that cortical circuits learn the statistical structure of visua input in a manner that extends beyond previous fatigue- based descriptions of adaptation effects. This learning is used to discount expected features and signal novel ones. Our project will test this hypothesis through the collaborative effort of three investigators with expertise in human EEG, animal neurophysiology, and computational modeling. Aim 1 will assess the ability of cortical circuits to adapt to temporal sequences of input and to signal deviations from expected sequences. Aim 2 will evaluate the effect of stimulus uncertainty on adaptation and responses to novel events. Aim 3 will determine how adaptation dynamics and responses to novel stimuli are influenced by the temporal constancy of stimulus statistics. Each of these aims involves an experimental manipulation that yields distinct behavior from fatigue- based and predictive coding mechanisms. Thus, together our aims will provide a robust test of our core hypothesis, and provide a much richer understanding of the adaptive properties of cortical circuits. Results from our project will contribute to answering one of the continuing puzzles in visual research, which is to understand the functional purpose of adaptive mechanisms in visual perception. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: . This research is relevant to public health because it aims to uncover the function of visual adaptation, a fundamental aspect of visual perception. This work is thus essential to the mission of NEI because it will provide a more detailed understanding of how visual cortical circuits underlie visual perception, which is necessary for developing treatment strategies for individuals with visual processing deficits and for the development of effective prosthetic devices.",Learning and updating internal visual models,9334881,R01EY024858,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Work', 'area V4', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'discount', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'human subject', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'treatment strategy', 'visual adaptation', 'visual processing']",NEI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2017,447745,0.11983984364861373
"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9238777,R01EY025332,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image Enhancement', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,416574,0.036112587873681275
"Post-natal development of high-level visual representation in primates View-invariant object recognition is a complex cognitive task that is critical to everyday functioning. A key neural correlate of high-level object recognition is inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a brain area present in both humans and non-human primates. Recent advances in visual systems neuroscience have begun to uncover how images are encoded in the adult IT object representation, however the learning rules by which high level visual areas (especially IT) develop remain mysterious, with both the magnitude and qualitative nature of developmental changes remaining almost completely unknown — in part because, over the last thirty years, there have been practically no studies of spiking neural responses in the higher ventral cortical areas of developing primates. There is thus a significant gap in our understanding of how visual development proceeds.  This exploratory proposal aims to characterize how representation in higher primate visual cortex changes during development. We first aim (Aim 1) to implant chronic electrode arrays to record hundreds of IT neuronal sites in response to thousands of image stimuli in awake behaving juvenile macaques. These data will comprise a snapshot of the developing primate visual representation, and will be particularly powerful because we have already extensively measured adult monkey IT using the same stimuli and methods. By comparing juvenile and adult neuronal responses at both single site and population levels, we will obtain a unprecedentedly large-scale and detailed picture of the neural correlates of high-level visual development (Aim 2).  Aims 1 and 2 are exploratory, but potentially transformative – they will result in publicly available neuronal IT development benchmarks against which any proposed model of high level visual development can be rigorously tested, and will spur the development of those models in our lab and others. In that context, we will also seek (Aim 3) to improve known semi- and un-supervised learning rules from the computer vision and computational neuroscience literature, and to compare them to both recent high-performing (but biologically implausible) supervised models as well to the rich developmental measurements obtained in Aims 1 and 2.  Establishing experimental and surgical procedures for juvenile array recordings will create the future opportunity to observe changes in high level neural visual representations while experience is manipulated in early development, and will enable experiments in other sensory, motor, or decision making domains. If successful, the proposed work will yield a deeper understanding of the principles underlying visual cortex development, understanding which will in turn be helpful for treating neurodevelopmental disorders that implicate cortical circuits, including amblyopia and autism. Project narrative  Visual object recognition is fundamental to our everyday functioning. While the brain is remarkably good at accomplishing these challenging tasks, we do not yet know how it learns this ability during development. The goal of these experiments is to develop new experimental and computational tools to discover the neural learning principles that underlie that visual ability.",Post-natal development of high-level visual representation in primates,9316254,R21EY025863,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amblyopia', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Inferior', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'cognitive task', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'improved', 'juvenile animal', 'learning network', 'mature animal', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'network models', 'neural correlate', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'postnatal', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'vision development']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2017,193375,0.1267564597662795
"Cortical computations underlying binocular motion integration PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Neuroscience is highly specialized—even visual submodalities such as motion, depth, form and color processing are often studied in isolation. One disadvantage of this isolation is that results from each subfield are not brought together to constrain common underlying neural circuitry. Yet, to understand the cortical computations that support vision, it is important to unify our fragmentary models that capture isolated insights across visual submodalities so that all relevant experimental and theoretical efforts can benefit from the most powerful and robust models that can be achieved. This proposal aims to take the first concrete step in that direction by unifying models of direction selectivity, binocular disparity selectivity and 3D motion selectivity (also known as motion-in-depth) to reveal circuits and understand computations from V1 to area MT. Motion in 3D inherently bridges visual submodalities, necessitating the integration of motion and binocular processing, and we are motivated by two recent paradigm-breaking physiological studies that have shown that area MT has a robust representation of 3D motion. In Aim 1, we will create the first unified model and understanding of the relationship between pattern and 3D motion in MT. In Aim 2, we will construct the first unified model of motion and disparity processing in MT. In Aim 3, we will develop a large-scale biologically plausible model of these selectivities that represents realistic response distributions across an MT population. Having a population output that is complete enough to represent widely-used visual stimuli will amplify our ability to link to population read-out theories and to link to results from psychophysical studies of visual perception. Key elements of our approach are (1) an iterative loop between modeling and electrophysiological experiments; (2) building a set of shared models, stimuli, data and analysis tools in a cloud-based system that unifies efforts across labs, creating opportunities for deep collaboration between labs that specialize in relevant submodalities, and encouraging all interested scientists to contribute and benefit; (3) using model-driven experiments to answer open, inter-related questions that involve motion and binocular processing, including motion opponency, spatial integration, binocular integration and the timely problem of how 3D motion is represented in area MT; (4) unifying insights from filter-based models and conceptual, i.e., non-image- computable, models to generate the first large-scale spiking hierarchical circuits that predict and explain how correlated signals and noise are transformed across multiple cortical stages to carry out essential visual computations; and (5) carrying out novel simultaneous recordings across visual areas. This research also has potential long-term benefits in medicine and technology. It will build fundamental knowledge about functional cortical circuitry that someday may be useful for interpreting dysfunctions of the cortex or for helping biomedical engineers construct devices to interface to the brain. Insights gained from the visual cortex may also help to advance computer vision technology. NARRATIVE The processing of visual motion and depth information is essential for a wide variety of important human abilities, including navigating through the world, avoiding collisions, catching and grabbing objects and interpreting complex scenes. To understand how neurons in the visual cortex transform and represent the information that underlies these abilities, we aim to initiate the development of a more complete, biologically constrained and openly available computer model of motion and depth processing that will be used to guide, and to interpret and incorporate results from, primate visual neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments. Gaining an understanding of the normal function of cortical neural circuitry is an important step in building the fundamental knowledge that someday may help to improve the ability to assess dysfunctions of the cortex and may help bioengineers create devices that interface to cortical circuitry to treat disorders and overcome disabilities.",Cortical computations underlying binocular motion integration,9380854,R01EY027023,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Production', 'Psychophysics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Motion', 'Visual Perception', 'area MT', 'base', 'cloud based', 'color processing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fitness', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial integration', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual neuroscience', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,403479,0.0815794382837277
"The role of area V4 in the perception and recognition of visual objects ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human visual system parses the information that reaches our eyes into a meaningful arrangement of regions and objects. This process, called image segmentation, is one of the most challenging computations accomplished by the primate brain. To discover its neural basis we will study neuronal processes in two brain areas in the macaque monkey-V4, a fundamental stage of form processing along the occipito-temporal pathway, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), important for executive control. Dysfunctions of both areas impair shape discrimination behavior in displays that require the identification of segmented objects, strongly suggesting that they are important for image segmentation. Our experimental techniques will include single and multielectrode recordings, behavioral manipulations, perturbation methods and computer models. In Aim 1 we will identify the neural signals that reflect segmentation in visual cortex. Using a variety of parametric stimuli with occlusion, clutter and shadows-stimulus features known to challenge segmentation in natural vision-we will evaluate whether segmentation is achieved by grouping regions with similar surface properties, such as surface color, texture and depth, or by grouping contour segments that are likely to form the boundary of an object or some interplay between these two strategies. We will test the hypothesis that contour grouping mechanisms are most effective under low clutter and close to the fovea. In Aim 2, we will investigate how feedback from PFC modulates shape responses in V4 and facilitates segmentation: we will test the longstanding hypothesis that object recognition in higher cortical stages precedes and facilitates segmentation in the midlevels of visual form processing. We will simultaneously study populations of V4 and PFC neurons while animals engage in shape discrimination behavior. We will use single-trial decoding methods and correlation analyses to relate the content and timing of neuronal responses in the two areas. To causally test the role of feedback from PFC, we will reversibly inactivate PFC by cooling and study V4 neurons. Our results will provide the first detailed, analytical models of V4 neuronal response dynamics in the presence of occlusion and clutter and advance our understanding of how complex visual scenes are processed in area V4. They will also reveal how V4 and PFC together mediate performance on a complex shape discrimination task, how executive function and midlevel vision may be coordinated during behavior and how feedback is used in cortical computation. Object recognition is impaired in visual agnosia, a dysfunction of the occipito-temporal pathway, and in dysfunctions of the PFC (e.g. schizophrenia). Results from these experiments will constitute a major advance in our understanding of the brain computations that underlie segmentation and object recognition and will bring us closer to devising strategies to alleviate and treat brain disorders in which these capacities are impaired. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A fundamental capacity of the primate visual system is its ability to segment visual scenes into component objects and then recognize those objects regardless of partial occlusions and clutter. Using a combination of primate neurophysiology experiments, computational modeling, animal behavior and reversible inactivation methods, we hope to achieve a new level of understanding about visual processing in the context of object recognition; these findings will ultimately bring us closer to devising strategies to alleviate and treat brain disorders of impaired object recognition resulting from dysfunctions in the occipito-temporal pathway (e.g. agnosia) and the prefrontal cortex (e.g. schizophrenia).",The role of area V4 in the perception and recognition of visual objects,9248377,R01EY018839,"['Agnosia', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Discrimination', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Lesion', 'Macaca', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Agnosias', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'area V4', 'awake', 'base', 'design', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'fovea centralis', 'imaging Segmentation', 'impaired capacity', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'object recognition', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'study population', 'visual processing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,479409,0.1413519938354305

"Representation of information across the human visual cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human visual system is organized as a parallel, hierarchical network, and successive stages of visual processing appear to represent increasingly complicated aspects of shape-related and semantic information. However, the way that shape-related and semantic information is represented across much of the visual hierarchy is still poorly understood. The primary goal of this proposal is to understand how information about object shape and semantic category is represented explicitly across mid- and high-level visual areas. To address this important issue we propose to undertake a series of human functional MRI (fMRI) studies, using both synthetic and natural movies. Data will be analyzed by means of a powerful voxel-wise modeling (VM) approach that has been developed in my laboratory over the past several years. In Aim 1 we propose to measure human brain activity evoked by synthetic naturalistic movies, and to use VM to evaluate and compare several competing theories of shape representation across the entire visual cortex. In Aim 2 we propose to use VM to evaluate and compare competing theories of semantic representation. In Aim 3 we propose to use machine learning and and VM to discover new aspects of shape and semantic representation. These experiments will provide fundamental new insights about the representation of visual information across visual cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disorders of central vision can severely affect quality of life and the design of treatments and devices for improving visual function will depend critically on understanding the organization of visual cortex. We propose to use functional MRI and sophisticated computational data analysis and modeling procedures to evaluate and compare multiple theories of visual function. The results will reveal how visual information is represented across the several dozen distinct functional areas that constitute human visual cortex.",Representation of information across the human visual cortex,9040948,R01EY019684,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Space Perception', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'V2 neuron', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'movie', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'object shape', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2016,379313,0.1229839036086883
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,9099855,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'support network', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,368557,0.0842539265292285
"Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We live in a multisensory world, in which stimuli of various types constantly compete for our attention. Information about objects or events typically appears on more than one sensory channel, so that integrating inputs across sensory systems (e.g. vision and hearing) can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and lead to more efficient perception and action. There is increasing interest in studying how stimulus properties in one sensory modality (e.g. vision) correspond to those in another modality (e.g. hearing). For instance, sounds of high pitch are linked to small-sized visual objects whereas sounds of low pitch are linked with large objects; sounds of high/low pitch are associated with, respectively, visual stimuli of high/low elevation; and even aspects of linguistic stimuli such as vowel quality are associated with visual properties such as object size. Such crossmodal correspondences are important factors in multisensory binding. While information has exploded on the kinds of stimulus features that are reliably associated by human observers across modalities, currently there is little neural evidence to allow a mechanistic account of how crossmodal correspondences arise, or how they relate to synesthesia, a phenomenon in which some individuals experience unusual percepts (e.g. colors) triggered by particular stimuli (e.g. letters. Our goal is to address these important gaps in knowledge, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying crossmodal and synesthetic correspondences and thus to distinguish between alternative explanations that have been offered. A number of possible mechanisms have been entertained for crossmodal correspondences. These include: Hypothesis A - learned associations due to statistical co-occurrences, which would predict that the correspondences are based in multisensory or even classic unisensory regions; Hypothesis B - semantic mediation (e.g. the common word ""high"" may mediate the link between high pitch and high elevation); and Hypothesis C - conceptual linking via a high-level property such as magnitude. In a series of eight experiments that comprise three Specific Aims, we propose to examine these competing accounts, recognizing that some or all of them may be operative, and that the mechanisms may vary between different types of crossmodal correspondences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed systematic study of the brain basis of correspondences between stimulus properties across sensory systems will allow critical insights into the multisensory processing involved in perception and action, illuminate the multisensory basis of language and music, and expand understanding of the phenomenon of synesthesia in relation to normal experience. From a practical standpoint, the proposed work will make significant contributions to the design of sensory substitution approaches for people with visual, auditory and other sensory deficits, and the rehabilitation of individuals with multisensory processing abnormalities, including developmental (autism, dyslexia), neurological (neglect) and psychiatric (schizophrenia) disorders.",Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features,9137687,R01EY025978,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Association Learning', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory pitch', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Modality', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'multisensory', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sensory system', 'sound', 'vector', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,565302,0.05787822388558657
"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts b describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations. The results of this research may have implications for understanding development in children who may be at risk for developmental disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and autism spectrum disorders, both of which have been characterized as deficits in implicit learning. Such an understanding may lead to assessment tools more closely tailored to early diagnosis and treatment than are presently available.          Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceive the world a predictable and stable.

"Learning and updating internal visual models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In line with the strategic plan of the NEI, this project is focused on filling a profound gap in our understanding of neural mechanisms of visual perception. Specifically, we aim to understand how the adaptation of visual cortical circuits contributes to perception. Adaptation is a ubiquitous process by which neural processing and perception are dramatically influenced by recent visual inputs. However, the functional purpose of adaptation is poorly understood. Based on preliminary data, this project tests the hypothesis that visual adaptation instantiates a form of predictive coding, which is used to make unexpected events salient. We posit that cortical circuits learn the statistical structure of visua input in a manner that extends beyond previous fatigue- based descriptions of adaptation effects. This learning is used to discount expected features and signal novel ones. Our project will test this hypothesis through the collaborative effort of three investigators with expertise in human EEG, animal neurophysiology, and computational modeling. Aim 1 will assess the ability of cortical circuits to adapt to temporal sequences of input and to signal deviations from expected sequences. Aim 2 will evaluate the effect of stimulus uncertainty on adaptation and responses to novel events. Aim 3 will determine how adaptation dynamics and responses to novel stimuli are influenced by the temporal constancy of stimulus statistics. Each of these aims involves an experimental manipulation that yields distinct behavior from fatigue- based and predictive coding mechanisms. Thus, together our aims will provide a robust test of our core hypothesis, and provide a much richer understanding of the adaptive properties of cortical circuits. Results from our project will contribute to answering one of the continuing puzzles in visual research, which is to understand the functional purpose of adaptive mechanisms in visual perception. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: . This research is relevant to public health because it aims to uncover the function of visual adaptation, a fundamental aspect of visual perception.

"Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired Summary CamIO (""Camera Input-Output"") is a novel camera system designed to make physical objects (including documents, maps and 3D objects such as architectural models) fully accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired.  It works by providing real-time audio-haptic feedback in response to the location on an object that the user is pointing to, which is visible to the camera mounted above the workspace.  While exploring the object, the user can move it freely; a gesture such as ""double-tapping"" with a finger signals for the system to provide audio feedback about the location on the object currently pointed to by the finger (or an enhanced image of the selected location for users with low vision).  Compared with other approaches to making objects accessible to people who are blind or visually impaired, CamIO has several advantages:  (a) there is no need to modify or augment existing objects (e.g., with Braille labels or special touch-sensitive buttons), requiring only a low- cost camera and laptop computer; (b) CamIO is accessible even to those who are not fluent in Braille; and (c) it permits natural exploration of the object with all fingers (in contrast with approaches that rely on the use of a special stylus).  Note also that existing approaches to making graphics on touch-sensitive tablets (such as the iPad) accessible can provide only limited haptic feedback - audio and vibration cues - which is severely impoverished compared with the haptic feedback obtained by exploring a physical object with the fingers.  We propose to develop the necessary computer vision algorithms for CamIO to learn and recognize objects, estimate each object's pose to help determine where the fingers are pointing on the object, track the fingers, recognize gestures and perform OCR (optical character recognition) on text printed on the object surface.  The system will be designed with special user interface features that enable blind or visually impaired users to freely explore an object of interest and interact with it naturally to access the information they want, which will be presented in a modality appropriate for their needs (e.g., text-to-speech or enhanced images of text on the laptop screen).  Additional functions will allow sighted assistants (either in person or remote) to contribute object annotation information.  Finally, people who are blind or visually impaired - the target users of the CamIO system - will be involved in all aspects of this proposed research, to maximize the impact of the research effort.  At the conclusion of the grant we plan to release CamIO software as a free and open source (FOSS) project that anyone can download and use, and which can be freely built on or modified for use in 3rd-party software.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is insufficient access to a wide range of everyday objects needed for daily activities that require visual inspection on the part of the user.  Such objects include printed documents, maps, infographics, and 3D models used in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and are abundant in schools, the home and the workplace.  The proposed research would result in an inexpensive camera-based assistive technology system to provide increased access to such objects for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.                ",Enabling Audio-Haptic Interaction with Physical Objects for the Visually Impaired,9030162,R01EY025332,"['3D Print', 'Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Tactile', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'haptics', 'heuristics', 'interest', 'laptop', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical character recognition', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'vibration']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2016,416574,0.036112587873681275
"The role of area V4 in the perception and recognition of visual objects ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human visual system parses the information that reaches our eyes into a meaningful arrangement of regions and objects. This process, called image segmentation, is one of the most challenging computations accomplished by the primate brain. To discover its neural basis we will study neuronal processes in two brain areas in the macaque monkey-V4, a fundamental stage of form processing along the occipito-temporal pathway, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), important for executive control. Dysfunctions of both areas impair shape discrimination behavior in displays that require the identification of segmented objects, strongly suggesting that they are important for image segmentation. Our experimental techniques will include single and multielectrode recordings, behavioral manipulations, perturbation methods and computer models. In Aim 1 we will identify the neural signals that reflect segmentation in visual cortex. Using a variety of parametric stimuli with occlusion, clutter and shadows-stimulus features known to challenge segmentation in natural vision-we will evaluate whether segmentation is achieved by grouping regions with similar surface properties, such as surface color, texture and depth, or by grouping contour segments that are likely to form the boundary of an object or some interplay between these two strategies. We will test the hypothesis that contour grouping mechanisms are most effective under low clutter and close to the fovea. In Aim 2, we will investigate how feedback from PFC modulates shape responses in V4 and facilitates segmentation: we will test the longstanding hypothesis that object recognition in higher cortical stages precedes and facilitates segmentation in the midlevels of visual form processing. We will simultaneously study populations of V4 and PFC neurons while animals engage in shape discrimination behavior. We will use single-trial decoding methods and correlation analyses to relate the content and timing of neuronal responses in the two areas. To causally test the role of feedback from PFC, we will reversibly inactivate PFC by cooling and study V4 neurons. Our results will provide the first detailed, analytical models of V4 neuronal response dynamics in the presence of occlusion and clutter and advance our understanding of how complex visual scenes are processed in area V4. They will also reveal how V4 and PFC together mediate performance on a complex shape discrimination task, how executive function and midlevel vision may be coordinated during behavior and how feedback is used in cortical computation. Object recognition is impaired in visual agnosia, a dysfunction of the occipito-temporal pathway, and in dysfunctions of the PFC (e.g. schizophrenia). Results from these experiments will constitute a major advance in our understanding of the brain computations that underlie segmentation and object recognition and will bring us closer to devising strategies to alleviate and treat brain disorders in which these capacities are impaired. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A fundamental capacity of the primate visual system is its ability to segment visual scenes into component objects and then recognize those objects regardless of partial occlusions and clutter. Using a combination of primate neurophysiology experiments, computational modeling, animal behavior and reversible inactivation methods, we hope to achieve a new level of understanding about visual processing in the context of object recognition; these findings will ultimately bring us closer to devising strategies to alleviate and treat brain disorders of impaired object recognition resulting from dysfunctions in the occipito-temporal pathway (e.g. agnosia) and the prefrontal cortex (e.g. schizophrenia).",The role of area V4 in the perception and recognition of visual objects,9039081,R01EY018839,"['Agnosia', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Macaca', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Agnosias', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'area V4', 'awake', 'base', 'design', 'executive function', 'feeding', 'fovea centralis', 'imaging Segmentation', 'impaired capacity', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'study population', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,498062,0.1413519938354305
"Representation of information across the human visual cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human visual system is organized as a parallel, hierarchical network, and successive stages of visual processing appear to represent increasingly complicated aspects of shape-related and semantic information. However, the way that shape-related and semantic information is represented across much of the visual hierarchy is still poorly understood. The primary goal of this proposal is to understand how information about object shape and semantic category is represented explicitly across mid- and high-level visual areas. To address this important issue we propose to undertake a series of human functional MRI (fMRI) studies, using both synthetic and natural movies. Data will be analyzed by means of a powerful voxel-wise modeling (VM) approach that has been developed in my laboratory over the past several years. In Aim 1 we propose to measure human brain activity evoked by synthetic naturalistic movies, and to use VM to evaluate and compare several competing theories of shape representation across the entire visual cortex. In Aim 2 we propose to use VM to evaluate and compare competing theories of semantic representation. In Aim 3 we propose to use machine learning and and VM to discover new aspects of shape and semantic representation. These experiments will provide fundamental new insights about the representation of visual information across visual cortex.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disorders of central vision can severely affect quality of life and the design of treatments and devices for improving visual function will depend critically on understanding the organization of visual cortex. We propose to use functional MRI and sophisticated computational data analysis and modeling procedures to evaluate and compare multiple theories of visual function. The results will reveal how visual information is represented across the several dozen distinct functional areas that constitute human visual cortex.                ",Representation of information across the human visual cortex,8888120,R01EY019684,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Space Perception', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'V2 neuron', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'movie', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'object shape', 'public health relevance', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2015,368851,0.1229839036086883
"The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception Project Summary  Vision is central to our interactions with the world. Aside from recognizing faces and communicating with people, our daily activities are also organized around two fundamental tasks: recognizing our environment and navigating through it. The research program of Dr. Aude Oliva constitutes a new integration of behavioral, computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene perception. A growing body of evidence from behavioral, imaging and computational investigations has shown that the perception of complex real-world scenes engages distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms from those engaged in object recognition. To date, however, this evidence has not resulted in a comprehensive framework for understanding scene processing.  Here, the PI proposes to test the novel hypothesis that real-world scene analysis is performed in a network of distinctive brain regions, with each region specialized in representing a different level of scene information. Since scenes are inherently three-dimensional spaces, she will show that the brain capitalizes on information uniquely derived from the space encompassed by a scene, rather than an exclusively object-based description. In other words, before knowing the ""gist of a scene,"" we analyze the ""gist of the space.""  Understanding the nature of the brain's representations of visual scenes is an enterprise that will push the development of fast and reliable rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual and spatial impairments, and push forward the development of aid-based systems that rely on an understanding of the visual space. Real-world scene recognition is an unsolved mystery that will have implications for neuroscience, computational vision, artificial intelligence, robotics and psychology.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,8893998,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,318059,0.0842539265292285
"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable.

This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations. The results of this research may have implications for understanding development in children who may be at risk for developmental disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and autism spectrum disorders, both of which have been characterized as deficits in implicit learning.

"Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We live in a multisensory world, in which stimuli of various types constantly compete for our attention. Information about objects or events typically appears on more than one sensory channel, so that integrating inputs across sensory systems (e.g. vision and hearing) can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and lead to more efficient perception and action. There is increasing interest in studying how stimulus properties in one sensory modality (e.g. vision) correspond to those in another modality (e.g. hearing). For instance, sounds of high pitch are linked to small-sized visual objects whereas sounds of low pitch are linked with large objects; sounds of high/low pitch are associated with, respectively, visual stimuli of high/low elevation; and even aspects of linguistic stimuli such as vowel quality are associated with visual properties such as object size. Such crossmodal correspondences are important factors in multisensory binding. While information has exploded on the kinds of stimulus features that are reliably associated by human observers across modalities, currently there is little neural evidence to allow a mechanistic account of how crossmodal correspondences arise, or how they relate to synesthesia, a phenomenon in which some individuals experience unusual percepts (e.g. colors) triggered by particular stimuli (e.g. letters. Our goal is to address these important gaps in knowledge, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying crossmodal and synesthetic correspondences and thus to distinguish between alternative explanations that have been offered. A number of possible mechanisms have been entertained for crossmodal correspondences. These include: Hypothesis A - learned associations due to statistical co-occurrences, which would predict that the correspondences are based in multisensory or even classic unisensory regions; Hypothesis B - semantic mediation (e.g. the common word ""high"" may mediate the link between high pitch and high elevation); and Hypothesis C - conceptual linking via a high-level property such as magnitude. In a series of eight experiments that comprise three Specific Aims, we propose to examine these competing accounts, recognizing that some or all of them may be operative, and that the mechanisms may vary between different types of crossmodal correspondences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed systematic study of the brain basis of correspondences between stimulus properties across sensory systems will allow critical insights into the multisensory processing involved in perception and action, illuminate the multisensory basis of language and music, and expand understanding of the phenomenon of synesthesia in relation to normal experience. From a practical standpoint, the proposed work will make significant contributions to the design of sensory substitution approaches for people with visual, auditory and other sensory deficits, and the rehabilitation of individuals with multisensory processing abnormalities, including developmental (autism, dyslexia), neurological (neglect) and psychiatric (schizophrenia) disorders.                ",Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features,8988153,R01EY025978,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Association Learning', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory pitch', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Modality', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'multisensory', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sensory system', 'sound', 'vector', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,586366,0.05787822388558657
"Learning and updating internal visual models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In line with the strategic plan of the NEI, this project is focused on filling a profound gap in our understanding of neural mechanisms of visual perception. Specifically, we aim to understand how the adaptation of visual cortical circuits contributes to perception. Adaptation is a ubiquitous process by which neural processing and perception are dramatically influenced by recent visual inputs. However, the functional purpose of adaptation is poorly understood. Based on preliminary data, this project tests the hypothesis that visual adaptation instantiates a form of predictive coding, which is used to make unexpected events salient. We posit that cortical circuits learn the statistical structure of visua input in a manner that extends beyond previous fatigue- based descriptions of adaptation effects. This learning is used to discount expected features and signal novel ones. Our project will test this hypothesis through the collaborative effort of three investigators with expertise in human EEG, animal neurophysiology, and computational modeling. Aim 1 will assess the ability of cortical circuits to adapt to temporal sequences of input and to signal deviations from expected sequences. Aim 2 will evaluate the effect of stimulus uncertainty on adaptation and responses to novel events. Aim 3 will determine how adaptation dynamics and responses to novel stimuli are influenced by the temporal constancy of stimulus statistics. Each of these aims involves an experimental manipulation that yields distinct behavior from fatigue- based and predictive coding mechanisms. Thus, together our aims will provide a robust test of our core hypothesis, and provide a much richer understanding of the adaptive properties of cortical circuits. Results from our project will contribute to answering one of the continuing puzzles in visual research, which is to understand the functional purpose of adaptive mechanisms in visual perception.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: . This research is relevant to public health because it aims to uncover the function of visual adaptation, a fundamental aspect of visual perception.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery from visual impairment caused by eye disease, injury, or brain damage. The behavioral tasks that we develop to enhance learning with attention will inform practices for rehabilitating visual function, and the methods that we develop to study neural interactions during tasks will lead to new approaches for diagnosing disorders of visual processing.

"Neural Basis of Shape from Texture DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People often need to judge the shapes and movements of 3-D objects from a distance. Images on the retinae are 2-D, but pattern and motion information contain cues about 3-D shapes. Building on our previous work we expect to make significant progress in understanding 3-D shape perception from these cues, and thus offer a prototype for how the brain extracts information from the world to infer environmental properties. When surfaces have texture patterns, deformations of these patterns in retinal images provide clues for the brain to judge 3-D shape. When signals from the eyes reach the first cortical area V1, they are processed by neurons that are selectively tuned to orientations and spatial frequencies. We parsed texture deformations into orientation flows and spatial frequency gradients, to show that particular orientation flows evoke percepts of specific 3-D shapes, whereas frequency gradients provide cues to relative depth. These results led to models of how later cortical neurons could extract texture patterns and signal 3-D shapes. We now propose to extend our approach beyond static objects. When objects change shape (e.g. by bending, coiling, or contracting) as they move (e.g. walk, tumble, crawl, hop, slide, or swim), changes in the retinal image create patterns of local velocities that provide additional cues to 3-D shape. Since any retinal image can result from projections of many different 3-D objects, the brain relies on prior assumptions to infer the correct shape. Previous studies have only looked at rigid objects and used shape inference models based either on the brain assuming that the object is rigid or that faster points are nearer. We will use novel stimuli that put these prior assumptions in conflict, and thus examine how the brain potentiates a prior. This section will culminate in a model for choosing between conflicting assumptions, something that is often required in perception and cognition. Next, we will use randomly deforming non-rigid 3-D waves to examine how global shape properties, e.g. symmetry, influence perceived object motions by selectively combining disparate outputs of motion sensitive neurons. These results will unveil interactions between the form and motion cortical systems. Finally, we will examine observers' percepts of dynamic shape changes that require more sophisticated analyses of retinal velocity patterns. Neurons in the motion sensitive cortical area MT respond to 1-D motion shear and compression/divergence, so we will extract these qualities and combine them into 2-D velocity patterns of divergence, rotation, and deformation. Neural filters formed by these patterns will be used to explain perceived changes in 3-D shapes. We will base our filters on responses of MT and later cortical neurons to our stimuli, measured in a parallel project. We will thus present the first neural model that can explain observers' percepts of both rigid and non-rigid textured objects. The performance of our model will be compared against the best computer-vision models on motion-capture data from real deforming objects. We expect this project to introduce new ideas, methods and results for understanding visual perception of 3-D shapes and its deficits in neurological patients. Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously. This project will identify how the brain constructs correct and incorrect shape percepts of 3-D objects from texture and motion information. In addition, people with amblyopia, strabismus and convergence-insufficiency often have deficient stereo vision, so they find texture and motion information to be particularly useful in perceiving 3-D shapes, hence our work on separating velocity information into object motion, object shape, and shape deformation may be particularly useful to these people.",Neural Basis of Shape from Texture,8843856,R01EY013312,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amblyopia', 'Attention', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Contracts', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Frequencies', 'Geometry', 'Head Movements', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Rotation', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Space Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Strabismus', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'Swimming', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analog', 'area MT', 'area V1', 'base', 'design', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'novel', 'object motion', 'object shape', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sample fixation']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2015,354693,0.0719527026355066
"A Visual Assessment System for Retinal Function/Drug Discovery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preclinical evaluation of treatment strategies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases is highly dependent on mouse models. Classical methods to assess the visual function of animals, such as electroretinogram (ERG), which measures electrical responses in the retina, do not address connections between the eye and brain or visual perception by the visual system. This often raises concerns regarding the functional relevance of the therapeutic benefit. Difficulty in assessing visual perception and related behavior in mice and rats, largely due to their subtle visual behavior cues and the lack of adequate measuring devices, presents a critical barrier to the application of mouse models for evaluating treatment efficacy of new drugs, and for scaling up for behavior phenotyping to screen genetic vision defects. Pupillary light reflex (PLR) and optokinetic reflex (OKR) tests are useful methods in clinics for assessing human visual responses and perception. However, such tests have been difficult to conduct in rodents because current rodent visual testing methods or devices either do not allow accurate quantitative assessment for PLR or OKR or use subjective measures to score visual responses. To address these challenges, we propose to advance the technology by designing an easy-to-use automated platform that employs an eye/pupil tracking device equipped with a computer vision system (chiefly the interactive tracking system) for unambiguous objective scoring of visual responses. Our proposed new device will allow real-time quantitative and accurate assessment of rodent visual function including light responses, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. The novelty of our system also lies in that it does not require complicated calibration procedures needed in commonly used human eye tracking. Rather than precisely measuring the extent of eye turning (or orientation), we propose to detect the signature eye movement in accordance with the speed and direction of visual stimuli. The system will be validated using normal wildtype mice and mouse models of retinal neurodegeneration known to develop visual behavior changes in the parameters mentioned above. Although rodent eye tracking has been investigated before, this proposed visual assessment system would be the first commercially viable product that uses an eye/pupil tracking device to automatically assess visual perception in rodents. The combined PLR and OKR tests and vastly simplified and automated quantification methods will also provide the first scalable behavior platform for phenotyping and drug discovery in the vision research area. In the future, this technology has the potential of being expanded to measure responses from various visual stimuli. This may translate into broader applications for evaluating brain diseases that afflict the visual pathways. This platform for mouse visual behavior assessment will therefore greatly facilitate drug discovery and development aimed at preventing and slowing vision loss or restoring sight, helping to combat devastating blinding conditions such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the current proposal is to design and develop an automated system for the measure of rodent (mice and rats) light response, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity. The system will apply human eye/pupil tracking techniques for objective and unambiguous evaluation of light response and visual perception. This platform will provide a powerful tool for phenotypic studies as well as for discovery of new drugs that can prevent or restore sight caused by blinding conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma.                ",A Visual Assessment System for Retinal Function/Drug Discovery,8980787,R41EY025913,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Coma', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electroretinography', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eye diseases', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Screening', 'Glaucoma', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Procedures', 'Pupil', 'Pupil light reflex', 'Rattus', 'Reflex action', 'Research Institute', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rodent', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual system structure', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'computer generated', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'genetic approach', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid crystal', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'performance tests', 'photoreceptor degeneration', 'preclinical evaluation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'scale up', 'success', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'treatment strategy', 'visual performance', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,"AFASCI, INC.",R41,2015,233235,0.04485802448087545
"The role of area V4 in the perception and recognition of visual objects ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human visual system parses the information that reaches our eyes into a meaningful arrangement of regions and objects. This process, called image segmentation, is one of the most challenging computations accomplished by the primate brain. To discover its neural basis we will study neuronal processes in two brain areas in the macaque monkey-V4, a fundamental stage of form processing along the occipito-temporal pathway, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), important for executive control. Dysfunctions of both areas impair shape discrimination behavior in displays that require the identification of segmented objects, strongly suggesting that they are important for image segmentation. Our experimental techniques will include single and multielectrode recordings, behavioral manipulations, perturbation methods and computer models. In Aim 1 we will identify the neural signals that reflect segmentation in visual cortex. Using a variety of parametric stimuli with occlusion, clutter and shadows-stimulus features known to challenge segmentation in natural vision-we will evaluate whether segmentation is achieved by grouping regions with similar surface properties, such as surface color, texture and depth, or by grouping contour segments that are likely to form the boundary of an object or some interplay between these two strategies. We will test the hypothesis that contour grouping mechanisms are most effective under low clutter and close to the fovea. In Aim 2, we will investigate how feedback from PFC modulates shape responses in V4 and facilitates segmentation: we will test the longstanding hypothesis that object recognition in higher cortical stages precedes and facilitates segmentation in the midlevels of visual form processing. We will simultaneously study populations of V4 and PFC neurons while animals engage in shape discrimination behavior. We will use single-trial decoding methods and correlation analyses to relate the content and timing of neuronal responses in the two areas. To causally test the role of feedback from PFC, we will reversibly inactivate PFC by cooling and study V4 neurons. Our results will provide the first detailed, analytical models of V4 neuronal response dynamics in the presence of occlusion and clutter and advance our understanding of how complex visual scenes are processed in area V4. They will also reveal how V4 and PFC together mediate performance on a complex shape discrimination task, how executive function and midlevel vision may be coordinated during behavior and how feedback is used in cortical computation. Object recognition is impaired in visual agnosia, a dysfunction of the occipito-temporal pathway, and in dysfunctions of the PFC (e.g. schizophrenia). Results from these experiments will constitute a major advance in our understanding of the brain computations that underlie segmentation and object recognition and will bring us closer to devising strategies to alleviate and treat brain disorders in which these capacities are impaired.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A fundamental capacity of the primate visual system is its ability to segment visual scenes into component objects and then recognize those objects regardless of partial occlusions and clutter. Using a combination of primate neurophysiology experiments, computational modeling, animal behavior and reversible inactivation methods, we hope to achieve a new level of understanding about visual processing in the context of object recognition; these findings will ultimately bring us closer to devising strategies to alleviate and treat brain disorders of impaired object recognition resulting from dysfunctions in the occipito-temporal pathway (e.g. agnosia) and the prefrontal cortex (e.g. schizophrenia).                ",The role of area V4 in the perception and recognition of visual objects,8893671,R01EY018839,"['Agnosia', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Macaca', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Relative (related person)', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Agnosias', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'area V4', 'awake', 'base', 'design', 'executive function', 'feeding', 'fovea centralis', 'imaging Segmentation', 'impaired capacity', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'object recognition', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,479568,0.1413519938354305
"CRCNS: Neural Reprensentation of Hierarchical Visual Concepts in Natural Scenes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of natural images is potentially enormous: the number of possible images that can be described by a smallish (100 by 100 pixels) picture is practically infinite (10000256), more than all the images the human race has ever witnessed during its entire existence. How can any system process input data of this magnitude of dimensions and interpret/understand it in terms of the estimated 200,000 objects in the world, their spatial layouts, and scene structures? Yet, this is a task that human visual systems routinely perform in a fraction of a second. The secret must lie in the fact that natural images are highly redundant, living in a restricted space inside this universe of almost infinite possibilities, and that mammalian visual systems have discovered and exploited this fact. In particular, we conjecture that neurons and populations are tuned to the statistical structure of natural images, building on previous work showing, for example, that sparse coding ideas can help predict receptive field properties of 'simple cells' in the visual cortex. This proposal has three stages. Firstly, we will perform a statistical analysis of natural images to classify and model the types of visual patches that appear. This will result in a stimulus dictionary, which will be used as stimuli to investigate the tuning properties of neurons and neuronal populations, and a visual concept dictionary which will be used to make predictions for the tuning properties. Secondly, we will perform multielectrode neurophysiological investigation of the tuning properties of neurons, and neuron populations, at different levels of the visual cortex in response to the stimulus dictionary. Thirdly, we will perform data analysis to model the tuning properties of neurons and populations using a combination of model-driven, which assumes that neurons are tuned to statistical properties of images, and data-driven approaches which can be thought of as learning 'neural visual concepts' directly from the neuron's response to the stimuli. Our theoretical approach - for learning the stimuli dictionary, the visual concepts, and performing data analysis - is based on statistical and machine learning techniques. These assume a hierarchical compositional structure for the data which offers the possibility of taming the complexity of natural images and is also consistent with the known hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. Intellectual merit: This research will help understand the structure of natural images, determine models for the tuning properties of neurons in the visual cortex, and develop novel data analysis techniques. It has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the statistical structures of natural images and the neural encoding of these structures, including the population level. This will lead to greater understanding of the visual cortex and also help the development of computer vision systems. Broader impacts: This project is interdisciplinary in nature and should have broad impact in multiple disciplines: neuroscience and biological vision, statistical neural data analysis, computer vision, and machine learning. Understanding neuronal properties in the visual cortex is a pre-requisite to the clinical enterprise of developing therapeutic methods and prosthetic devices for the visually impaired. The proposed research program will help facilitate a new graduate program in Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience at UCLA, an inter-college undergraduate minor in Neural Computation at CMU that the investigators are developing at their respective universities. The investigators also plan to organize workshops in NIPS, COSYNE, as well as to integrate their research into both undergraduate and graduate curriculum in their respective universities. This work will also affect undergraduate students at other colleges, by a summer undergraduate training program in Pittsburgh, another at CMU's Qatar campus. In addition, we will propose a workshop and summer school at IPAM (UCLA). We anticipate that this research will lead to invited lectures, peer reviewed publications and, if successful, will have national and international impact. The PIs have good track record in involving undergraduates, including women and minorities, in their NSF-sponsored research, and will continue to endeavor in the training of the next generation of computational neuroscientists. This project will lead to greater understanding of neural mechanisms and coding strategies in the primate  visual cortex.

"The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception  Project Summary  Vision is central to our interactions with the world. Aside from recognizing faces and communicating with people, our daily activities are also organized around two fundamental tasks: recognizing our environment and navigating through it. The research program of Dr. Aude Oliva constitutes a new integration of behavioral, computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene perception. A growing body of evidence from behavioral, imaging and computational investigations has shown that the perception of complex real-world scenes engages distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms from those engaged in object recognition. To date, however, this evidence has not resulted in a comprehensive framework for understanding scene processing.  Here, the PI proposes to test the novel hypothesis that real-world scene analysis is performed in a network of distinctive brain regions, with each region specialized in representing a different level of scene information. Since scenes are inherently three-dimensional spaces, she will show that the brain capitalizes on information uniquely derived from the space encompassed by a scene, rather than an exclusively object-based description. In other words, before knowing the ""gist of a scene,"" we analyze the ""gist of the space.""  Understanding the nature of the brain's representations of visual scenes is an enterprise that will push the development of fast and reliable rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual and spatial impairments, and push forward the development of aid-based systems that rely on an understanding of the visual space. Real-world scene recognition is an unsolved mystery that will have implications for neuroscience, computational vision, artificial intelligence, robotics and psychology.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts b describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations. The results of this research may have implications for understanding development in children who may be at risk for developmental disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and autism spectrum disorders, both of which have been characterized as deficits in implicit learning.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery from visual impairment caused by eye disease, injury, or brain damage. The behavioral tasks that we develop to enhance learning with attention will inform practices for rehabilitating visual function, and the methods that we develop to study neural interactions during tasks will lead to new approaches for diagnosing disorders of visual processing.

"Visual Summary-Statistic Processing in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Part of the NICHD's mission is to support basic research in human development. The Developmental Cognitive Psychology, Behavioral Neuroscience, and Psychobiology program supports research to identify links between the developing brain and the environment. The proposed research has been designed to help us understand how the visual environment shapes infants' use of summary statistics to describe the things they see. A growing body of research suggests that adults summarize a great deal of visual information by describing the world with texture-like measurements - instead of measuring exactly what we saw and where we saw it, we often pool information together over large areas by measuring how simple features co-occur and forgetting about exactly where they came from. For some tasks, these kinds of descriptions are useful. In other cases, like recognizing a single object in clutter, they don't work well at all. Understanding the limits of these summary statistic descriptions of our visual world has given us insights into why adults sometimes find visual search difficult (Rosenholtz et al., 2012), why it's hard to recognize single objects in clutter (Balas et al., 2009), and may help us understand conditions like amblyopia or macular degeneration, where we think these kinds of summaries may be nearly all the visual system has to work with. In these studies, we will work with infants and adults to understand how summary-statistic descriptions are shaped by the visual environment. We will use computer graphics techniques to create artificial textures that are matched to natural textures using a model of the early visual system. Our goal is to determine how different artificial textures need to be from natural textures for infants to tell them apart. By using a computer graphics model, we can carefully control what information is available to tell the images apart, which will help us understand what measurements contribute to infants' summary-statistic descriptions as they get older. Further, we plan to measure how well infants can tell real textures apart from artificial ones by measuring how their brain responds to those images. We will use EEG to measure how the brain responds to different kinds of natural and artificial textures. Different neural response reflect different kinds of processing in the brain, and we plan to use the location and the timing of the differences we see in infants' brains to help us understand how summary statistics are applied. These studies support the NICHD's mission and will help us understand the perceptual difficulties that some children and adults have due to visual impairments that force summary statistics to be used all the time.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The human visual system summarizes a great deal of what we see by measuring what we saw, but forgetting exactly where we saw it. This strategy is good for recognizing textures like wood or stone, but makes it difficult to recognize individual objects that have lots of clutter around them. We plan to study how infants recognize textures so we can understand how their visual system learns to summarize information this way, which will help us, understand some visual impairment that result from the visual system being forced to use summaries like this all the time.            ",Visual Summary-Statistic Processing in Infancy,8687212,R15EY024375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amblyopia', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calculi', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complement', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Paired Comparison', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Race', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Psychophysics', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Vocabulary', 'Wood material', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'deviant', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'infancy', 'insight', 'preference', 'programs', 'psychobiology', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'shape analysis', 'spatial integration', 'statistics', 'vision development', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual search']",NEI,NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2014,408066,0.08987651962062398
"Neural Basis of Shape from Texture     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People often need to judge the shapes and movements of 3-D objects from a distance. Images on the retinae are 2-D, but pattern and motion information contain cues about 3-D shapes. Building on our previous work we expect to make significant progress in understanding 3-D shape perception from these cues, and thus offer a prototype for how the brain extracts information from the world to infer environmental properties. When surfaces have texture patterns, deformations of these patterns in retinal images provide clues for the brain to judge 3-D shape. When signals from the eyes reach the first cortical area V1, they are processed by neurons that are selectively tuned to orientations and spatial frequencies. We parsed texture deformations into orientation flows and spatial frequency gradients, to show that particular orientation flows evoke percepts of specific 3-D shapes, whereas frequency gradients provide cues to relative depth. These results led to models of how later cortical neurons could extract texture patterns and signal 3-D shapes. We now propose to extend our approach beyond static objects. When objects change shape (e.g. by bending, coiling, or contracting) as they move (e.g. walk, tumble, crawl, hop, slide, or swim), changes in the retinal image create patterns of local velocities that provide additional cues to 3-D shape. Since any retinal image can result from projections of many different 3-D objects, the brain relies on prior assumptions to infer the correct shape. Previous studies have only looked at rigid objects and used shape inference models based either on the brain assuming that the object is rigid or that faster points are nearer. We will use novel stimuli that put these prior assumptions in conflict, and thus examine how the brain potentiates a prior. This section will culminate in a model for choosing between conflicting assumptions, something that is often required in perception and cognition. Next, we will use randomly deforming non-rigid 3-D waves to examine how global shape properties, e.g. symmetry, influence perceived object motions by selectively combining disparate outputs of motion sensitive neurons. These results will unveil interactions between the form and motion cortical systems. Finally, we will examine observers' percepts of dynamic shape changes that require more sophisticated analyses of retinal velocity patterns. Neurons in the motion sensitive cortical area MT respond to 1-D motion shear and compression/divergence, so we will extract these qualities and combine them into 2-D velocity patterns of divergence, rotation, and deformation. Neural filters formed by these patterns will be used to explain perceived changes in 3-D shapes. We will base our filters on responses of MT and later cortical neurons to our stimuli, measured in a parallel project. We will thus present the first neural model that can explain observers' percepts of both rigid and non-rigid textured objects. The performance of our model will be compared against the best computer-vision models on motion-capture data from real deforming objects. We expect this project to introduce new ideas, methods and results for understanding visual perception of 3-D shapes and its deficits in neurological patients.          Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously. This project will identify how the brain constructs correct and incorrect shape percepts of 3-D objects from texture and motion information. In addition, people with amblyopia, strabismus and convergence-insufficiency often have deficient stereo vision, so they find texture and motion information to be particularly useful in perceiving 3-D shapes, hence our work on separating velocity information into object motion, object shape, and shape deformation may be particularly useful to these people.

"CRCNS: Neural Reprensentation of Hierarchical Visual Concepts in Natural Scenes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of natural images is potentially enormous: the number of possible images that can be described by a smallish (100 by 100 pixels) picture is practically infinite (10000256), more than all the images the human race has ever witnessed during its entire existence. How can any system process input data of this magnitude of dimensions and interpret/understand it in terms of the estimated 200,000 objects in the world, their spatial layouts, and scene structures? Yet, this is a task that human visual systems routinely perform in a fraction of a second. The secret must lie in the fact that natural images are highly redundant, living in a restricted space inside this universe of almost infinite possibilities, and that mammalian visual systems have discovered and exploited this fact. In particular, we conjecture that neurons and populations are tuned to the statistical structure of natural images, building on previous work showing, for example, that sparse coding ideas can help predict receptive field properties of 'simple cells' in the visual cortex. This proposal has three stages. Firstly, we will perform a statistical analysis of natural images to classify and model the types of visual patches that appear. This will result in a stimulus dictionary, which will be used as stimuli to investigate the tuning properties of neurons and neuronal populations, and a visual concept dictionary which will be used to make predictions for the tuning properties. Secondly, we will perform multielectrode neurophysiological investigation of the tuning properties of neurons, and neuron populations, at different levels of the visual cortex in response to the stimulus dictionary. Thirdly, we will perform data analysis to model the tuning properties of neurons and populations using a combination of model-driven, which assumes that neurons are tuned to statistical properties of images, and data-driven approaches which can be thought of as learning 'neural visual concepts' directly from the neuron's response to the stimuli. Our theoretical approach - for learning the stimuli dictionary, the visual concepts, and performing data analysis - is based on statistical and machine learning techniques. These assume a hierarchical compositional structure for the data which offers the possibility of taming the complexity of natural images and is also consistent with the known hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. Intellectual merit: This research will help understand the structure of natural images, determine models for the tuning properties of neurons in the visual cortex, and develop novel data analysis techniques. It has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the statistical structures of natural images and the neural encoding of these structures, including the population level. This will lead to greater understanding of the visual cortex and also help the development of computer vision systems. Broader impacts: This project is interdisciplinary in nature and should have broad impact in multiple disciplines: neuroscience and biological vision, statistical neural data analysis, computer vision, and machine learning. Understanding neuronal properties in the visual cortex is a pre-requisite to the clinical enterprise of developing therapeutic methods and prosthetic devices for the visually impaired. The proposed research program will help facilitate a new graduate program in Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience at UCLA, an inter-college undergraduate minor in Neural Computation at CMU that the investigators are developing at their respective universities. The investigators also plan to organize workshops in NIPS, COSYNE, as well as to integrate their research into both undergraduate and graduate curriculum in their respective universities. This work will also affect undergraduate students at other colleges, by a summer undergraduate training program in Pittsburgh, another at CMU's Qatar campus. In addition, we will propose a workshop and summer school at IPAM (UCLA). We anticipate that this research will lead to invited lectures, peer reviewed publications and, if successful, will have national and international impact. The PIs have good track record in involving undergraduates, including women and minorities, in their NSF-sponsored research, and will continue to endeavor in the training of the next generation of computational neuroscientists. This project will lead to greater understanding of neural mechanisms and coding strategies in the primate  visual cortex.

"The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception  Project Summary  Vision is central to our interactions with the world. Aside from recognizing faces and communicating with people, our daily activities are also organized around two fundamental tasks: recognizing our environment and navigating through it. The research program of Dr. Aude Oliva constitutes a new integration of behavioral, computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene perception. A growing body of evidence from behavioral, imaging and computational investigations has shown that the perception of complex real-world scenes engages distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms from those engaged in object recognition. To date, however, this evidence has not resulted in a comprehensive framework for understanding scene processing.  Here, the PI proposes to test the novel hypothesis that real-world scene analysis is performed in a network of distinctive brain regions, with each region specialized in representing a different level of scene information. Since scenes are inherently three-dimensional spaces, she will show that the brain capitalizes on information uniquely derived from the space encompassed by a scene, rather than an exclusively object-based description. In other words, before knowing the ""gist of a scene,"" we analyze the ""gist of the space.""  Understanding the nature of the brain's representations of visual scenes is an enterprise that will push the development of fast and reliable rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual and spatial impairments, and push forward the development of aid-based systems that rely on an understanding of the visual space. Real-world scene recognition is an unsolved mystery that will have implications for neuroscience, computational vision, artificial intelligence, robotics and psychology.

In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts b describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations. The results of this research may have implications for understanding development in children who may be at risk for developmental disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and autism spectrum disorders, both of which have been characterized as deficits in implicit learning. Such an understanding may lead to assessment tools more closely tailored to early diagnosis and treatment than are presently available.          Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceive the world a predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination o infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts by describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This research will bring nw findings and new theoretical perspectives to longstanding debates about the origins of knowledge, ad may shed light on possible ways of examining atypical development, as when implicit learning is disrupted in infants at risk for autism or iron-deficiency anemia.

"Perception of Tactile Graphics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad objective of the proposed research is to answer the following question: why are tactile graphics difficult to understand? People with normal vision can easily recognize line drawings of objects. However, both blind and sighted people find it very difficult to recognize the same drawings when they are presented as tactile images. For blind people, tactile graphics are the only solution for accessing information in visual diagrams and illustrations found in textbooks. Consequently, the results of the proposed research will be used to improve the production of tactile graphics so that they are better understood by blind people. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) explore how the complexity of tactile images affects perception, 2) determine the effects of spatial and temporal integration on perception of tactile images, and 3) investigate how well people can recognize tactile images of objects embedded in backgrounds. The general methodology of the proposed experiments is to present participants with tactile images and to have them draw what they perceive the images to be. Blind individuals will draw tactile images using special paper and a stylus. The experimenters will evaluate the drawings by using a quantitative measure that computes a distance score reflecting the discrepancy between the original image and the participant's drawing. In the first study, participants will feel tactile stimuli of varying complexity, from simple lines in different orientations to complex depictions of objects. The second study will determine the limitations of tactile perceptual integration by limiting either the spatial or temporal window over which participants feel the image. Participants will either view or feel images through apertures of various sizes (spatial window) or they will have a limited amount of time to view or feel the images (temporal window). In the third study, participants will feel tactile images of objects embedded in simple backgrounds. This research will impact several areas of study, including computer vision, human object and scene recognition, and low vision rehabilitation.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance The proposed research seeks to improve the translation of visual graphics into tactile graphics for use by visually-impaired individuals. By making the information in visual graphics more accessible, this research will improve educational services for people with low vision. This work will also facilitate the development of better visual-to-tactile substitution technologies.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery from visual impairment caused by eye disease, injury, or brain damage. The behavioral tasks that we develop to enhance learning with attention will inform practices for rehabilitating visual function, and the methods that we develop to study neural interactions during tasks will lead to new approaches for diagnosing disorders of visual processing.

"Neural Basis of Shape from Texture     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People often need to judge the shapes and movements of 3-D objects from a distance. Images on the retinae are 2-D, but pattern and motion information contain cues about 3-D shapes. Building on our previous work we expect to make significant progress in understanding 3-D shape perception from these cues, and thus offer a prototype for how the brain extracts information from the world to infer environmental properties. When surfaces have texture patterns, deformations of these patterns in retinal images provide clues for the brain to judge 3-D shape. When signals from the eyes reach the first cortical area V1, they are processed by neurons that are selectively tuned to orientations and spatial frequencies. We parsed texture deformations into orientation flows and spatial frequency gradients, to show that particular orientation flows evoke percepts of specific 3-D shapes, whereas frequency gradients provide cues to relative depth. These results led to models of how later cortical neurons could extract texture patterns and signal 3-D shapes. We now propose to extend our approach beyond static objects. When objects change shape (e.g. by bending, coiling, or contracting) as they move (e.g. walk, tumble, crawl, hop, slide, or swim), changes in the retinal image create patterns of local velocities that provide additional cues to 3-D shape. Since any retinal image can result from projections of many different 3-D objects, the brain relies on prior assumptions to infer the correct shape. Previous studies have only looked at rigid objects and used shape inference models based either on the brain assuming that the object is rigid or that faster points are nearer. We will use novel stimuli that put these prior assumptions in conflict, and thus examine how the brain potentiates a prior. This section will culminate in a model for choosing between conflicting assumptions, something that is often required in perception and cognition. Next, we will use randomly deforming non-rigid 3-D waves to examine how global shape properties, e.g. symmetry, influence perceived object motions by selectively combining disparate outputs of motion sensitive neurons. These results will unveil interactions between the form and motion cortical systems. Finally, we will examine observers' percepts of dynamic shape changes that require more sophisticated analyses of retinal velocity patterns. Neurons in the motion sensitive cortical area MT respond to 1-D motion shear and compression/divergence, so we will extract these qualities and combine them into 2-D velocity patterns of divergence, rotation, and deformation. Neural filters formed by these patterns will be used to explain perceived changes in 3-D shapes. We will base our filters on responses of MT and later cortical neurons to our stimuli, measured in a parallel project. We will thus present the first neural model that can explain observers' percepts of both rigid and non-rigid textured objects. The performance of our model will be compared against the best computer-vision models on motion-capture data from real deforming objects. We expect this project to introduce new ideas, methods and results for understanding visual perception of 3-D shapes and its deficits in neurological patients.          Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously. This project will identify how the brain constructs correct and incorrect shape percepts of 3-D objects from texture and motion information. In addition, people with amblyopia, strabismus and convergence-insufficiency often have deficient stereo vision, so they find texture and motion information to be particularly useful in perceiving 3-D shapes, hence our work on separating velocity information into object motion, object shape, and shape deformation may be particularly useful to these people.

"Object Concepts  Project Summary What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.  Narrative Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world. Concepts organize our experiences, and they alter perception, memory, language, and action. The goal of this project is to understand the way in which conceptual knowledge is organized and the manner in which it is implemented in the brain. We will apply innovative neuroscientific methods to discover how we learn about the objects around us and how we access that information when remembering those objects.",Object Concepts,8537463,R01EY021717,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Solutions', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'austin', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mental representation', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,374225,0.06003844167040062
"CRCNS: Neural Reprensentation of Hierarchical Visual Concepts in Natural Scenes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of natural images is potentially enormous: the number of possible images that can be described by a smallish (100 by 100 pixels) picture is practically infinite (10000256), more than all the images the human race has ever witnessed during its entire existence. How can any system process input data of this magnitude of dimensions and interpret/understand it in terms of the estimated 200,000 objects in the world, their spatial layouts, and scene structures? Yet, this is a task that human visual systems routinely perform in a fraction of a second. The secret must lie in the fact that natural images are highly redundant, living in a restricted space inside this universe of almost infinite possibilities, and that mammalian visual systems have discovered and exploited this fact. In particular, we conjecture that neurons and populations are tuned to the statistical structure of natural images, building on previous work showing, for example, that sparse coding ideas can help predict receptive field properties of 'simple cells' in the visual cortex. This proposal has three stages. Firstly, we will perform a statistical analysis of natural images to classify and model the types of visual patches that appear. This will result in a stimulus dictionary, which will be used as stimuli to investigate the tuning properties of neurons and neuronal populations, and a visual concept dictionary which will be used to make predictions for the tuning properties. Secondly, we will perform multielectrode neurophysiological investigation of the tuning properties of neurons, and neuron populations, at different levels of the visual cortex in response to the stimulus dictionary. Thirdly, we will perform data analysis to model the tuning properties of neurons and populations using a combination of model-driven, which assumes that neurons are tuned to statistical properties of images, and data-driven approaches which can be thought of as learning 'neural visual concepts' directly from the neuron's response to the stimuli. Our theoretical approach - for learning the stimuli dictionary, the visual concepts, and performing data analysis - is based on statistical and machine learning techniques. These assume a hierarchical compositional structure for the data which offers the possibility of taming the complexity of natural images and is also consistent with the known hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. Intellectual merit: This research will help understand the structure of natural images, determine models for the tuning properties of neurons in the visual cortex, and develop novel data analysis techniques. It has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the statistical structures of natural images and the neural encoding of these structures, including the population level. This will lead to greater understanding of the visual cortex and also help the development of computer vision systems. Broader impacts: This project is interdisciplinary in nature and should have broad impact in multiple disciplines: neuroscience and biological vision, statistical neural data analysis, computer vision, and machine learning. Understanding neuronal properties in the visual cortex is a pre-requisite to the clinical enterprise of developing therapeutic methods and prosthetic devices for the visually impaired. The proposed research program will help facilitate a new graduate program in Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience at UCLA, an inter-college undergraduate minor in Neural Computation at CMU that the investigators are developing at their respective universities.

"The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception  Project Summary  Vision is central to our interactions with the world. Aside from recognizing faces and communicating with people, our daily activities are also organized around two fundamental tasks: recognizing our environment and navigating through it. The research program of Dr. Aude Oliva constitutes a new integration of behavioral, computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene perception. A growing body of evidence from behavioral, imaging and computational investigations has shown that the perception of complex real-world scenes engages distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms from those engaged in object recognition. To date, however, this evidence has not resulted in a comprehensive framework for understanding scene processing.  Here, the PI proposes to test the novel hypothesis that real-world scene analysis is performed in a network of distinctive brain regions, with each region specialized in representing a different level of scene information. Since scenes are inherently three-dimensional spaces, she will show that the brain capitalizes on information uniquely derived from the space encompassed by a scene, rather than an exclusively object-based description. In other words, before knowing the ""gist of a scene,"" we analyze the ""gist of the space.""  Understanding the nature of the brain's representations of visual scenes is an enterprise that will push the development of fast and reliable rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual and spatial impairments, and push forward the development of aid-based systems that rely on an understanding of the visual space. Real-world scene recognition is an unsolved mystery that will have implications for neuroscience, computational vision, artificial intelligence, robotics and psychology.  Narrative The research program constitutes a new integration of computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene and space perception, with the aim of unraveling how the understanding of visual environments (where we are, where to navigate) arises in the human brain.",The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception,8206519,R01EY020484,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Space Perception', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'programs', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2012,409600,0.09252738854088315
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia.

"Perception of Tactile Graphics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad objective of the proposed research is to answer the following question: why are tactile graphics difficult to understand? People with normal vision can easily recognize line drawings of objects. However, both blind and sighted people find it very difficult to recognize the same drawings when they are presented as tactile images. For blind people, tactile graphics are the only solution for accessing information in visual diagrams and illustrations found in textbooks. Consequently, the results of the proposed research will be used to improve the production of tactile graphics so that they are better understood by blind people. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) explore how the complexity of tactile images affects perception, 2) determine the effects of spatial and temporal integration on perception of tactile images, and 3) investigate how well people can recognize tactile images of objects embedded in backgrounds. The general methodology of the proposed experiments is to present participants with tactile images and to have them draw what they perceive the images to be. Blind individuals will draw tactile images using special paper and a stylus. The experimenters will evaluate the drawings by using a quantitative measure that computes a distance score reflecting the discrepancy between the original image and the participant's drawing. In the first study, participants will feel tactile stimuli of varying complexity, from simple lines in different orientations to complex depictions of objects. The second study will determine the limitations of tactile perceptual integration by limiting either the spatial or temporal window over which participants feel the image. Participants will either view or feel images through apertures of various sizes (spatial window) or they will have a limited amount of time to view or feel the images (temporal window). In the third study, participants will feel tactile images of objects embedded in simple backgrounds. This research will impact several areas of study, including computer vision, human object and scene recognition, and low vision rehabilitation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance The proposed research seeks to improve the translation of visual graphics into tactile graphics for use by visually-impaired individuals.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery from visual impairment caused by eye disease, injury, or brain damage. The behavioral tasks that we develop to enhance learning with attention will inform practices for rehabilitating visual function, and the methods that we develop to study neural interactions during tasks will lead to new approaches for diagnosing disorders of visual processing.

"Neural Basis of Shape from Texture     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People often need to judge the shapes and movements of 3-D objects from a distance. Images on the retinae are 2-D, but pattern and motion information contain cues about 3-D shapes. Building on our previous work we expect to make significant progress in understanding 3-D shape perception from these cues, and thus offer a prototype for how the brain extracts information from the world to infer environmental properties. When surfaces have texture patterns, deformations of these patterns in retinal images provide clues for the brain to judge 3-D shape. When signals from the eyes reach the first cortical area V1, they are processed by neurons that are selectively tuned to orientations and spatial frequencies. We parsed texture deformations into orientation flows and spatial frequency gradients, to show that particular orientation flows evoke percepts of specific 3-D shapes, whereas frequency gradients provide cues to relative depth. These results led to models of how later cortical neurons could extract texture patterns and signal 3-D shapes. We now propose to extend our approach beyond static objects. When objects change shape (e.g. by bending, coiling, or contracting) as they move (e.g. walk, tumble, crawl, hop, slide, or swim), changes in the retinal image create patterns of local velocities that provide additional cues to 3-D shape. Since any retinal image can result from projections of many different 3-D objects, the brain relies on prior assumptions to infer the correct shape. Previous studies have only looked at rigid objects and used shape inference models based either on the brain assuming that the object is rigid or that faster points are nearer. We will use novel stimuli that put these prior assumptions in conflict, and thus examine how the brain potentiates a prior. This section will culminate in a model for choosing between conflicting assumptions, something that is often required in perception and cognition. Next, we will use randomly deforming non-rigid 3-D waves to examine how global shape properties, e.g. symmetry, influence perceived object motions by selectively combining disparate outputs of motion sensitive neurons. These results will unveil interactions between the form and motion cortical systems. Finally, we will examine observers' percepts of dynamic shape changes that require more sophisticated analyses of retinal velocity patterns. Neurons in the motion sensitive cortical area MT respond to 1-D motion shear and compression/divergence, so we will extract these qualities and combine them into 2-D velocity patterns of divergence, rotation, and deformation. Neural filters formed by these patterns will be used to explain perceived changes in 3-D shapes. We will base our filters on responses of MT and later cortical neurons to our stimuli, measured in a parallel project. We will thus present the first neural model that can explain observers' percepts of both rigid and non-rigid textured objects. The performance of our model will be compared against the best computer-vision models on motion-capture data from real deforming objects. We expect this project to introduce new ideas, methods and results for understanding visual perception of 3-D shapes and its deficits in neurological patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously. This project will identify how the brain constructs correct and incorrect shape percepts of 3-D objects from texture and motion information. In addition, people with amblyopia, strabismus and convergence-insufficiency often have deficient stereo vision, so they find texture and motion information to be particularly useful in perceiving 3-D shapes, hence our work on separating velocity information into object motion, object shape, and shape deformation may be particularly useful to these people.                  Shape is probably the most important cue for recognizing objects, so neurological disorders related to shape- perception would severely impair the ability of such patients to function autonomously.

"Object Concepts  Project Summary What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.  Narrative Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world. Concepts organize our experiences, and they alter perception, memory, language, and action. The goal of this project is to understand the way in which conceptual knowledge is organized and the manner in which it is implemented in the brain. We will apply innovative neuroscientific methods to discover how we learn about the objects around us and how we access that information when remembering those objects.",Object Concepts,8312494,R01EY021717,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Solutions', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'austin', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mental representation', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,393921,0.06003844167040062
"CRCNS: Neural Reprensentation of Hierarchical Visual Concepts in Natural Scenes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of natural images is potentially enormous: the number of possible images that can be described by a smallish (100 by 100 pixels) picture is practically infinite (10000256), more than all the images the human race has ever witnessed during its entire existence. How can any system process input data of this magnitude of dimensions and interpret/understand it in terms of the estimated 200,000 objects in the world, their spatial layouts, and scene structures? Yet, this is a task that human visual systems routinely perform in a fraction of a second. The secret must lie in the fact that natural images are highly redundant, living in a restricted space inside this universe of almost infinite possibilities, and that mammalian visual systems have discovered and exploited this fact. In particular, we conjecture that neurons and populations are tuned to the statistical structure of natural images, building on previous work showing, for example, that sparse coding ideas can help predict receptive field properties of 'simple cells' in the visual cortex. This proposal has three stages. Firstly, we will perform a statistical analysis of natural images to classify and model the types of visual patches that appear. This will result in a stimulus dictionary, which will be used as stimuli to investigate the tuning properties of neurons and neuronal populations, and a visual concept dictionary which will be used to make predictions for the tuning properties. Secondly, we will perform multielectrode neurophysiological investigation of the tuning properties of neurons, and neuron populations, at different levels of the visual cortex in response to the stimulus dictionary. Thirdly, we will perform data analysis to model the tuning properties of neurons and populations using a combination of model-driven, which assumes that neurons are tuned to statistical properties of images, and data-driven approaches which can be thought of as learning 'neural visual concepts' directly from the neuron's response to the stimuli. Our theoretical approach - for learning the stimuli dictionary, the visual concepts, and performing data analysis - is based on statistical and machine learning techniques. These assume a hierarchical compositional structure for the data which offers the possibility of taming the complexity of natural images and is also consistent with the known hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. Intellectual merit: This research will help understand the structure of natural images, determine models for the tuning properties of neurons in the visual cortex, and develop novel data analysis techniques. It has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the statistical structures of natural images and the neural encoding of these structures, including the population level. This will lead to greater understanding of the visual cortex and also help the development of computer vision systems. Broader impacts: This project is interdisciplinary in nature and should have broad impact in multiple disciplines: neuroscience and biological vision, statistical neural data analysis, computer vision, and machine learning. Understanding neuronal properties in the visual cortex is a pre-requisite to the clinical enterprise of developing therapeutic methods and prosthetic devices for the visually impaired. The proposed research program will help facilitate a new graduate program in Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience at UCLA, an inter-college undergraduate minor in Neural Computation at CMU that the investigators are developing at their respective universities. The investigators also plan to organize workshops in NIPS, COSYNE, as well as to integrate their research into both undergraduate and graduate curriculum in their respective universities. This work will also affect undergraduate students at other colleges, by a summer undergraduate training program in Pittsburgh, another at CMU's Qatar campus. In addition, we will propose a workshop and summer school at IPAM (UCLA). We anticipate that this research will lead to invited lectures, peer reviewed publications and, if successful, will have national and international impact.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,8139754,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'meetings', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2011,219694,0.09252765803615118
"The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vision is central to our interactions with the world. Aside from recognizing faces and communicating with people, our daily activities are also organized around two fundamental tasks: recognizing our environment and navigating through it. The research program of Dr. Aude Oliva constitutes a new integration of behavioral, computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene perception. A growing body of evidence from behavioral, imaging and computational investigations has shown that the perception of complex real-world scenes engages distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms from those engaged in object recognition. To date, however, this evidence has not resulted in a comprehensive framework for understanding scene processing.  Here, the PI proposes to test the novel hypothesis that real-world scene analysis is performed in a network of distinctive brain regions, with each region specialized in representing a different level of scene information. Since scenes are inherently three-dimensional spaces, she will show that the brain capitalizes on information uniquely derived from the space encompassed by a scene, rather than an exclusively object-based description. In other words, before knowing the ""gist of a scene,"" we analyze the ""gist of the space.""  Understanding the nature of the brain's representations of visual scenes is an enterprise that will push the development of fast and reliable rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual and spatial impairments, and push forward the development of aid-based systems that rely on an understanding of the visual space. Real-world scene recognition is an unsolved mystery that will have implications for neuroscience, computational vision, artificial intelligence, robotics and psychology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program constitutes a new integration of computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene and space perception, with the aim of unraveling how the understanding of visual environments (where we are, where to navigate) arises in the human brain.           The research program constitutes a new integration of computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene and space perception, with the aim of unraveling how the understanding of visual environments (where we are, where to navigate) arises in the human brain.         ",The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception,8039320,R01EY020484,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Space Perception', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'programs', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2011,404890,0.09088092022857845
"Learning and Compression in Human Working  Memory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An important, yet relatively unexplored aspect of learning and working memory is how, and under what conditions, a perceiver can capitalize on regularities in the environment to remember more information. How can our prior experiences influence how we remember our current experiences? How can such influences be exploited as tools to enhance cognitive processes in those with learning disabilities (e.g., in Autism), or to assist those with memory deficits? To address these issues, this proposal makes use of a powerful form of implicit learning known as visual statistical learning. Previous research has shown that observers are extremely sensitive to regularities in the visual environment (e.g., quickly learning that 'A' is usually followed by 'B'). Surprisingly, this learning is often completely implicit: when asked to explicitly report these regularities observers perform at chance. This implies that visual statistical learning is a powerful process that operates automatically without our intent or conscious control. However, it remains unclear what the benefits of visual statistical learning are for memory processes. In particular, statistical regularities are a form of redundancy, and to the extent that human memory compresses redundant information, learning regularities between objects should enable observers to remember information about more objects. The proposed experiments have three aims: (1) to determine whether visual statistical learning enables observers to compress information and remember more, (2) to determine the ""units"" of compression, and (3) to determine the ""level"" at which compression occurs. To investigate these issues, observers will be required to remember simple objects. Over time, some observers will see patterns in the input (e.g., 'A' often occurs with 'B'), while other observers will see random input. To the extent that observers can learn regularities, and compress them to form more efficient memory representations, observers in the patterned group should remember details about more objects. Previous research has not directly explored how visual statistical learning impacts the capacity of working memory, and the proposed studies will provide important insight into the interactions between learning and memory.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An exciting aspect of this proposal is that it promises to inform basic science by studying how statistical learning impacts working memory and cognition, and therefore has potential to increase understanding of mental illnesses with learning or memory related symptoms. For instance, individuals with Autism have certain learning deficits, but it is unknown whether statistical learning, and its interaction with working memory, is impaired in Autism as well. The proposed studies lay the groundwork for future clinical translational research addressing such questions.           Project Narrative An exciting aspect of this proposal is that it promises to inform basic science by studying how statistical learning impacts working memory and cognition, and therefore has potential to increase understanding of mental illnesses with learning or memory related symptoms.

"Perception of Tactile Graphics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad objective of the proposed research is to answer the following question: why are tactile graphics difficult to understand? People with normal vision can easily recognize line drawings of objects. However, both blind and sighted people find it very difficult to recognize the same drawings when they are presented as tactile images. For blind people, tactile graphics are the only solution for accessing information in visual diagrams and illustrations found in textbooks. Consequently, the results of the proposed research will be used to improve the production of tactile graphics so that they are better understood by blind people. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) explore how the complexity of tactile images affects perception, 2) determine the effects of spatial and temporal integration on perception of tactile images, and 3) investigate how well people can recognize tactile images of objects embedded in backgrounds. The general methodology of the proposed experiments is to present participants with tactile images and to have them draw what they perceive the images to be. Blind individuals will draw tactile images using special paper and a stylus. The experimenters will evaluate the drawings by using a quantitative measure that computes a distance score reflecting the discrepancy between the original image and the participant's drawing. In the first study, participants will feel tactile stimuli of varying complexity, from simple lines in different orientations to complex depictions of objects. The second study will determine the limitations of tactile perceptual integration by limiting either the spatial or temporal window over which participants feel the image. Participants will either view or feel images through apertures of various sizes (spatial window) or they will have a limited amount of time to view or feel the images (temporal window). In the third study, participants will feel tactile images of objects embedded in simple backgrounds. This research will impact several areas of study, including computer vision, human object and scene recognition, and low vision rehabilitation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance The proposed research seeks to improve the translation of visual graphics into tactile graphics for use by visually-impaired individuals. By making the information in visual graphics more accessible, this research will improve educational services for people with low vision. This work will also facilitate the development of better visual-to-tactile substitution technologies.              Relevance The proposed research seeks to improve the translation of visual graphics into tactile graphics for use by visually-impaired individuals.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning.

"Object Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world.

"Towards cortical visual prosthetics    Description (provided by applicant): Visual object recognition is crucial for most everyday tasks including face identification, reading and navigation. In spite of the massive increase in computational power over the last two decades, a 3-year-old still outperforms the most sophisticated algorithms even in simple recognition tasks. Understanding the computations performed by the human visual system to recognize objects will have profound implications not only to understand the functions (and malfunction) of the cerebral cortex but also for developing visual prosthetic devices for the visually impaired. We combine neurophysiology, electrical stimulation and tools from machine learning to further our understanding of the neuronal circuits, algorithms and computations performed by the human visual system to perform visual pattern recognition. In the vast majority of visually impaired or blind people, the problems originate at the level of the retina while the visual cortex remains unimpaired. Our proposal constitutes a proof- of-principle approach towards developing visual prosthetic devices that rely on electrical stimulation of visual cortex. The specific aims of this proposal are designed to test the possibility of decoding and recoding information in visual cortex: (1) Read-out of visual information from human visual cortex on line (2) Write-in of visual information in human visual cortex. We take advantage of a rare opportunity to study the human brain at high spatial and temporal resolution by studying patients who have electrodes implanted for clinical reasons. Our electrophysiological recordings provide us with a unique view of the human temporal lobe circuitry and allow us to test the feasibility of cortical visual prosthetics in behaving human subjects.

"Learning and Compression in Human Working  Memory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An important, yet relatively unexplored aspect of learning and working memory is how, and under what conditions, a perceiver can capitalize on regularities in the environment to remember more information. How can our prior experiences influence how we remember our current experiences? How can such influences be exploited as tools to enhance cognitive processes in those with learning disabilities (e.g., in Autism), or to assist those with memory deficits? To address these issues, this proposal makes use of a powerful form of implicit learning known as visual statistical learning. Previous research has shown that observers are extremely sensitive to regularities in the visual environment (e.g., quickly learning that 'A' is usually followed by 'B'). Surprisingly, this learning is often completely implicit: when asked to explicitly report these regularities observers perform at chance. This implies that visual statistical learning is a powerful process that operates automatically without our intent or conscious control. However, it remains unclear what the benefits of visual statistical learning are for memory processes. In particular, statistical regularities are a form of redundancy, and to the extent that human memory compresses redundant information, learning regularities between objects should enable observers to remember information about more objects. The proposed experiments have three aims: (1) to determine whether visual statistical learning enables observers to compress information and remember more, (2) to determine the ""units"" of compression, and (3) to determine the ""level"" at which compression occurs. To investigate these issues, observers will be required to remember simple objects. Over time, some observers will see patterns in the input (e.g., 'A' often occurs with 'B'), while other observers will see random input. To the extent that observers can learn regularities, and compress them to form more efficient memory representations, observers in the patterned group should remember details about more objects. Previous research has not directly explored how visual statistical learning impacts the capacity of working memory, and the proposed studies will provide important insight into the interactions between learning and memory.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An exciting aspect of this proposal is that it promises to inform basic science by studying how statistical learning impacts working memory and cognition, and therefore has potential to increase understanding of mental illnesses with learning or memory related symptoms. For instance, individuals with Autism have certain learning deficits, but it is unknown whether statistical learning, and its interaction with working memory, is impaired in Autism as well. The proposed studies lay the groundwork for future clinical translational research addressing such questions.           Project Narrative An exciting aspect of this proposal is that it promises to inform basic science by studying how statistical learning impacts working memory and cognition, and therefore has potential to increase understanding of mental illnesses with learning or memory related symptoms.

"Mobile Search for the Visually Impaired    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    IQ Engines' mobile visual search technology will enable the visually impaired to access real-time information about physical objects using their mobile phone camera. The mobile phone provides a visually-driven hyperlink between the physical and digital world: point the camera at an object and get information (for example product information or navigation information). The mobile phone camera is a powerful yet underutilized tool for the visually impaired. Our proposal has two specific aims. Working directly with the visually impaired community, we will build a prototype mobile visual search application that meets their accessibility and use requirements. Our second aim is to improve upon the state of the art for 3D object recognition. We will investigate a novel combination of sparse image representation, feature matching algorithm, and geometric verification in order to advance the performance of 3D object matching. While state-of-the-art image intelligence is robust enough to enable rapid and accurate image search of flat feature-rich objects, current computer vision pales in comparison to the abilities of biological vision systems to recognize 3-dimensional objects. Our underlying goal is to bring inspiration from recent advances in theoretical neuroscience and apply them to image and video search solutions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Mobile visual search, using a cell phone camera to retrieve object information, enables a mobile phone camera to become an artificial 'eye' with object recognition intelligence.

"Origins of Object Knowledge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twelve experiments investigate the early development, in human infants, of perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. The experiments focus on a time during ontogeny when there may be evidence of visual sensitivity to information specifying object properties, but limited ability to perceive occlusion, with the goal of observing real-time processes by which the infant assembles visible parts of a stimulus into a coherent whole. This approach stipulates that onset of sensitivity to motion and orientation information, development of the oculomotor system, and experience viewing objects undergoing occlusion and disocclusion, play a direct, foundational role in the ontogeny of object perception. That is, there is an hypothesized period, 2 to 4 months of age, during which infants come to use newly-emerged visual skills to perceive objects accurately.   The experiments follow a similar strategy: explorations of individual and group differences in both basic visual processing skills and perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. Infant perception is assessed with two methods: (a) recording of eye movements, to measure improvements in pickup of important visual .information, and (b) habituation/dishabituation, to ascertain perception of object unity as well as to determine the extent of sensitivity to available visual information. It is expected that the detailed analysis of individual differences afforded by this approach provide the opportunity for exceptionally sensitive measures of the emergence of visual skills and object knowledge.   The short-term objectives of the present proposal are to elucidate fundamental developmental mechanisms in the context of the classic nature-nurture debate. The long-term goals are to shed light on the larger question of how knowledge is acquired and structured in the human, and how perceptual skills impact knowledge acquisition and structure. In the future, such understanding may aid in the formulation of diagnostics and treatments for some developmental disorders.         n/a",Origins of Object Knowledge,7783780,R01HD040432,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Birth', 'Budgets', 'Categories', 'Child Development', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Saccades', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Side', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'gaze', 'graduate student', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'information processing', 'meter', 'object perception', 'oculomotor', 'psychologic', 'research study', 'sequence learning', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2010,270932,0.12077055732477435
"Perceptual bases of visual concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our general aim is to discover how the brain processes visual information, how neural activity is related to visual perception, and how visual processing interacts with other brain systems underlying cognition. Our specific aim is to elucidate how pigeons recognize and conceptualize visual stimuli. By studying the pigeon-a highly visual animal which can readily learn, but which does not have language or a mammalian neocortex and whose history can be carefully controlled and systematically varied-the processes of visual recognition and conceptualization may be more quickly and readily discovered. If the visual discrimination behavior of pigeons resembles that of humans, then the processes of conceptualization may be mediated by common neurobiological mechanisms which do not depend on linguistic competence or the human brain. The pigeon may become a powerful model system for both behavioral and biological studies of complex visual processing. Our proposal aims to see whether the perceptual processes of recognition and conceptualization are similar in humans and pigeons. Pigeons will be trained with several different operant conditioning procedures to discriminate line drawings and computer renderings of natural and artificial stimuli. The pigeons will later be tested with stimuli that: (1) degrade the training stimuli, (2) rearrange its parts, and (3) rotate the image in depth. These test stimuli produce highly specific effects in humans, which encourage the idea that object recognition is mediated by a structural description specifying a neural representation of the object's parts and the relations among those parts. If people and pigeons similarly process these various visual stimuli, then the results of our experiments with pigeons should parallel those with people. Empirical convergence would attest to the economy of nature and to the superfluity of language for visual recognition and conceptualization. Empirical divergence would imply that different neurobiological or linguistic mechanisms mediate visual recognition and conceptualization in people and pigeons. In either case, the results of this research project should shed considerable light on the basic mechanisms of visual recognition and conceptualization. Beyond the scientific significance of our proposed research, its health relevancy is considerable. Developing sound animal models of object recognition and conceptualization might better enable us to understand the behavioral and biological mechanisms of the human visual system in both health and disease. Effective animal models may also help pave the way for devising nonverbal diagnostic tests for assessing visual performance. In addition, comparing how pigeons and people recognize objects could provide new insights for computer and cognitive scientists to construct artificial devices which can recognize complex stimuli in the real world. Discovering how different biological systems accomplish the same adaptive feat might greatly help those attempting to create different artificial and prosthetic systems of object recognition. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of animal models of object recognition and visual conceptualization might better enable us to understand the behavioral and biological mechanisms of the human visual system in both health and disease. Effective animal models may also help pave the way for devising practical diagnostic tests for assessing visual performance; particularly important here is the fact that verbal behavior need not participate in such performance assessments, making nonverbal tests especially useful with infants, young children, and clinical populations. Our results should also advance our understanding of how the visual system develops and how to promote its regeneration after disease or injury.           Relevance to Public Health The development of animal models of object recognition and visual conceptualization might better enable us to understand the behavioral and biological mechanisms of the human visual system in both health and disease.

"Causal Perceptual Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to make original contributions to scientific understanding of biological perception. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a causal model of touch sensations' integration with visual sensations for perception, and to generalize this model for application to a broader class of sensory integration phenomena, 2) apply causal models to investigate how humans perceive cause-and-effect events, 3) increase the applicant's technical proficiency with causal modeling and applied machine learning methods. The proposal includes two main projects; the first will measure how humans judge the size of objects when their distances are uncertain. Specifically the first project examines the theory that human perception uses knowledge about how size and distance sensations are caused to integrate related sensations. Human experimental participants will view objects while touching them and report their perceptions of the objects' sizes, which will be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. The second project investigates how humans perceive cause-and-effect chains of events by examining the theory that the brain uses built-in knowledge of rudimentary physical behaviors, like momentum in collisions, to interpret such simple events. Human experimental participants will view colliding objects and report what occurred, which will again be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this research is to increase scientific and medical understanding of the neural communication and processing strategies the brain employs to create perceptual experiences, so that people with perceptual impairments can be provided with effective rehabilitation programs and biotechnological substitutes for diminished capabilities. Specific impairments include blindness and low-vision, traumatic brain and nervous system injuries, and strokes.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,7692268,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'meetings', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2009,228847,0.09252765803615118
"Towards cortical visual prosthetics    Description (provided by applicant): Visual object recognition is crucial for most everyday tasks including face identification, reading and navigation. In spite of the massive increase in computational power over the last two decades, a 3-year-old still outperforms the most sophisticated algorithms even in simple recognition tasks. Understanding the computations performed by the human visual system to recognize objects will have profound implications not only to understand the functions (and malfunction) of the cerebral cortex but also for developing visual prosthetic devices for the visually impaired. We combine neurophysiology, electrical stimulation and tools from machine learning to further our understanding of the neuronal circuits, algorithms and computations performed by the human visual system to perform visual pattern recognition. In the vast majority of visually impaired or blind people, the problems originate at the level of the retina while the visual cortex remains unimpaired. Our proposal constitutes a proof- of-principle approach towards developing visual prosthetic devices that rely on electrical stimulation of visual cortex. The specific aims of this proposal are designed to test the possibility of decoding and recoding information in visual cortex: (1) Read-out of visual information from human visual cortex on line (2) Write-in of visual information in human visual cortex. We take advantage of a rare opportunity to study the human brain at high spatial and temporal resolution by studying patients who have electrodes implanted for clinical reasons.

"Perceptual bases of visual concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our general aim is to discover how the brain processes visual information, how neural activity is related to visual perception, and how visual processing interacts with other brain systems underlying cognition. Our specific aim is to elucidate how pigeons recognize and conceptualize visual stimuli. By studying the pigeon-a highly visual animal which can readily learn, but which does not have language or a mammalian neocortex and whose history can be carefully controlled and systematically varied-the processes of visual recognition and conceptualization may be more quickly and readily discovered. If the visual discrimination behavior of pigeons resembles that of humans, then the processes of conceptualization may be mediated by common neurobiological mechanisms which do not depend on linguistic competence or the human brain. The pigeon may become a powerful model system for both behavioral and biological studies of complex visual processing. Our proposal aims to see whether the perceptual processes of recognition and conceptualization are similar in humans and pigeons. Pigeons will be trained with several different operant conditioning procedures to discriminate line drawings and computer renderings of natural and artificial stimuli. The pigeons will later be tested with stimuli that: (1) degrade the training stimuli, (2) rearrange its parts, and (3) rotate the image in depth. These test stimuli produce highly specific effects in humans, which encourage the idea that object recognition is mediated by a structural description specifying a neural representation of the object's parts and the relations among those parts. If people and pigeons similarly process these various visual stimuli, then the results of our experiments with pigeons should parallel those with people. Empirical convergence would attest to the economy of nature and to the superfluity of language for visual recognition and conceptualization. Empirical divergence would imply that different neurobiological or linguistic mechanisms mediate visual recognition and conceptualization in people and pigeons. In either case, the results of this research project should shed considerable light on the basic mechanisms of visual recognition and conceptualization. Beyond the scientific significance of our proposed research, its health relevancy is considerable. Developing sound animal models of object recognition and conceptualization might better enable us to understand the behavioral and biological mechanisms of the human visual system in both health and disease. Effective animal models may also help pave the way for devising nonverbal diagnostic tests for assessing visual performance. In addition, comparing how pigeons and people recognize objects could provide new insights for computer and cognitive scientists to construct artificial devices which can recognize complex stimuli in the real world. Discovering how different biological systems accomplish the same adaptive feat might greatly help those attempting to create different artificial and prosthetic systems of object recognition. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of animal models of object recognition and visual conceptualization might better enable us to understand the behavioral and biological mechanisms of the human visual system in both health and disease. Effective animal models may also help pave the way for devising practical diagnostic tests for assessing visual performance; particularly important here is the fact that verbal behavior need not participate in such performance assessments, making nonverbal tests especially useful with infants, young children, and clinical populations.

"Causal Perceptual Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to make original contributions to scientific understanding of biological perception. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a causal model of touch sensations' integration with visual sensations for perception, and to generalize this model for application to a broader class of sensory integration phenomena, 2) apply causal models to investigate how humans perceive cause-and-effect events, 3) increase the applicant's technical proficiency with causal modeling and applied machine learning methods. The proposal includes two main projects; the first will measure how humans judge the size of objects when their distances are uncertain. Specifically the first project examines the theory that human perception uses knowledge about how size and distance sensations are caused to integrate related sensations. Human experimental participants will view objects while touching them and report their perceptions of the objects' sizes, which will be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. The second project investigates how humans perceive cause-and-effect chains of events by examining the theory that the brain uses built-in knowledge of rudimentary physical behaviors, like momentum in collisions, to interpret such simple events. Human experimental participants will view colliding objects and report what occurred, which will again be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this research is to increase scientific and medical understanding of the neural communication and processing strategies the brain employs to create perceptual experiences, so that people with perceptual impairments can be provided with effective rehabilitation programs and biotechnological substitutes for diminished capabilities. Specific impairments include blindness and low-vision, traumatic brain and nervous system injuries, and strokes. In particular, modern sensory prostheses are now using computerized components that can interface with neural pathways to more comprehensively and effectively restore normal abilities in patients, and whose development faces significant obstacles establishing effective communication channels with the biological nervous system.          n/a",Causal Perceptual Processing,7545242,F32EY019228,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Class', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Distance Perception', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plague', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Water', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'computer monitor', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'experience', 'falls', 'haptics', 'insight', 'object perception', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'sensory prosthesis', 'size', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2008,44846,0.041452623817303434
"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          n/a",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,7388324,R01EY013988,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cataract', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family history of', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rotation', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'area MT', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'concept', 'congenital cataract', 'design', 'devices for the visually impaired', 'experience', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'size', 'stereoscopic', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2008,228847,0.09252765803615118
"Population analysis of shape representation in V4    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The perception of shape is essential for object identification and visually guided action. The neural represenation of shape is mediated by a hierarchical system of brain areas known collectively as the ventral stream. Damage to ventral stream areas may lead to visual agnosias that can severely compromise quality of life. It is therefore important to achieve an understanding of how shape representation is generated. We will examine the neural representation of shape in V4, a brain region that is situated at an intermediate level on the ventral stream hierarchy. Our stategy will be to construct quantitative models of the relationship between neurophysiological activity and visual input at both the single cell and population levels. Our approach to constructing these models will be distinguished by the use of advanced non-linear statistical techniques, complex visual stimuli that simulates natural viewing conditions, and the use of multi-electrode arrays to record populations of neurons simultaneously. Interpretation and analysis of these models will allow us adress two specific questions: 1) what are the independent stimulus dimensions to which V4 neurons are tuned?; 2) how is the distributed activity of V4 cell populations combined to represent shape?           n/a",Population analysis of shape representation in V4,7483599,F32EY016941,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrodes', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'V4 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Agnosias', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'area V4', 'base', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'neurophysiology', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'visual search', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2008,50428,0.05930501822578461
"Shape representation and attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the way the visual system processes complex shape. We focus on two intermediate visual areas, V2 and V4, located in the ventral processing stream immediately beyond primary visual cortex (area VI). These areas serve as the major input stages for higher-order shape processing areas in the temporal cortex. We propose neurophysiological experiments to investigate the way that shape is represented in these areas and the way that attention modulates these representations. Shape is difficult to describe and parameterize, so previous neurophysiological studies of shape processing have utilized simple, regular shapes that are experimentally convenient. However, intermediate shape processing is highly nonlinear, so results obtained with reduced stimulus sets may not generalize to other stimuli. We therefore propose to use both complex, natural stimuli and simpler stimuli such as gratings. To facilitate this, we are developing novel nonlinear regression algorithms to estimate the stimulus-response mapping functions of neurons in V2 and V4. The underlying shape dimensions represented therein can then be determined by applying visualization algorithms (developed in our laboratory) to the stimulus-response mapping functions estimated for single neurons. In another series of experiments we plan to investigate how extrastriate visual areas integrate information from earlier sensory areas. Finally, we propose to examine how visual attention affects shape representations in V2 and V4. We will accomplish this by quantifying the effects of selective attention to a specific shape (feature attention) and attention directed toward a specific location in space (spatial attention) on neuronal tuning curves. Successful completion of these projects will provide critical information to aid in development of quantitative computational models of shape processing in intermediate vision. n/a",Shape representation and attention,7386606,R01EY012241,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease regression', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Space Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Training', 'V4 neuron', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Width', 'area V2', 'area striata', 'directed attention', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'improved', 'movie', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'selective attention', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual search']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,355274,0.061008342865988795
"Transmission of Information in the Visual System How do we identify an object from the features that we detect? Understanding how the brain recognizes objects might give insight into how the brain solves problems in general. The object recognition problem has withstood a century of attempts, but we bring new tools ¿ fruits of the last grant period ¿ that allow us to sketch the outlines of a solution. Four approaches, all new and different, converge on one answer. AIM 1. Use crowding, along with other manipulations, to characterize three parallel processes in reading by normal and dyslexic readers. AIM 2. Count features by probability summation. Extending traditional probability summation from explaining just detection to also explain object identification, we acquire a new tool, allowing us to count the number of features the observer must detect in order to identify. AIM 3. Capture the observer's classification algorithm by computer modeling of the observer's responses to thousands of letters in white noise. We use statistical learning theory to build a classifier that accounts for human performance. The observer classifies each of several thousand images of a letter in noise as ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"", etc. These classifications are data that can tell us what the observer is doing. We use a powerful statistical learning algorithm to create a simple classifier that best models human performance. AIM 4. fMRI: Where in the brain are letters identified?

"Origins of Object Knowledge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twelve experiments investigate the early development, in human infants, of perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. The experiments focus on a time during ontogeny when there may be evidence of visual sensitivity to information specifying object properties, but limited ability to perceive occlusion, with the goal of observing real-time processes by which the infant assembles visible parts of a stimulus into a coherent whole. This approach stipulates that onset of sensitivity to motion and orientation information, development of the oculomotor system, and experience viewing objects undergoing occlusion and disocclusion, play a direct, foundational role in the ontogeny of object perception. That is, there is an hypothesized period, 2 to 4 months of age, during which infants come to use newly-emerged visual skills to perceive objects accurately. The experiments follow a similar strategy: explorations of individual and group differences in both basic visual processing skills and perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. Infant perception is assessed with two methods: (a) recording of eye movements, to measure improvements in pickup of important visual .information, and (b) habituation/dishabituation, to ascertain perception of object unity as well as to determine the extent of sensitivity to available visual information. It is expected that the detailed analysis of individual differences afforded by this approach provide the opportunity for exceptionally sensitive measures of the emergence of visual skills and object knowledge. The short-term objectives of the present proposal are to elucidate fundamental developmental mechanisms in the context of the classic nature-nurture debate. The long-term goals are to shed light on the larger question of how knowledge is acquired and structured in the human, and how perceptual skills impact knowledge acquisition and structure.

"Visual statistical learning in human infants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program of research is to determine how the developing human infant forms representations of the visual world. The focus of the research is on a class of powerful learning mechanisms that have been shown by the Principal Investigator and his colleagues to rapidly extract from sequences of auditory stimuli the statistical properties that form coherent units (e.g., words and melodies). Visual statistical learning will be studied to determine whether a similarly powerful set of mechanisms is present in a modality other than audition. Infants ranging in age from 3- to 12-months of age, as well as adults, will be tested on a variety of statistical learning tasks in which small visual shapes are arranged into scenes. At issue is how infants and adults learn that some of these shapes appear together (co-occur) across many different scenes, forming the basic building blocks for representing those scenes in memory. Four different techniques will be used with infants. The primary technique involves the repeated presentation of a sequence of 16-28 different scenes composed of 3-6 different shapes. After a decline in looking time (habituation) to these displays, infants will be presented with test displays containing coherent (high statistical relatedness) and incoherent (unrelated) shapes that were embedded in the scenes. The other three techniques involve forced-choice preferential looking, automated corneal reflection eye-tracking, and anticipatory eye-movements to learned categories. These techniques will be used to determine whether newly learned features activate attention in cluttered scenes, how these features are learned when low-level properties of the scenes compete for attention, how variations over time in the input statistics affect the accuracy of feature learning, and how other perceptual constraints affect feature learning. A key hypothesis of the Pl's statistical approach will be tested -- that learners represent the largest coherent unit in a complex array of elements, rather than also representing all of the embedded elements that are redundant with this larger unit. Taken together, these proposed studies will reveal how infants and adults learn new information from complex visual scenes and represent that information in a computationally efficient manner. Failure to learn efficiently could lead to deficits in the early phases of learning in infancy and negatively affect the formation of higher level categories.         n/a",Visual statistical learning in human infants,7173447,R01HD037082,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Attention', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Clutterings', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cornea', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Infant', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'detector', 'infancy', 'object perception', 'programs', 'research study', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'visual control', 'visual learning', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2007,230302,0.012284456810917856
"The formation of visual objects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Perceptual grouping is the process by which the initially raw and inchoate visual image is organized into perceptual ""objects"". What spatial factors induce perceptual grouping? What is the sequence of computations whereby the image is progressively organized? One source of difficulty in modeling this process is that, unlike many aspects of early vision, perceptual grouping inherently involves non-local: computations - integration of cues from potentially distant locations in the image. Another difficulty in understanding perceptual grouping has been the lack of objective and temporally precise methods for actually measuring the observer's subjective organization of an image. This proposal seeks to combine (a) recent advances in understanding the non-local computations involved in perceptual grouping with (b) novel experimental methods for determining subjective organization.

"Shape representation and attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the way the visual system processes complex shape. We focus on two intermediate visual areas, V2 and V4, located in the ventral processing stream immediately beyond primary visual cortex (area VI). These areas serve as the major input stages for higher-order shape processing areas in the temporal cortex. We propose neurophysiological experiments to investigate the way that shape is represented in these areas and the way that attention modulates these representations. Shape is difficult to describe and parameterize, so previous neurophysiological studies of shape processing have utilized simple, regular shapes that are experimentally convenient. However, intermediate shape processing is highly nonlinear, so results obtained with reduced stimulus sets may not generalize to other stimuli. We therefore propose to use both complex, natural stimuli and simpler stimuli such as gratings. To facilitate this, we are developing novel nonlinear regression algorithms to estimate the stimulus-response mapping functions of neurons in V2 and V4. The underlying shape dimensions represented therein can then be determined by applying visualization algorithms (developed in our laboratory) to the stimulus-response mapping functions estimated for single neurons. In another series of experiments we plan to investigate how extrastriate visual areas integrate information from earlier sensory areas. Finally, we propose to examine how visual attention affects shape representations in V2 and V4. We will accomplish this by quantifying the effects of selective attention to a specific shape (feature attention) and attention directed toward a specific location in space (spatial attention) on neuronal tuning curves. Successful completion of these projects will provide critical information to aid in development of quantitative computational models of shape processing in intermediate vision. n/a",Shape representation and attention,7189021,R01EY012241,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease regression', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Space Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Training', 'V4 neuron', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Width', 'area V2', 'area striata', 'directed attention', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'improved', 'movie', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'selective attention', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual search']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,363113,0.061008342865988795
"Origins of Object Knowledge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twelve experiments investigate the early development, in human infants, of perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. The experiments focus on a time during ontogeny when there may be evidence of visual sensitivity to information specifying object properties, but limited ability to perceive occlusion, with the goal of observing real-time processes by which the infant assembles visible parts of a stimulus into a coherent whole. This approach stipulates that onset of sensitivity to motion and orientation information, development of the oculomotor system, and experience viewing objects undergoing occlusion and disocclusion, play a direct, foundational role in the ontogeny of object perception. That is, there is an hypothesized period, 2 to 4 months of age, during which infants come to use newly-emerged visual skills to perceive objects accurately. The experiments follow a similar strategy: explorations of individual and group differences in both basic visual processing skills and perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. Infant perception is assessed with two methods: (a) recording of eye movements, to measure improvements in pickup of important visual .information, and (b) habituation/dishabituation, to ascertain perception of object unity as well as to determine the extent of sensitivity to available visual information. It is expected that the detailed analysis of individual differences afforded by this approach provide the opportunity for exceptionally sensitive measures of the emergence of visual skills and object knowledge. The short-term objectives of the present proposal are to elucidate fundamental developmental mechanisms in the context of the classic nature-nurture debate. The long-term goals are to shed light on the larger question of how knowledge is acquired and structured in the human, and how perceptual skills impact knowledge acquisition and structure. In the future, such understanding may aid in the formulation of diagnostics and treatments for some developmental disorders.         n/a",Origins of Object Knowledge,7212153,R01HD040432,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Birth', 'Budgets', 'Categories', 'Child Development', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer information processing', 'Condition', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Saccades', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Side', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Support of Research', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'concept', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'meter', 'object perception', 'oculomotor', 'psychologic', 'research study', 'sequence learning', 'size', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NICHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,272700,0.12077055732477435
"Perceptual Organization and Attention: Behavior & fMRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual perception is selective, and visual attention is the mechanism by which salient or high-priority objects are prioritized for awareness and action. Recent work has shown that attentional selection often operates on perceptual objects and not simply on spatial locations. In a multi-object scene involving partial occlusion, image regions must be grouped into coherent object representations prior to attentional deployment. The visual system employs a set of heuristics that serve to constrain object recognition based on principles of perceptual organization. Despite their importance to human navigation and behavior, knowledge of these heuristics and the neural mechanisms that underlie this process remain poorly understood. The proposed project will examine the grouping principles that are critical to object-based attentional selection, and will enumerate the dominance relations among these principles when they are consistent with competing groupings within a scene. The project also explores the neural implementation of these processes to extend our knowledge of the constraints built into the object recognition and visual attention systems. The combination of behavioral and neuroimaging methods outlined in this application will result in a better understanding of the neural circuitry that is responsible for efficient, goal-directed object recognition.           n/a",Perceptual Organization and Attention: Behavior & fMRI,7112773,F31NS055664,"['artificial intelligence', 'attention', 'behavior', 'clinical research', 'cues', 'visual perception']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2006,37861,0.12746338573945726

"RECOGNITION OF OBJECTS UNDER VARIABLE ILLUMINATION The goal of the proposed research is to develop and test a computational theory for the human ability to recognize objects under variable illumination (including extreme shadowing) and viewpoint changes. The ability to recognize objects is of fundamental importance in everyday life and the loss of this ability, due to a stroke or Alzheimer's disease, is a serious handicap to the person involved. The computational theory is based on a new paradigm for object representation --generative modeling - - in which an image-based model of an object is ""generated"" from a small set of training images. This theory has been demonstrated to successfully recognize objects from real images under extreme lighting variations.

"VISUAL OBJECT RECOGNITION OF CATEGORIES AND EXEMPLARS Fundamental to visual object recognition is the ability to recognize abstract categories of objects (e.g., cups versus pens) as well as specific exemplars within those categories (e.g., individual pens).  Interestingly, this ability poses a dilemma for the visual system: How can it recognize that two shapes should be considered the same (i.e., belong to the same abstract category) yet also different (i.e., correspond to different exemplars)?  The aim of the proposed work is to investigate how the human brain may implement a solution to this problems.  In particular, the goal is to uncover the architecture of functionally defined, neurally dissociable subsystems that underlie object recognition, and to determine whether this architecture reflects a solution to the abstract/specific dilemma.  Understanding the structure of component subsystems has primary importance, as it must be addressed before satisfactory answers can be offered for contemporary questions in this field; different answers may apply to different subsystems.  Preliminary studies indicate that dissociable subsystems learn to operate in parallel to accomplish abstract-category and specific-exemplar recognition of visual objects.  However, it is difficult to produce fail-safe dissociations of functionally specified subsystems, and other architectures remain viable as alternative theories (e.g., dissociable subsystems operating in sequence, a single general-purpose mechanism, attention to different information within a single subsystem).  Thus, the proposed research will further test and refine these theories, using a converging evidence attack to draw strong conclusions.  The research will integrate analyses of the goals of the visual system with evidence of the neural implementation of dissociable subsystems to constrain such theories.

"CRCNS: Probabilistic models of perceptual grouping/segmentation in natural vision   To understand and navigate the environment, sensory systems must solve simultaneously two competing and challenging tasks: the segmentation of a sensory scene into individual objects and the grouping of elementary sensory features to build these objects. Understanding perceptual grouping and segmentation is therefore a major goal of sensory neuroscience, and it is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision. To make progress in understanding image segmentation and improving algorithms, this project combines two key components.

"CRCNS: Probabilistic models of perceptual grouping/segmentation in natural vision   To understand and navigate the environment, sensory systems must solve simultaneously two competing and challenging tasks: the segmentation of a sensory scene into individual objects and the grouping of elementary sensory features to build these objects. Understanding perceptual grouping and segmentation is therefore a major goal of sensory neuroscience, and it is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision. To make progress in understanding image segmentation and improving algorithms, this project combines two key components.

"Guiding Attention in Real-World Scenes Project Summary Real-world scenes contain far more information than we can perceive at any given moment. Scene perception therefore requires attentional selection of relevant scene regions for prioritized processing. How are those aspects of the world that should receive priority selected? Although much past research has focused on how attention is guided by the visual properties of a scene, new evidence from meaning maps, developed in the previous funding period, established that the distribution of meaning across a scene plays a central and often dominant role in guiding attention. This surprising finding raises many important new questions about the nature of scene meaning and its specific role in attentional guidance. The overarching goal of this project is to understand in detail how the semantic features of a scene’s objects and functional spaces influence the guidance of visual attention in complex real-world scenes. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the role of object semantics in attentional guidance in scenes; (2) To determine the role of functional spaces in attentional guidance in scenes; (3) To determine how viewing task interacts with scene semantics in guiding attention. The project is innovative in expanding the traditional study of attention to explicitly consider the role of meaning. To this end, new semantic maps capitalizing on the meaning map concept will be used capture local region meaning continuously over a scene, allowing for direct investigation of the relationships of different types of meaning with attention. The project is innovative in (1) expanding the traditional study of visual attention to explicitly consider the role of semantics; (2) focusing on the semantics of both scene content (objects) and scene structure (space); (3) considering the role of meaning in attentional guidance in the context of viewing task; (4) integrating the use of a wide variety of cognitive science methods marshalled in the service of understanding the influence of meaning on visual attention in real-world scenes, including eyetracking, large-scale crowd-sourcing, computational image processing, computational semantic modeling, and deep convolutional neural networks. The project is significant in challenging current models of visual attention to account for the role of scene meaning. Because the proposed studies test competing models, the results will lead to the development of integrative theoretical frameworks that advance the field regardless of the outcome. While focused on basic science, the studies have potentially important translational implications by providing a more complete characterization of the processes associated with visual attention. The proposed studies may ultimately lead to the development of rehabilitation strategies for visual attention as it operates in the real world, better capitalizing on the use of a viewer’s knowledge to offset disrupted functions in those with attention and vision deficits. Project Narrative The visual world presents us with far more information than we can process at any given moment. How does the brain select those aspects of the world that should receive priority for visual analysis? This project investigates how we select and attend to meaningful information the natural environment given what we are currently trying to accomplish. The studies combine high-resolution eyetracking with models of meaning based on crowd-sourced human ratings, computer vision models of image processing, deep learning models of scene recognition and attention, and hybrid artificial intelligence models of complex concepts. The role of meaning in guiding attention is contrasted with the role of pre-semantic image features. The knowledge gained will increase our theoretical understanding of how visual attention and perception operate in complex meaningful scenes, assist in the identification of individuals with deficits in visual attention, and may ultimately lead to the development of targeted rehabilitation strategies for the real world.",Guiding Attention in Real-World Scenes,10049970,R01EY027792,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Esthetics', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Marshal', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior test', 'concept mapping', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'image processing', 'imaging properties', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'visual information', 'visual search']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,381403,0.07305565093999719
"Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure PROJECT SUMMARY Modern technology makes it possible to capture a visual scene as a photograph, alter it, send it to another country nearly instantaneously, and store it without concern for degradation. None of this is currently possible in olfaction. Although perfumers and flavorists are adept at mixing odorous molecules to produce a desired perceptual effect, the rules underlying this process are poorly understood at a quantitative level. Current methods for displaying odors to a subject are akin to requiring a Polaroid of every visual stimulus of interest. A more efficient method for probing the olfactory system would be to use a set of 'primary odors'—some limited number of odors from which all other complex odors could be reproduced by appropriate mixtures. Both auditory and visual stimuli have been digitized, and this will eventually be possible in olfaction as well. Predicting odor from chemical structure has been a problem in the field since its inception, but recent advances in machine learning algorithms have made great progress in analogous problems, such as facial recognition. The research proposed here will combine these machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to understand how to predict the smell of a molecule or mixture of odorants, which will ultimately help improve our understanding of disease diagnosis using odors as well as eating-related health and illness. HEALTH RELEVANCE The sense of smell plays a critical role in preferences and aversions for specific foods. The proposed research will combine machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to create a model that can predict the smell of odorous molecules. This model will allow us to describe and control odors, which will increase our understanding of food preference and eating-related health and wellness.",Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure,9887973,R01DC017757,"['Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-linear Models', 'Numerical value', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'computer monitor', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in silico', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'novel', 'physical property', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'preference', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'single molecule', 'visual stimulus']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,R01,2020,496911,0.0435795173042827
"Human Face Representation in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks The human visual system can recognize a familiar face across wide variations of viewpoint, illumination, expression, and appearance. This remarkable computational feat is accomplished by large-­scale networks of neurons. We will test a face space theory of the representations that emerge at the top layer of deep learning convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as a model of human visual representations of faces. Computer-based face recognition has improved in recent years due to DCNNs and the easy availability of labeled training data (faces and identities) from the web. Inspired by the primate visual system, DCNNs are feed­forward artificial neural networks that can map images of faces into representations that support recognition over widely variable images. Although the calculations executed by the simulated neurons are simple, enormous numbers of computations are used to convert an image into a representation. The end result of this processing is a highly compact representation of a face that retains image detail in an invariant, identity­-specific face code. This code is fundamentally different than any representation of faces considered in vision science. This theory we test combines key components of previous face space models (similarity, learning history) with new features (imaging conditions, personal face history) in a unitary space that represents both identity and facial appearance across variable images. We will test whether this model can account for human recognition of familiar faces, which is highly robust to image variability (pose, illumination, expression). The model will also be applied to understanding long standing difficulties humans (and machines) have with faces of other races. We aim to bridge critical gaps in our knowledge of how DCNNs work, linking psychological, neural, and computational perspectives. A fundamentally new theory of face representation will alter the questions we ask about face representations in all three fields. A new focus on understanding how we (or neural networks) “perceive” a single familiar identity in widely variable images will give rise to a search for representations that gracefully merge the properties of faces with the real-­world image conditions in which they are experienced. This project presents a unique opportunity to study, manipulate, and learn from these representations, and to apply the findings to broader questions about high-­level vision from neural and perceptual perspectives. Human recognition of familiar faces is highly robust to image variability (pose, illumination, expression)—a skill that is likely due to the quality and quantity of experience we have with the faces of people we know well. Deep convolutional neural networks are modeled after the primate visual system and have made impressive gains recently on the problem of robust face recognition. Understanding the visual nature of the face “feature” codes that emerge in these networks can give insight into long-standing questions about how the human visual system can, but does not always, represent a face in a way that generalizes across images that vary widely.",Human Face Representation in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,9873959,R01EY029692,"['Affect', 'Appearance', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Familiarity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Published Comment', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Space Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feedforward neural network', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural network', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'representation theory', 'skills', 'theories', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R01,2020,385203,0.05283108228702951
"Natural image processing in the visual cortex Project Summary Signals from the natural environment are processed by neuronal populations in the cortex. Understanding the relationship between those signals and cortical activity is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating cortical processing of simple, parametric stimuli, and computational technology is improving descriptions of neural responses to naturalistic stimuli. However, how cortical populations encode the complex, natural inputs received during every day perceptual experience is largely unknown. This project aims to elucidate how natural visual inputs are represented by neuronal populations in primary visual cortex (V1). Progress to date has been limited primarily by two factors. First, during natural vision, the inputs to V1 neurons are always embedded in a spatial and temporal context, but how V1 integrates this contextual information in natural visual inputs is poorly understood. Second, prior work focused almost exclusively on single-neuron firing rate, but to understand cortical representations one must consider the structure of population activity— the substantial trial-to-trial variability that is shared among neurons and evolves dynamically—as this structure influences population information and perception. The central hypothesis of this project is that cortical response structure is modulated by visual context to approximate an optimal representation of natural visual inputs. To test the hypothesis, this project combines machine learning to quantify the statistical properties of natural visual inputs, with a theory of how cortical populations should encode those images to achieve an optimal representation, to arrive at concrete, falsifiable predictions for V1 response structure. The predictions will be tested with measurements of population activity in V1 of awake monkeys viewing natural images and movies. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether modulation of V1 response structure by spatial context in static images is consistent with optimal encoding of those images, and will compare the predictive power of the proposed model to alternative models. Specific Aim 2 addresses V1 encoding of dynamic natural inputs, and will test whether modulation of V1 activity by temporal context is tuned to the temporal structure of natural sensory signals, as required for optimality. As both spatial and temporal are present simultaneously during natural vision, Specific Aim 3 will determine visual input statistics in free-viewing animals, and test space-time interactions in V1 activity evoked by those inputs. This project will provide the first test of a unified functional theory of contextual modulation in V1 encoding of natural visual inputs, and shed light on key aspects of natural vision that have been neglected to date. Project Narrative This project aims to determine how neurons in the visual cortex represent the inputs encountered during perceptual experience in the natural environment, through correct integration of visual information across space and time. In individuals with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, integration is often miscalibrated leading to perceptual impairments. Our study will advance knowledge of the relationship between natural sensory inputs and cortical activity, which is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in patient populations.",Natural image processing in the visual cortex,10018026,R01EY030578,"['Address', 'Animal Testing', 'Area', 'Complex', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'V1 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'model development', 'movie', 'neglect', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'theories', 'vision science', 'visual information']",NEI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,417500,0.06155718868771101
"Towards a Compositional Generative Model of Human Vision Understanding object recognition has long been a central problem in vision science, because of its applied utility and computational difficulty. Progress has been slow, because of an inability to process complex natural images, where the largest challenges arise. Recently, advances in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) spurred unprecedented success in natural image recognition. The general goal of this proposal is to leverage this success to test computational theories of human object recognition in natural images. However, DCNNs still markedly underperform humans when challenged with high levels of ambiguity, occlusion, and articulation. We hypothesize that humans' superior performance arises from the use of knowledge about how images and objects are structured. Preliminary evidence for this claim comes from the success of hybrid models, that combine DCNNS for identifying features and parts in images, with explicit knowledge of object and image structure. These computations occur within a hierarchy, which includes both top-down and bottom- up processing. The specific goal of the work proposed here is to strongly test whether these computational strategies, structured, hierarchical representations and bidirectional processing, are used to recognize objects in natural images. Human bodies are composed of hierarchically organized configurable parts, making them an ideal test domain. We examine the complete recognition process, from parts, to pairs of parts, to whole bodies, each in its own aim. Each aim also tests important sub-hypotheses about when and how the computational strategies are used. Aim 1 examines recognition of individual body parts, testing whether it is dependent on parsing images into more basic features and relationships, for example edges and materials. Aim 2 examines pairs of parts, testing the importance of knowledge of body connectedness relationships. Aim 3 examines perception of entire bodies, testing whether knowledge of global body structure guides bidirectional processing. In each aim, we first develop nested computer vision models that either do or do not make use of structural knowledge, to test whether it aids recognition. We then test whether human performance can be accounted for by the availability of that structural knowledge. We next measure neural activity with functional MRI to identify where and how it is used in cortex. Finally, we integrate these results to produce even stronger tests, using the nested models to predict human performance and confusion matrices as well as fMRI activity levels and confusion matrices. Altogether, this work will strongly test key theoretical accounts of object recognition in the most important domain, perception of natural images. The work, based on extensive preliminary data, measures and models the entire body recognition system. The models developed and tested here should surpass the state-of-the-art, and be useful for many real-world recognition tasks. The proposal will also lay the groundwork for future studies of recognition impaired by disease. This research uses computational, behavioral, and brain imaging methods to investigate how the visual system represents and processes information about human bodies. The studies will reveal how and when people can accurately recognize objects in natural images, how the brain supports this function, and how loss of information, similar to that that accompanies visual disease, may affect the ability to interpret everyday scenes.",Towards a Compositional Generative Model of Human Vision,10018020,R01EY029700,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Behavioral', 'Body Image', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confusion', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elbow', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'human model', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'theories', 'vision science']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,332870,0.06642361261949474
"Shared and specific mechanisms of auditory and visual category learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability to learn new perceptual categories enables some of the most complex human behaviors, from speech perception to visual object recognition. Current understanding of the mechanisms involved in perceptual category learning relies on the fundamental assumption that the processes underlying such learning are shared across the senses. However, the vast majority of this work has focused on the visual modality. As a consequence, the research regarding how humans learn to group complex auditory information into categories has relied greatly on conclusions from the research in the visual domain without testing this critical assumption. However, recent evidence from the attention literature suggests that even seemingly domain-general cognitive processes, such as working memory, are accomplished via sensory-biased regions in frontal cortex. The current investigation will directly compare the computational and neural mechanisms supporting auditory and visual category learning by training the same individuals on categories in both modalities while in an fMRI scanner. Aim #1 of this investigation will identify the shared and sensory-biased circuits supporting feedback processing during auditory and visual category learning. If the neural circuits supporting perceptual category learning are shared across the modalities, it is expected that similar regions will be recruited to a similar extent during feedback processing. If instead, the neural circuits are distinct for particular modalities, it is expected that sensory-biased regions will emerge as supporting category learning for auditory and visual modalities. Aim #2 will utilize advanced machine learning techniques (multivariate pattern classification and representational similarity analyses) to characterize the emergence of category-level neural representations over the course of learning. Aim #3 will identify the functional and structural connectivity of the circuits as they contribute to perceptual category learning. The proposed research will directly test the fundamental assumption about the nature of this complex problem that affects everyday behaviors. This research has the potential to impact understanding of cases where modality- specific learning abilities might be impaired, such as phonetic learning and language-related impairments in dyslexia, autism, and specific language impairment. The proposed research will provide the training foundation to support the PI’s long-term objective of developing theories of perceptual category learning that are constrained by neurobiology and behavior and will specify the behavioral, computational, and neural mechanisms of such learning. This project presents the opportunity to directly test a critical assumption underlying understanding of perceptual category learning. The proposed research will take place in an exceptional training environment and the PI will be mentored by a team of knowledgeable and accomplished scientists. The research will provide the PI with training in functional magnetic resonance experiment design and analysis which will prepare her well for a career as an independent scientist in computational cognitive neuroscience. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about how seemingly general-purpose cognitive systems may demonstrate modality specificity. The goal of this investigation is to characterize the differences in cognitive processing during category learning when the information comes from the auditory or visual modalities. The findings from this work may inform mechanistic approaches to understanding modality- specific deficits in language-based disorders, such as dyslexia, autism, and specific language impairment.",Shared and specific mechanisms of auditory and visual category learning,10064815,F32DC018979,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Environment', 'Esters', 'Feedback', 'Finches', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hobbies', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mentors', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'career', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'object recognition', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'theories', 'visual learning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2020,64554,0.04122748998211823
"Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex. Project Summary How is the representation of complex visual objects organized in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the large brain region responsible for object recognition? To date, areas selective for a few categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found, but the vast majority of IT cortex is “wild,” lacking any known specialization. Various schemes have been proposed for parceling IT, but a comprehensive understanding of IT organization remains elusive. Here, we propose to use fMRI, microstimulation, and electrophysiology to develop a unified understanding of the organization and coding principles of macaque IT. The experiments are motivated by a major advance in computer vision and two key preliminary results from our lab. First, the advent of deep networks trained for object classification makes it possible to generate a parametric object space, providing a quantitative framework to decipher the feature selectivity of single IT cells. Second, our preliminary results suggest that a large portion of macaque IT cortex is topographically organized according to the first two principal components of object space. This topography encompasses at least four distinct networks, each with at least three hierarchical nodes of increasing view invariance, and includes the previously described face and body patch networks. Furthermore, single cells within each network are projecting incoming objects, formatted as vectors in the object space, onto specific preferred axes. Taken together, these results suggest a new hypothesis for IT organization: IT cortex is tiled by networks (i.e., sets of functionally connected nodes, where a node is a patch of IT cells) whose organization and coding principles are very similar to that of the face patch network, and the layout of these networks follows a regular topography specified by the statistical structure of object space. We propose three Specific Aims to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will systematically map all networks within IT of individual animals. In Aim 2, we will record responses of cells in each identified network to a large, common set of object stimuli and determine their coding scheme. In Aim 3, we will perturb activity in each network and quantitatively assess effect on object recognition behavior. Together, these three Aims seek to build a comprehensive understanding of IT organization that bridges fMRI, single units, and behavior. Our lab has developed powerful experimental techniques to tackle each of these Aims and has previously applied them to the macaque face patch system. We believe the time is ripe to apply these techniques to the larger problem of how all objects are represented--not just faces. In the same way that Mendeleev’s arrangement of chemical elements according to their atomic mass and chemical properties helped elucidate the electronic structure of atoms, we believe systematic mapping and characterization of all networks in IT will help elucidate the fundamental neural mechanism for object recognition. Narrative This basic research application will investigate how visual objects are processed by the brain. The brain areas we will study are located in the temporal lobe, a brain region especially susceptible to neurological disease including Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy.

"Cortical computations underlying binocular motion integration PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Neuroscience is highly specialized—even visual submodalities such as motion, depth, form and color processing are often studied in isolation. One disadvantage of this isolation is that results from each subfield are not brought together to constrain common underlying neural circuitry. Yet, to understand the cortical computations that support vision, it is important to unify our fragmentary models that capture isolated insights across visual submodalities so that all relevant experimental and theoretical efforts can benefit from the most powerful and robust models that can be achieved. This proposal aims to take the first concrete step in that direction by unifying models of direction selectivity, binocular disparity selectivity and 3D motion selectivity (also known as motion-in-depth) to reveal circuits and understand computations from V1 to area MT. Motion in 3D inherently bridges visual submodalities, necessitating the integration of motion and binocular processing, and we are motivated by two recent paradigm-breaking physiological studies that have shown that area MT has a robust representation of 3D motion. In Aim 1, we will create the first unified model and understanding of the relationship between pattern and 3D motion in MT. In Aim 2, we will construct the first unified model of motion and disparity processing in MT. In Aim 3, we will develop a large-scale biologically plausible model of these selectivities that represents realistic response distributions across an MT population. Having a population output that is complete enough to represent widely-used visual stimuli will amplify our ability to link to population read-out theories and to link to results from psychophysical studies of visual perception. Key elements of our approach are (1) an iterative loop between modeling and electrophysiological experiments; (2) building a set of shared models, stimuli, data and analysis tools in a cloud-based system that unifies efforts across labs, creating opportunities for deep collaboration between labs that specialize in relevant submodalities, and encouraging all interested scientists to contribute and benefit; (3) using model-driven experiments to answer open, inter-related questions that involve motion and binocular processing, including motion opponency, spatial integration, binocular integration and the timely problem of how 3D motion is represented in area MT; (4) unifying insights from filter-based models and conceptual, i.e., non-image- computable, models to generate the first large-scale spiking hierarchical circuits that predict and explain how correlated signals and noise are transformed across multiple cortical stages to carry out essential visual computations; and (5) carrying out novel simultaneous recordings across visual areas. This research also has potential long-term benefits in medicine and technology. It will build fundamental knowledge about functional cortical circuitry that someday may be useful for interpreting dysfunctions of the cortex or for helping biomedical engineers construct devices to interface to the brain. Insights gained from the visual cortex may also help to advance computer vision technology. NARRATIVE The processing of visual motion and depth information is essential for a wide variety of important human abilities, including navigating through the world, avoiding collisions, catching and grabbing objects and interpreting complex scenes. To understand how neurons in the visual cortex transform and represent the information that underlies these abilities, we aim to initiate the development of a more complete, biologically constrained and openly available computer model of motion and depth processing that will be used to guide, and to interpret and incorporate results from, primate visual neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments. Gaining an understanding of the normal function of cortical neural circuitry is an important step in building the fundamental knowledge that someday may help to improve the ability to assess dysfunctions of the cortex and may help bioengineers create devices that interface to cortical circuitry to treat disorders and overcome disabilities.",Cortical computations underlying binocular motion integration,9969438,R01EY027023,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Production', 'Psychophysics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Vision Disparity', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Motion', 'Visual Perception', 'area MT', 'base', 'cloud based', 'color processing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fitness', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial integration', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual neuroscience', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,399500,0.0815794382837277
"Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes Summary/Abstract Real world scenes contain a wealth of information that guide where we look and help us search for things in our visual environment more efficiently. For example, if you were looking for a person in a city, you would look mostly on the sidewalk, whereas if you were looking for a car, you would concentrate your attention on the street. Despite the fact that behavioral experiments have increasingly quantified the role of object and scene knowledge in the guidance of attention and eye movements, models of these processes, particularly neural models, neglect the role of visual knowledge. The goal of this project is to determine whether regions of the brain shown to be important for object and scene recognition are involved in visual guidance in natural scenes. Prior results, including our preliminary data, show that the neural activity from object processing regions can be used to predict what object a person is going to look at next. However, critical questions that remain are: is this predictive activity influenced by scene and object knowledge and is it causally related to visual guidance? Answering these two questions are the specific goals of this proposal. Individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy provide the rare opportunity of recording directly from the human brain (intracranial electroencephalography, iEEG), which provides a superior spatial and temporal resolution measure of brain activity compared to other technique. These direct recordings also allow for electrical brain stimulation (EBS), which can provide causal evidence tying the activity in particular regions to cognitive function. Finally, these data will be supplemented by magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to examine whole brain effects in healthy individuals. iEEG and MEG data arising from regions involved in object and scene recognition will be analyzed by multivariate machine learning techniques to continually classify what subjects are viewing on a moment-to- moment basis. Furthermore, we will try to predict what object subjects will view next during free viewing and visual search in natural scenes based on their neural data. We will assess how these neural signals are modified by the presence or absence of information about typical locations of objects or people in the scene that have been shown to guide behavior. Finally, using EBS we will determine if there is a causal link between the activity in regions involved in coding for object and scene knowledge and visual guidance in natural scene vision. If successful, these studies would necessitate a substantial reshaping of models of visual attention in the human brain. The results could form the foundation of a program of research into the neural basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world. Attention, perception, and eye movement abnormalities are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Thus, these studies, and the models that arise from them, have the translational potential to advance our understanding of the neurological basis of these disorders and suggest potential neurally inspired rehabilitation strategies. Narrative Abnormalities in visual attention and eye movement guidance are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including visual agnosia, neglect, schizophrenia, autism, etc. The neural basis of visual attention and eye movement guidance in the real world is unknown; therefore it remains unknown how neural abnormalities in these disorders relate to real world visual deficits, which is a critical barrier to designing hypothesis-driven remediation strategies. The proposed research will take critical early steps towards understanding the neural basis of real world attention and eye movement control, which has the potential to transform our understanding of these critical visual processes. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of eye movement and attentional guidance, a circuit relevant to a number of disorders, and take a critical step towards developing hypotheses for remediation strategies.",Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes,10004653,R21EY030297,"['Agnosia', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologic', 'Object Attachment', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Agnosias', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Walking', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'computer monitor', 'design', 'experimental study', 'neglect', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neurotransmission', 'programs', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'spatial relationship', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual search', 'visual tracking']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2020,195625,0.0795621560832511
"Environmental Localization Mapping and Guidance for Visual Prosthesis Users Project Summary About 1.3 million Americans aged 40 and older are legally blind, a majority because of diseases with onset later in life, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Second Sight has developed the world's first FDA approved retinal implant, Argus II, intended to restore some functional vision for people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In this era of smart devices, generic navigation technology, such as GPS mapping apps for smartphones, can provide directions to help guide a blind user from point A to point B. However, these navigational aids do little to enable blind users to form an egocentric understanding of the surroundings, are not suited to navigation indoors, and do nothing to assist in avoiding obstacles to mobility. The Argus II, on the other hand, provides blind users with a limited visual representation of their surroundings that improves users' ability to orient themselves and traverse obstacles, yet lacks features for high-level navigation and semantic interpretation of the surroundings. The proposed research aims to address these limitations of the Argus II through a synergy of state-of-the-art stimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object recognition technologies. For the past three years, JHU/APL has collaborated with Second Sight to develop similar advanced vision-based capabilities for the Argus II, including capabilities for object recognition and obstacle detection by stereo vision. This proposal is driven by the hypothesis that navigation for users of retinal prosthetics can be greatly improved by incorporating SLAM and object recognition technology conveying environmental information via a retinal prosthesis and auditory feedback. SLAM enables the visual prosthesis system to construct a map of the user's environment and locate the user within that map. The system then provides object location and navigational cues via appropriate sensory modalities enabling the user to mentally form an egocentric map of the environment. We propose to develop and test a visual prosthesis system which 1) constructs a map of unfamiliar environments and localizes the user using SLAM technology 2) automatically identifies navigationally-relevant objects and landmarks using object recognition and 3) provides sensory feedback for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and object/landmark identification.

"Elucidating novel features of visual processing and physiological connectivity from retina to primary visual cortex Project Summary The use of stimuli with increasingly naturalistic properties has become critical to advance our understanding of vision. Many studies demonstrate that simple artificial stimuli (e.g. sinusoidal gratings and white noise) fail to engage nonlinearities that profoundly alter responses in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and primary visual cortex (V1). A recent and striking example comes from the use of naturalistic ‘flow’ stimuli, which engage robust responses in V1 that are not predicted from responses to gratings. This gap in understanding motivates the development of a stimulus ensemble and analysis framework that produces a quantitative understanding of visual processing to increasingly naturalistic stimuli and the nonlinearities that they engage. Our objective is to understand how flow stimuli are processed from retina through visual cortex. To meet this goal, we will make neural population recordings in retina (Aims 1 & 3), LGN (Aims 1 & 3) and V1 (Aim 3) using matched experimental conditions and a unified theoretical/modeling framework to map the transformations that occur across these stages of visual processing. Our central hypothesis is that V1 transforms a discrete and heavily light-level-de- pendent retinal representation of natural stimuli into a continuous (uniform) representation that is relatively in- variant to changes in the mean luminance. This invariance places a strong constraint on the class of nonlineari- ties that transform retinal responses to those observed in LGN and V1. We test this hypothesis in three aims: (1) determine early visual processing (retina & LGN) of naturalistic flow stimuli; (2) develop an encoding manifold to capture the population activity at each processing stage and transforms from one stage to the next; (3) test the ability of the manifold description to predict the impact of light adaptation on processing flow stimuli from retina to V1. Aim 1 will yield a matched experimental dataset to an interesting and novel class of ecologically-relevant stimuli. Aim 2 will yield a quantitative framework by which to understand the transformations that occur between retina, LGN, and V1. Aim 3 will provide a platform for globally perturbing the output of the retina by switching from photopic to mesopic and scotopic conditions, and thereby compare predictions of our model to measured changes in LGN and V1 activity. The primary significance of this research is that it will provide a computationally and experimentally unified framework for understanding the transformations that occur in the processing of stim- uli across multiple stages of visual processing. The major innovations are (1) presenting visual stimuli for retinal recordings that are matched to eye movements and pupil dynamics in alert animals; (2) creating a novel analysis framework that captures the responses of neurons at all three levels and the inter-level transformations to in- creasingly complex stimuli; (3) utilizing light adaptation as a method of perturbing retinal output to test our model and the stability (invariance) of LGN and V1 responses to adapting retinal signals. The expected outcome is a data-driven model of the processing from retina to LGN and V1 that generalizes from starlight to sunlight. Project Narrative Restoring vision to the blind likely requires understanding how retinal signals are communicated to the brain and how these signals are transformed in the thalamocortical pathway.

"CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian PROJECT DESCRIPTION  Collaborating Pis and Consultant  United States  Pl: Anitha Pasupathy, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA  Co-Pl: Wyeth Bair, Dept. of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, USA Japan  Pl: lsamu Motoyoshi, Dept. of Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan  Consultant: Hidehiko Komatsu, Tamagawa University, Japan  Specific Aims  Our visual system endows us with a diverse set of abilities: to recognize and manipulate  objects, avoid obstacles and danger during navigation, evaluate the quality of food, read text,  interpret facial expressions, etc. This relies on the neuronal processing of information about  form and material texture along the ventral pathway of the primate visual system (Ungerleider &  Mishkin, 1982; Felleman & Van Essen, 1991). Studies over the past several decades have  produced detailed models of how visual information is processed in V1, the earliest stage along . this pathway (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1968; Movshon et al., 1978a, b; Albrecht et al., 1980), but  beyond V1 our understanding of visual processing and representation is limited. This is  particularly true with regard to our understanding of how visual representations of form and  texture jointly contribute to object perception and recognition. The broad goal of this proposal is  two-fold-to develop an experimentally-driven image-computable model for how naturalistic  visual stimuli are processed in area V4, an important intermediate stage along the ventral visual  pathway (Aim 1) and to discover how such a representation contributes to perception (Aim 2).  Past studies have shown that V4 neurons are sensitive to both the form (Desimone and Schein,  1987; Kobatake and Tanaka, 1994; Gallant et al., 1993; Pasupathy and Connor, 2001; Nandy et  al., 2013) and the surface texture of visual stimuli (Arcizet et al., 2008; Goda et al., 2014;  Okazawa et al., 2015). But, because expertise is narrow and experimental time limited,  scientists tend to focus exclusively on the encoding of form or texture and not on their joint  coding. For example, in the laboratories of the USA portion of this collaboration, we have until  now focused on form processing by carrying out neurophysiological studies using 2D shapes  with uniform surface properties to investigate how object boundaries are encoded (Oleskiw et  al., 2014; Popovkina et al., 2016). We have modeled our data by comparing the representation  of V4 neurons to that of the units in AlexNet (Pospisil et al., 2015), a prominent convolutional  neural net (CNN) trained to recognize objects (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). At the same time, the  Japanese contingent of this collaboration has investigated the encoding of surface texture and  gloss in human perception without associated form encoding (Motoyoshi et al., 2007; Sharan et  al., 2008; Motoyoshi, 2010; Motoyoshi & Matoba, 2012). Here we propose to bring our  respective expertise in studying form and texture encoding to bear on the question of how  naturalistic stimuli with both form and surface cues are encoded in area V4 and how these  representations support human visual perception. Our specific aims are:  Aim1. To build a unified image-computable model for neuronal responses to shapes and  textures in area V4  V4 responses to 2D shapes with uniform luminance/chromatic characteristics can be explained  by a hierarchical-Max (HMax) model for object recognition that emphasizes boundary features  (Cadieu et al., 2007). Such responses can also be explained by units in artificial deep  convolutional networks, in which boundary features are not explicitly emphasized (all features  are learned from initially random weights). On the other hand, V4 responses to texture patches  can be well explained by a higher-order image-statistics-based model (Okazawa et al., 2015).  Using shape data from the Pasupathy lab and texture data from the Komatsu lab (Japanese  consultant), we will ask whether responses of V4 neurons to shapes and textures can be Page 21 n/a",CRCNS: Joint coding of shape and texture in the primate brian,9994299,R01EY029997,"['3-Dimensional', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Facial Expression', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Japan', 'Japanese Population', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Surface Properties', 'Text', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tokyo', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'V4 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'area V4', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'experimental study', 'food quality', 'human model', 'human subject', 'information processing', 'luminance', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'response', 'statistics', 'visual information', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,230475,0.12230596452170125
"GAZE AND THE VISUAL CONTROL OF FOOT PLACEMENT WHEN WALKING OVER ROUGH TERRAIN PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT  Human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy, from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture. However, despite the complex neural bases of human locomotion, the output is highly regular and well organized around the basic physical dynamics and biomechanics that define the stability and energetic costs of moving a bipedal body through space. There is a rich and growing body of literature describing detailed knowledge each of the individual components of human locomotion, including neural mechanisms, muscular neuromechanics, and biomechanics. However, very little research exists on the way that visual input is used to dynamically control locomotion, and the overall control structure of the integrated neural and mechanical system during natural locomotion through a complex and dynamic world. This lack of integrative research not only restricts the breadth of impact of research from these individual disciplines, but also limits our ability to develop adequate treatment plans for loss of locomotor ability deriving from systems-level factors such as aging, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. In order to to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about human locomotion, it is necessary to develop an integrated research program that examines the interactions between the visual, neural, and mechanical bases of human movement through the world. In service of this general goal, this proposal outlines research projects aimed at specific unanswered questions about locomotion over different terrains. This proposal comprises three specific research and training aims on the visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. Aim 1 focuses on the behavioral task itself, Aim 2 investigates the sensory stimulus experienced during real-world locomotion, and Aim 3 examines the motor integration of visually specified goals into the ongoing gait cycle. Aim 1 investigates effects of changing environmental uncertainty and task demands on gaze allocation strategies during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 2 analyzes and models the visual stimulus experienced during locomotion over real-world rough terrain. Aim 3 determines how visually specified target footholds and targets are integrated into the ongoing preferred steady-state gait. Together these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how humans use vision to control their movement through the natural world, which greatly increase our ability to develop clinical diagnosis and treatment for loss of locomotor function.

"Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing Project Summary The goal of this project is to test a novel theoretical framework for understanding how the ventral pathway subserves object vision. In the standard framework, a series of neural operations on 2D image data through many intermediate cortical stages, including area V4, leads to high-level perceptual representations, including representation of object identity, at the final stages of the ventral pathway. However, our preliminary microelectrode data from a fixating monkey show that many neurons in V4 represent volumetric (volume- enclosing) 3D shape, not 2D image patterns. These neurons respond to many different 2D images that convey the same 3D shape with different shape-in-depth cues, including shading, reflection, and refraction. They even respond preferentially to random dot stereograms that convey 3D volumetric shape with no 2D cues whatsoever. Moreover, our preliminary results with 2-photon functional imaging in anesthetized monkey V4 show that 3D shape signals are grouped by their similarity, and also group with isomorphic (same outline) 2D shape signals (which could contribute evidence to corresponding 3D shape inferences). We propose to capitalize on these preliminary data by demonstrating the prevalence of 3D shape tuning in area V4, analyzing the 3D shape coding strategies used by these neurons, and measuring how 2D and 3D shape signals are arranged at a microscopic level across the surface of V4. We expect these results to provide strong evidence that extraction of 3D shape fragments is a primary goal of V4 processing. This early extraction of 3D shape information, just two synapses beyond primary visual cortex, would suggest a competing framework for understanding the ventral pathway, in which the initial goal is to represent 3D physical structure, independent of the various 2D image cues used to infer it. In this framework, object recognition would be based on preceding information about 3D physical structure, which would explain why human object recognition is so robust to image changes, in a way that the best computational vision systems are not. The scientific impact of this work would be to divert vision experiments toward understanding representation of real world 3D structure (rather than 2D planar stimuli) and to encourage computational vision scientists to incorporate early 3D shape processing into the deep convolutional network models that are the current state of the art. Narrative This study will help explain how the human brain achieves such remarkably robust perception of visual objects. The results will help guide future rehabilitative and prosthetic strategies for patients with visual impairments, by elucidating neural strategies that could be used to bring computer vision prosthetics up to human performance levels, and by discovering specific neural signals for object information that could be replicated by electrode array implants in higher-level visual cortex.",Early representation of 3D volumetric shape in visual object processing,9942414,R01EY029420,"['3-Dimensional', '3D world', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Electrodes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Microelectrodes', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Ocular Prosthesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prosthesis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual impairment', 'Work', 'area V4', 'area striata', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'experimental study', 'individual response', 'network models', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'three dimensional structure', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality', 'visual object processing']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,548567,0.07671382646555973
"Development of a visual-to-tactile conversion system for automating tactile graphic generation process PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are an estimated 23.7 million people who are blind or visually-impaired (BVI) in the U.S. and 285 million globally. Of this population, 30% do not travel independently outside of their home, only ~11% have a bachelor’s degree, and more than 70% are unemployed. The goal of this SBIR effort is to develop a novel system, which performs principled down-sampling and translation of visual information from digital documents into tactile equivalents. Timely access to information is one of the biggest challenges for BVI people. While access to textual information has largely been solved via screen reading software (e.g., JAWS or VoiceOver), very little progress has been made in making graphical information accessible. Although few assistive technology (AT) devices aim provide non-visual graphical access, they suffer from several shortcomings including high cost, limited portability, lack of multi-purpose, and inability to present information in a real-time context. Importantly, a common underlying problem across all extant approaches is that they require intensive human effort for producing or authoring tactile (and/or multimodal) graphics, which leads to high production costs and significant delays in the time between when the accessible materials are needed, and when they are actually delivered, adversely impacting BVI individuals in K-12 schools, colleges, and workplace settings. To address this long-standing problem, UNAR Labs aims to develop a novel system, which will automatically down-sample and translate visual graphical information into an intuitive tactile equivalent that can be used in tactile embossers. Building upon eight years of empirical research, this Phase I SBIR effort will prove the technical feasibility and functional viability of a prototype system for automating visual-to-tactile graphic conversion process and using the output in embossers. Two specific aims will guide this Phase I project: (1) to develop a prototype of an automated system for performing visual-to-tactile conversion without human intervention, and (2) to assess the technical feasibility and functional utility of the system through a rigorous human study. Success in this effort will provide a robust automated system for tactile graphic generation and promote empowerment of millions of BVI individuals by supporting increased educational attainment, proliferation of vocational opportunities, and enhancing overall quality of life for BVI people. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lack of equitable and timely access to information among persons who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) is key to realizing an inclusive world for all as it alleviates a known impediment that is hugely detrimental to their success in activities affecting quality of life and socio-economic status. The proposed innovation presents a first- of-its kind on-demand visual-to-tactile translation system, which will fully automate the tactile graphic generation process using bio-inspired sensory substitution rules and will instantly deliver the translated information for use in tactile embossers. Successful completion of this project will significantly reduce tactile graphic production costs and preparation time, and will promote empowerment of millions of BVI individuals by supporting increased educational attainment, vocational opportunities, and overall better quality of life.",Development of a visual-to-tactile conversion system for automating tactile graphic generation process,10008494,R43EY031628,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Benchmarking', 'Braille Display', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Empirical Research', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Maine', 'Maps', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality of life', 'Readability', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Software Framework', 'Support System', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Unemployment', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'college', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'empowerment', 'human study', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'novel', 'operation', 'portability', 'prototype', 'success', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'visual information', 'visual learning']",NEI,"UNAR LABS, LLC",R43,2020,300000,0.02885974898285069
"Access to parietal action representations after stroke lesions in visual cortex PROJECT SUMMARY  The ability to recognize and use objects according to their function (e.g., fork, hammer, pencil) requires integration of visual, semantic and action knowledge across occipital, temporal and parietal areas. Left parietal regions support critical aspects of object-directed action, such as grasping and object manipulation. This research activity uses a combination of fMRI and behavioral measures in patients with ischemic strokes to early and extrastriate visual areas to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1: There is a visual pathway to the parietal grasp region (aIPS) that bypasses processing in primary visual cortex. Aim 2: Left ventral extrastriate cortex is necessary to access manipulation information for visually presented objects. Aim 3A: Ballistic grasping actions to objects in the hemianopic field are influenced by volumetric properties (size, orientation) of targets. Aim 3B: Left ventral extrastriate lesions impair object function (e.g., `scissors used to cut') and disrupt access to manipulation knowledge from visual input. The research leverages strengths of fMRI (whole brain correlational measure) and neuropsychology (causal inference) to test new hypotheses about vision and action.  `Tools' (i.e., small manipulable objects) are an excellent domain in which to address broader questions about the integration of sensory, motor and cognitive processing. This is because tool recognition and tool use require the integration of distinct sensory, motor and cognitive representations, and the neural substrates of tool processing are well described. The research program emphasizes fresh perspectives on longstanding ideas about the dorsal and ventral visual pathways, by a) undertaking the first systematic investigation of the types of information about objects that are extracted by visual pathways that bypass primary visual cortex, and by b) studying how some parietal areas depend on inputs from the ventral stream in order to access the correct action for a given object. The research activity innovates by testing hypotheses about how lesions at different stages in the cortical visual hierarchy affect downstream processing in parietal cortex, combining neural and behavioral measures to study brain damaged patients (generating causal evidence), and by combining univariate and multivariate measures to `read out' the information content of brain regions (parietal cortex) that are anatomically remote from a lesion. The research advances understanding of how lesions in one brain region disrupt computations in other parts of the brain that depend on the damaged region for their inputs, a phenomenon (`dynamic diaschisis') that applies to brain injury generally. Advancing understanding of these basic issues using causal data has broad implications for understanding how the brain selects the correct action for the correct object, and more generally for theories of conceptual organization and causal reasoning. Understanding how the brain accesses actions from visual input has implications for related fields, such as robotics, neuroprosthetics, and evidenced based approaches for rehabilitating function after brain injury. Project Narrative Functional MRI and behavioral testing are used to test hypotheses about how strokes affecting occipital and temporal cortex disrupt access to action representations in parietal cortex. This research will advance understanding of how the brain processes visual information in support of everyday actions.",Access to parietal action representations after stroke lesions in visual cortex,9868307,R01EY028535,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alexia', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Ballistics', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Bypass', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Eating', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Imaging Device', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neuropsychology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'blind', 'cognitive development', 'evidence base', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'grasp', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'multisensory', 'neuroprosthesis', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual motor', 'visual object processing', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,423007,0.12717562887809458
"Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex ABSTRACT  Our long-term goal is to understand how the human brain recognizes objects. This 3-year project will characterize the computational kernel (computation that is applied independently to many parts of the image data) that is isolated by crowding experiments. We present the discovery that recognition of simple objects is performed by recognition units implementing the same computation at every eccentricity. These units are dense in the fovea and thus hard to isolate there, but they are sparse in the periphery, and easily isolated. Our fMRI & psychophysics pilot data show that each of these units, at every eccentricity, has a circular receptive field with a radius of 2.6±1.5 mm (mean±SD) in human cortical area hV4. Because of cortical magnification, that 2.6 mm corresponds to a tiny 0.05 deg in the fovea, but grows linearly with eccentricity, to a comfortable 3 deg at 10 deg eccentricity. We test this idea by pursuing its implications physiologically (Aim 1), clinically (Aim 2), and psychophysically and computationally (Aim 3).  Aim 1. Better noninvasive measures for the health and development of visual cortex are needed. Conservation of crowding distance (in mm) in a particular cortical area (hV4) would validate crowding distance as a quick, noninvasive measure of that area's condition. Aim 2. Huge public interventions seek to help dyslexic children read faster and identify amblyopic children sooner. It would be valuable to know whether crowding contributes to reading problems and provides a basis for effective screening for dyslexia and amblyopia, as it can be measured before children learn to read. Aim 3. Documenting conservation of efficiency gives evidence that the same universal computation recognizes objects at every eccentricity. We are testing the first computational model of object recognition that accounts for many human characteristics of simple-object recognition. The new work extends to effect of receptive field size and learning. Project Narrative (relevance to public health) This proposal is a collaboration between a psychophysicist, expert on human object recognition, a computer scientist, expert on machine learning for object recognition by computers, and a brain imager, expert on brain mapping, to discover to what extent computer models of object recognition and the brain can account for key properties of human performance. Our first aim tracks the development of crowding in normal and amblyopic children, in collaboration with experts in optometry, reading, and development. Advances in this area could shed light on the problems of people with impaired object recognition, including amblyopia and dyslexia, with a potential for development of early pre-literate screening tests for amblyopia and risk of dyslexia.",Studying crowding as a window into object recognition and development and health of visual cortex,9884770,R01EY027964,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amblyopia', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Bypass', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nose', 'Occipital lobe', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Reading', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rome', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'assault', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fovea centralis', 'imager', 'literate', 'object recognition', 'physiologic model', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'vision development']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,388626,0.09101791112727176
