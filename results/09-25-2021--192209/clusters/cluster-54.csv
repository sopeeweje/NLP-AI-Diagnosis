"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions. We will generate genome-wide temporal profiles of chromatin state and gene expression during nuclear reprogramming, learn integrative models of dynamic gene regulation and perform experiments to validate biological hypotheses generated by the model.",Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming,9722284,R01HG009674,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Fate Control', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell fusion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Pattern', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'RNA Interference', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'heterokaryon', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'nuclear reprogramming', 'pluripotency', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,703311,0.07144461768711868
"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,9896942,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,362352,0.05525812774652037
"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation. Recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques has allowed us to look beyond the nucleotide sequence of DNA and investigate the principles of higher-order chromatin organization. I will develop innovative computational and statistical strategies to investigate 3D genome organization at an unprecedented scale, thereby elucidating the impacts of genome organization on gene regulation and disease.",Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation,9798957,R35GM133678,"['3-Dimensional', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complement 3d', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome Stability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Play', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'deep sequencing', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'spatiotemporal']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R35,2019,369984,0.009542261424564541
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9753292,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'learning network', 'men', 'next generation sequence data', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,468156,0.005409906573659042
"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution. Ultimately, without an understanding of the adaptive potential of translation we have an incomplete, and imperfect, picture of the underlying genetic causes of numerous forms of cancer and genetic diseases.",The adaptive potential of translational regulation,9683394,F32GM131573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Pathology', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Nutrient', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathology', 'Performance at work', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translation Initiation', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'analytical tool', 'cancer genetics', 'collaborative environment', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'preservation', 'promoter', 'response', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61226,0.0019977299550457666
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,9699752,R35GM131845,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth', 'Hermaphroditism', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'autosome', 'chromatin modification', 'condensin', 'dosage', 'histone demethylase', 'male', 'man', 'neural network', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'sex', 'sex determination', 'single molecule', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2019,466290,0.055146622588898034
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.

Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects.

Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",9623355,R01HG009906,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Imagery', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,284020,0.03376458516163095
"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",9801992,R01GM134056,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Complement', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Homeostasis', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Model', 'Plants', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Toxin', 'Transgenes', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biophysical properties', 'bisulfite', 'density', 'epigenetic memory', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'trait', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2019,319720,0.045040198212432395
"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9656869,F31CA221061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tweens', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2019,39107,0.03016825986101541
"New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Cellular state transitions (i.e. from pluripotent to committed, replicative to quiescent, etc.) require the  coordinated regulation of thousands of genes. Therapeutically harnessing these transitions holds great  promise for human health;; for instance, autologous stem cell therapy has been successfully used in  regenerative medicine and cancer treatments, among others. While some of the key regulatory switches are  known, the field lacks a systems-­level understanding of the genomic circuits that control these transitions,  information that is critical for informed clinical intervention. Here, we will develop an integrated computational  framework to identify core gene regulatory circuits from large gene networks and predict their dynamics and  regulatory functions without the need of detailed network kinetic parameters. Advances in genomics profiling  technology have enabled the mapping of gene regulatory networks, thus we now have the capacity to identify  combinatorial interactions among genes and the master regulators of state transitions. Some systems biology  approaches have simulated the dynamics of a gene regulatory circuit, but traditional methods suffer from two  key issues. First, there is no rational rule to choose an appropriate set of regulator genes in a large network to  model. Second, since it is hard to directly measure most network kinetic parameters from experiment,  modeling results are based on a set of guessed parameters that can be less than optimal, limiting the  application of mathematical modeling to large systems and the prediction power of systems biology. To  address these issues, we recently developed algorithm named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE). RACIPE  generates an ensemble of circuit models, each of which corresponds to a distinct set of random kinetic  parameters, and uniquely identifies robust features, such as clusters of stable gene expression states, by  statistical analysis. We will further enhance RACIPE algorithms for large systems and new data analysis tools  using machine learning. This approach will convert a traditional nonlinear dynamics problem into a data  analysis problem, an essential step for extending the application of gene circuit modeling to large systems. It  also provides a novel strategy to integrate top-­down genomics approaches with bottom-­up mathematical  modeling. The algorithms will be tested and refined using literature-­based gene networks, public genomics  data, and data from collaboration, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state  transitions in oncogenesis. Success of the project will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene  regulatory mechanism of cellular decision-­making in any cell of interest. The algorithmic development is   expected to have a broad impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on  therapeutic intervention in genomic medicine.      RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Most human complex diseases are multigenic, but our understanding of the interactions between genes in  healthy states and how they are disrupted in disease states is lacking. Computational algorithms will be  designed to construct and model gene regulatory circuits of higher complexity to fill an important gap in our  understanding of the maintenance and transitions among cellular states and their abnormal behavior in  disease. In this proposal, we will develop a suite of systems-­biology tools to extend gene circuit modeling to  large systems and integrate genomics data relevant to fundamental cell biology, cancer, and other human  diseases.   ",New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits,9752643,R35GM128717,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autologous', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Public Health', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'novel strategies', 'stem cell therapy', 'success', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,437500,0.03218848945748445
"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",9699641,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic agent', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Embryonic Development', 'Estrogens', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'biophysical model', 'gene interaction', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neurogenomics', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'social', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2019,356979,0.014668741993699991
"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF. I propose to develop a tool to find all the transcription factors in the human genome that can turn ON target genes.",HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS,9646957,K99GM131022,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glutamine', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase Transition', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reading', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Yeasts', 'activating transcription factor', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging platform', 'in vivo', 'model building', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'rapid technique', 'recruit', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2019,99998,0.011567796818996978
"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state. Here we propose to develop computational tools to define how one type of epigenetic modification, called hydroxymethylation, impacts gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. These tools will be versatile and adaptable to any cell type of choice, enabling research into the molecular features of the genome that underlie both normal and pathological cell behaviors.",An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation,9798459,R35GM133562,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'B cell differentiation', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'differentiated B cell', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'next generation sequencing', 'prevent', 'programs', 'stem cell differentiation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,472500,0.03294242239077037
"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9751340,R35GM128938,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distal', 'Experimental Designs', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graph theory', 'histone modification', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'statistics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2019,449829,0.024789205521563183
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9774175,R01GM120167,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,520253,-0.0009927748016314859
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research. This next cycle of funding will expand the definition of gene expression across the immune system, analyze how its regulatory hierarchy relates to immune responses.

"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9746755,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,400001,0.009156137012959972
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs.

"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals. Dr. Jesse Gillis, expert in transcriptome meta-analysis, and Dr. Josh Huang, expert in GABAergic interneuron identity, will be my mentors. Dr. Bing Ren, Dr. Adam Siepel, Dr. Guoping Feng, Dr. Jessica Tollkuhn and Dr. Michael Greenberg will be collaborators and members of my advisory committee, ensuring that my research will be of the highest caliber. My training will also involve coursework in multiomics data integration and comparative genomics, and I will continue my professional development by presenting at international conferences, mentoring students and attending workshops at CSHL. Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear.

"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills.

"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9706661,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2019,480000,0.026194075749691653
"UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The simplest conceptual model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. In this “independent action model”, if the TF has an activation domain, it activates the genes whose promoters it binds; if it has a repression domain, it represses the genes whose promoters it binds. It is remarkable then, that in existing, comprehensive data sets, that the vast majority of genes whose promoters are bound by a TF show no change in expression when the TF is knocked down or knocked out. In yeast data where all TFs have been analyzed, only 3-5% of bound genes respond when the TF is knocked out; in more recent, but less comprehensive human data it is rarely more than 15%. Furthermore, nearly every TF appears to activate some of the genes it binds while repressing others. These data show that we do not have a credible rough draft map of the regulatory logic of any eukaryote, as most of the genes bound by a TF in existing data are not regulated by that TF and we do not know how to predict which ones are. Our preliminary results show that some, but clearly not all, of the problem can be explained by technical issues inherent to the existing datasets. We there propose to generate new, comprehensive data sets that are ideally suited to studying the relationship between binding and functional regulation (Aim 1). We will use these datasets to quantify the predictive power of the independent action model. In Aim 2, we will collect genome- wide data focused understanding the interactions between TF binding and local chromatin state to see we can use the information to extend the independent action model to increase its predictive power. Finally, we will collect genome-wide data to identify TF-TF interactions that affect the gene expression response to perturbation. We will assess the predictive power of this information using computational models. This project will produce the first consistent data set that is well suited to studying the relationship between TF binding and regulation as well as the first credible overview of regulatory logic for any eukaryote. At the conclusion, we will know why perturbation of a TF apparently activates some of the genes it binds, represses other genes it binds, and does nothing at all to most of the genes it binds. Is it just the limitations of existing high-throughput data sets, or do interactions dominate independent action? What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The textbook model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. But the reality is that existing, large genomic data sets do not support this model. The proposed project will generate new genomic data sets to directly address this problem, and will investigate to what extent TF-chromatin and TF-TF interactions affect the relationship between TF binding and gene expression.",UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION,9789336,R01GM129126,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Eukaryota', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histones', 'Knock-out', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Repression', 'Resources', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ursidae Family', 'Writing', 'Yeasts', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'knock-down', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'response', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314166,0.004732259762885521
"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,9762140,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,513500,0.013340202435537067
"From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how the genome functions is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Encoded within its DNA sequences are the blueprints for several cell types. Nevertheless, it remains a mystery how the full variety of phenotypes arise, and how they are maintained. It is becoming increasingly clear that the epigenome— covalent modifications to the DNA and histone proteins—plays a crucial role. Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic modifications has clarified cell type specificity and the presence of a diverse set of combinatorial patterns that are strongly correlated with gene expression levels. Inferring causal relationships from these data has proved challenging, however. A working knowledge of the mechanisms that inform the establishment and regulation of the epigenome, and its impact on gene expression and cellular phenotype, therefore, remain elusive. In this project, we propose several novel modeling approaches which will address the key gaps in our understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and genome. First, we will parameterize a coarse- grained chromatin model from the bottom-up using a novel deep learning algorithm to generate an accurate and comprehensive characterization of chromatin secondary structure, and its sensitivity to DNA sequence, nucleosome repeat length, ionic concentrations, post-translational modifications, and phase-separated liquid- droplets formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. High resolution chromatin structures from this effort will elucidate how different epigenetic modifications impact gene expression by regulating nucleosome packaging and DNA accessibility. Second, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating long-range interactions between regulatory elements by developing a predictive model which will enable de novo reconstruction of three-dimensional genome organization. This project will result in a global view of the role of the epigenome in cell differentiation and cell fate determination. An improved understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and the genome from this research program can guide the development of engineering approaches to modify the epigenome for both long lasting and reversible changes as a novel strategy for combating diseases such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The epigenome works hand-in-hand with the genome to encode cell phenotypic diversity for multicellular organisms. We will apply interdisciplinary approaches to disentangle the interrelationship between the two, thus elucidating the role of the genome in establishing and maintaining a robust epigenome, and providing mechanistic insight into epigenetic regulations of the genome’s function. Insights from our study will pave the way for rational epigenome engineering which holds great potential for transforming medicine and biotechnology.",From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization,9798562,R35GM133580,"['Address', 'Back', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Chromatin Structure', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Grain', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combat', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2019,377555,0.047649129693105786
"Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution Abstract The nematode C. elegans is unique among model organisms in having a defined lineage and known connections for all its 302 neurons. The genome sequence was completed more than 20 years ago, but knowing which genes in the genome are used in exactly which cells and what transcription factors are controlling that expression remains a major challenge. We have successfully applied single cell- (sc-)RNA-seq methods to one larval stage and three embryonic stages to measure the RNA content of individual cells across the whole animal. We also have preliminary data that indicates that we can assay chromatin accessibility at the single cell level using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We now propose to collect both sc-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data at multiple stages to determine the gene expression patterns of each cell in the worm and the active regulatory sequence throughout the entire life cycle of C. elegans. In turn we will use the combined data sets along with chromatin- immunoprecipitation- (ChIP-) seq data to impute what transcription factors are controlling expression of each gene in the genome in every cell and what regulatory sequences these transcription factors recognize. The results will provide a valuable resource to scientists studying the worm and addresses a major outstanding question in the molecular biology of development. In addition, these data sets, from an animal with a “ground truth” should serve as a platform for methods development in the single cell field. Narrative The nematode C. elegans is a simple animal that as an adult has just 959 somatic cells that arise from a known and constant lineage. We propose to use single cell methods to measure in every cell the expression of each gene and the active regulatory regions throughout the life cycle. Using these data and others, we will impute how these regulatory regions and the transcription factors that bind to them control gene expression in each cell.",Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution,9711034,R01HG010478,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dissociation', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Larva', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Tissues', 'Transposase', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'cost effectiveness', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'male', 'method development', 'muscular system', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcription factor', 'young adult']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,510309,0.006382235304897395
"Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases Project Summary/Abstract Many diseases are understudied because they are rare or of little public interest. The effect of each understudied disease may be limited, but the cumulative effects of all these diseases could be profound. One common research challenge for these diseases is that the resources allocated to each is often limited. For instance, large- scale screening of drugs is often challenging, if not possible, in small labs. The decreasing costs of next generation sequencing make possible the generation of gene expression profiles of understudied disease samples. Integrating these expression profiles with other open data provides tremendous opportunities to gain insights into disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutics for understudied diseases. We have utilized a systems-based approach that employs gene expression profiles of disease samples and drug-induced gene expression profiles from cancer cell lines to predict new therapeutic candidates for hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma and basal cell carcinoma. All these candidates were successfully validated in preclinical models. The success of this approach relies on multiscale procedures, such as quality control of disease samples, selection of appropriate reference tissues, evaluation of disease signatures, and weighting cell lines. There is a plethora of relevant datasets and analysis modules that are publicly available, yet are isolated in distinct silos, making it tedious to implement this approach in translational research. A centralized informatics system that allows prediction of therapeutics for further experimental validation is thus of great interest to researchers working on understudied diseases. Accordingly, we propose four specific aims: 1) developing novel deep learning methods to select precise reference normal tissues for disease signature creation, 2) developing computational methods to reuse drug profiles from other disease models for drug prediction, 3) integrating open efficacy data to identify new targets from the systems-based approach, and 4) developing a centralized platform and promoting the platform in the scientific community. This proposal will reuse several big open databases (e.g., TCGA, TARGET, GTEx, GEO, LINCS, CTRP, GDSC) and employ cutting-edge informatics methods (e.g., deep learning). To demonstrate the scalability of the system, we will investigate three representative understudied diseases: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Aim 1), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (Aim 2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Aim 3). Successful implementation of the systems-based approach can be used as a model for using other large open omics (proteins, metabolites) to discover therapeutics for diseases with unmet needs. This proposal will bring together experts in informatics, statistics, computer science, and physicians from Michigan State University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Spectrum Health. All data and code will be released to the public for continuing development. The system will be deployed to our OCTAD portal (http://octad.org), an open workplace for therapeutic discovery. Project Narrative About 25 million people are living with understudied diseases in the U.S. Although there are voluminous high dimensional molecular datasets that could be leveraged for research, individual labs have limited computational capacity to translate these molecular features into therapeutic hits. We propose to build a centralized information system that allows individual labs to easily harness open gene expression datasets and generate new therapeutic targets or drug candidates for further experimental validation.",Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases,9802075,R01GM134307,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Asia', 'Basal Cell', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Cancer cell line', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evaluation', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Ramp', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'System', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cancer gene expression', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'disorder control', 'drug candidate', 'drug mechanism', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'overexpression', 'pill', 'protein metabolite', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,453660,0.02508205056541801
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms.

"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression.

"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,9786812,R01HG010045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'markov model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,352626,0.03840152318230345
"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9752227,F30CA224687,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Relapse', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor Promoters', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States', 'Variant', 'X Inactivation', 'anticancer research', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'simulation', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,30926,0.04672705670188248
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"Predictable control of gene regulation through epigenetic engineering PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Recent landmark discoveries have revealed that in addition to DNA lesions, epigenetic mechanisms also play a major role in cancer. Epigenetics is mediated in part by interactions of proteins and DNA that confer heritable gene expression states. Drugging the cancer epigenome is a burgeoning medical technology that currently uses small molecule inhibitors and small RNAs to disrupt hyperactive epigenetic enzymes. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that a new modality, fusion proteins that interact with the chromatin fiber, will activate therapeutic genes at sites that bear a specific pattern of cancer-related biochemical marks. The specific aims are to (2) use bioinformatic analyses to discover chromosome features that support inducible changes in gene expression states and (2) to use protein engineering to identify determinants of nuclear protein engagement.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods to reactivate dormant therapeutic genes in cancer cells are limited to inhibitors that bind epigenetic enzymes and other proteins. The proposed work will establish a new technology: customizable synthetic proteins that control anti-cancer genes near cancer-associated biochemical marks.",Predictable control of gene regulation through epigenetic engineering,9827157,R21CA232244,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'C-terminal', 'Cells', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA lesion', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heritability', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nuclear Protein', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncogenes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Protein Array', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Translations', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'chromatin protein', 'design', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'new technology', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein structure', 'recruit', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic protein', 'therapeutic gene', 'therapeutic protein', 'transcription factor', 'trimethyllysine']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,179671,0.01470575421601161
"Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology There is now incontrovertible evidence from sophisticated lineage tracing studies that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) de-differentiation contributes substantively to a number of vascular diseases. A major manifesta- tion of such phenotypic change is attenuated expression of a battery of VSMC-restricted genes, including the enigmatic smooth muscle calponin (Cnn1) gene. The function of Cnn1 has been studied primarily in vitro or in a single knockout mouse wherein several exons and introns were replaced with a neo cassette which, as detailed below, obfuscates accurate interpretation of phenotypes. We have championed the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system in mice to engineer subtle substitutions within regulatory elements of many genes, leaving intact all coding sequences. We report here a remarkable phenotype wherein a single base change of a single CArG box in the Cnn1 locus abolishes expression of CNN1 in vascular (but not visceral) SMC. Full expression of CNN1 is restored with a BAC carrying human CNN1 or CRISPR-mediated activation of the en- dogenous Cnn1 promoter. Cnn1 CArG mutant mice, representing the first animal models of regulatory element edits, also show elevation in VSMC DNA synthesis and defective contractile competence. Conversely, over- expression of BAC-CNN1 suppresses VSMC growth, antagonizes neointimal formation, reduces VSMC lipid uptake, and enhances contractile gene expression. Interestingly, CNN1-Ser175 appears to be a critical residue for some of these effects making it an attractive amino acid for CRISPR-mediated editing in mice. Additional data support CNN1 as a scaffold for ERK signaling and effector of the immotile state of differentiated VSMC. Importantly, a complete understanding of CNN1 function is complicated by robust expression of two related genes (Cnn2 and Cnn3) in VSMC. We hypothesize that CNN1 functions in concert with other CNN isoforms to maintain a mature VSMC differentiated state. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims using state-of-the-art tools in genetics, animal models of disease, and molecular physiology assays of VSMC function. Aim 1 will exploit the single base edit in Cnn1 as a novel loss-of-function mouse in context of acute and chronic vascular disease models; complementation studies will be carried out in vitro and in vivo to rigorously ascribe pheno- typic changes to the specific loss of CNN1. Aim 2 will exploit a well-characterized BAC mouse to elucidate functions associated with Cnn1 gain-of-function in models of vascular disease used in Aim 1. Complementary CRISPR editing of the BAC mouse, in background of Cnn1 KO, will afford exquisite insight into functional residues that mediate CNN1 function. Aim 3 will exploit new floxed Cnn2 and Cnn3 mice with an exciting VSMC-specific Cre driver we have developed to address, for the first time, triple Cnn KO mouse models at baseline and in acute or chronic vascular disease models. These studies, based on paradigm-shifting approaches to gene KOs, serve as a template for the study of other gene families linked to VSMC differen- tiation and will inform future studies targeting CNN1 in diseases where VSMC differentiation is compromised. Diseases of blood vessels involve radical changes in the normal program of gene expression and function, the underlying nature of which is poorly understood. We have used the revolutionary CRISPR system of genome editing to study a gene called CNN1, which is specific for smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. We will study this gene, along with related genes, in both cells and blood vessels to gain new insights into vascular diseases.",Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology,9671549,R01HL136224,"['Actins', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Injury', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Introns', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'LoxP-flanked allele', 'MAPK3 gene', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'base', 'calponin', 'cell growth', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'myocardin', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vascular smooth muscle cell migration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,602307,0.010955879509515092
"Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation Summary Transcription activation, a key step in gene control, is the readout of many signaling pathways controlling cell growth, development and stress response and defects in activation cause many human diseases and syndromes. Activation typically results from factors containing activation domains (ADs) binding to coactivator complexes containing activator binding domains (ABDs). Understanding the nature of ADs, the specificity of AD-coactivator interactions, and mechanisms of coactivator cooperativity are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms used by gene-specific activators and coactivators to regulate RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. The objectives of this proposal are to determine: i) mechanisms of Mediator recruitment and its interaction with ADs, ii) mechanisms of cooperativity between Mediator and the coactivator SAGA, and iii) what constitutes a functional AD and determines the AD specificity for different coactivators and promoter types. This work will utilize an interdisciplinary combination of biochemical, structural, molecular, and computational approaches to examine transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae. To understand these mechanisms, we will build upon several breakthrough concepts and methods developed in the past grant period. We will use a combination of genomics and biochemistry to identify a new mechanism of Mediator recruitment that is likely used at many genes. We will use orthogonal approaches to determine how the coactivator SAGA stimulates genome-wide transcription, either by direct interaction with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) and/or by direct interaction with Mediator. We will determine the structural basis for AD-Mediator Tail domain interaction using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis. Finally, we will use a combination of biochemistry, genomics, and computational analysis to predict AD function and specificity and identify new mechanisms of AD-coactivator interaction. The expected outcome of these studies will be a molecular understanding of transcription activator specificity and function, mechanisms used by the coactivators Mediator and SAGA to promote transcription, and an understanding of how these factors function at different classes of genes –a leap forward in understanding widely conserved mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Project Narrative Regulation of transcription by activation of gene expression is a key mechanism for control of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Defects in activation directly contribute to many human illnesses. Our proposed work will identify conserved and widely used mechanisms for transcriptional activation that will form the molecular basis for understanding regulation of transcriptional programs in normal cells, transcriptional defects leading to human disease, and reveal fundamental information on the mechanism of transcription factors that are the readout of many signaling pathways.",Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation,9735333,R01GM075114,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Housekeeping Gene', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Polymerase', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'SAGA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Activation Domain', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell growth', 'chromatin modification', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein crosslink', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,527403,-0.008495949181928971
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,9637410,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,387500,0.030742066693606736
"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9667439,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bZIP Protein', 'base', 'cofactor', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,362238,0.04366101275356787
"Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries PROJECT SUMMARY Short sequence elements in DNA and RNA determine the levels and composition of mRNAs and proteins, making it critical that we can accurately model how any given sequence will affect transcription, splicing or translation. Such models of cis-regulation will fill in gaps in our knowledge of these core gene expression processes. Additionally, as large numbers of human genomes are sequenced, the ability to predict the effects of sequence variation on the ultimate levels of proteins will be integral to the interpretation of variation in regulatory sequences. Similarly, the construction of metabolic pathways with defined levels of expression and the engineering of synthetic gene networks require accurate knowledge of how regulatory sequences affect expression. This application seeks to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case for learning how any short regulatory sequence affects protein levels. A predictive model will be trained on a set of libraries two orders of magnitude more complex than have been characterized to date. Libraries will be generated of a growth reporter gene with a million random sequences of 50 nucleotides that comprise either a DNA element that regulates transcription or an RNA element that regulates splicing or translation. The libraries will be transformed into yeast, and the yeast will be placed under selection such that they grow according to the ability of each random sequence to contribute to protein expression. A convolution neural network approach will be used to learn the relationship between these “fitness” phenotypes and their associated genotypes. Although yeast is a single-celled eukaryote, it has been the source of most of the original findings on gene expression, and these findings form the basis for much of our knowledge of more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, the short sequences in yeast that comprise the DNA- and RNA-binding sites of regulatory proteins tend to be comparable in size to those of other organisms. Yeast is used often in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and the work proposed here will result in novel tools for quantitatively controlling its gene expression. Initial results with a library of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicate that we can construct a model to account for a large fraction of the observed variability in expression, and that the model extends to native sequence elements. The model allowed us to forward engineer 5' UTRs to have increased activity. Specific aims of this application are to assess the effects of random sequences targeted to upstream regulatory elements, core promoter elements, 5' UTRs, introns and 3' UTRs; to learn predictive and interpretable models using convolutional neural networks and to identify novel functional cis-regulatory elements; and to validate our models on native sequences and combinatorial libraries, and by engineering synthetic sequence elements with user-specified properties. In sum, the proposal seeks to construct a comprehensive and predictive model of regulatory sequence–function relationships for a well-studied single- celled eukaryote, providing a basis for similar studies on other organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research seeks to generate a model for how regulatory sequences present in the genome of a simple organism affect the expression of a protein. These studies will be important for ultimately understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease. The results will also improve the ability to engineer metabolic pathways to produce a protein, chemical, drug or other compound.",Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries,9747320,R01GM125809,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eukaryota', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Process', 'Gene Library', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sum', 'Synthetic Genes', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fitness', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'human disease', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolic engineering', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel sequencing technology', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'protein expression', 'scale up', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,374550,0.02313058388054314
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,9767099,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dura Mater', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypopituitarism', 'In Vitro', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Pituitary-dependent Cushing&apos', 's disease', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Publishing Peer Reviews', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Somatotropin', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'bone', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional status', 'genome-wide', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'methylome', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prognostic', 'small hairpin RNA', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,530660,0.006404651288611699
"C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow committed to developing an academic research group focused on applying bioinformatics to understand the pathophysiology of alcohol-related liver diseases (ALD). His previous and current postdoctoral work has given him the unique skillset to answer questions involving gene expression/regulation in the immune system. The Career Development Plan describes 2 years of mentored research wherein the candidate will develop skills in clinical immunology, generate the sequencing data outlined in the proposal, and learn leadership skills to transition into independence. The next 3 years, after obtaining an independent faculty position, will be dedicated to developing new data analysis pipelines and establishing cell biological and bioinformatics tools to understand gene regulation in the innate immune system, which will allow the candidate to establish future projects in ALD immunology. Research Plan: ALD is a spectrum of disorders that affect a growing number of people worldwide. Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that can increase the morbidity and severity of ALD disorders. In AH, the innate immune system is hypersensitive to microbial byproducts. Alcohol consumption causes gut-barrier disruption, leading to leakage of gut microbes into the portal circulation. The liver immune system is able to detect these microbes through pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin receptors (CTLs). While TLRs have been well studied for their role in sensitizing the innate immune cells to microbial products, the CTLs have only recently been implicated in mouse models of ALD. CTLs are a large family of PRRs that sense a vast diversity of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our work has found that many members of the CTL gene family are upregulated in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of AH patients. CTLs were also upregulated in PBMCs in response to LPS/TLR4 signaling. We predict CTLs are upregulated in response to gut- derived LPS in order to increase sensing for other microbes that may be present in the blood, making this pathway a secondary innate immune surveillance pathway. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in three aims to address the functional role and regulation of this immune surveillance pathway, and the mechanism by which it is exacerbated in AH. First, we will use PBMCs isolated from AH patients to measure increased sensitivity to CTL agonists, as well as micro-/mycobiome sequencing to determine what microbial byproducts were in circulation in patients. Second, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the different monocyte subclasses, variation in CTL expression, and how different cell types respond to CTL agonists. Third, because CTL genes are clustered in the genome, we will use scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) to understand co-regulation of nearby genes in the genome. Altogether, this proposal will further our understanding of CTL mediated immune surveillance in host/microbial interactions during AH disease progression and potentially identify new therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that causes significant mortality among patients with Alcohol-related liver disease. In this project, we will investigate how the innate immune system and the micro- and myco-biome interact via a family of genes called the C-type lectin receptors (CTLs) to increase inflammation and disease severity among AH patients. The results of this project will expand our understanding of CTLs and immune surveillance, and provide new therapeutic targets for treatment of AH.",C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD,9870331,K99AA028048,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcohols', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'C Type Lectin Receptors', 'C-Type Lectins', 'CD14 gene', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Immunology', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elements', 'Ethanol Metabolism', 'Extravasation', 'FCGR3B gene', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Fungal Components', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunology', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myelogenous', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'TLR4 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toll-like receptors', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transposase', 'Up-Regulation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cytokine', 'dectin 1', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fungus', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'immunological diversity', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory milieu', 'liver inflammation', 'liver injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'mouse dectin-2', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'prevent', 'receptor expression', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIAAA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K99,2019,123096,0.0036245525364677535
"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions.

"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,9462855,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Canes', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Encyclopedias', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'cancer genome', 'cancer subtypes', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,327823,0.05676508103821713
"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases.

"FASEB SRC on Transcription, Chromatin, & Epigenetics Summary The goal of this meeting is to cover the regulation and role of epigenetic mechanisms at the nexus between aging and cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms encompass post-translational modifications of chromatin and RNA as well as transcriptional regulation. This FASEB meeting will be unique in integrating the latest discoveries in epigenetics and their importance in aging and cancer. Indeed, exciting recent studies have revealed how organismal aging can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. As age is one of the largest risk factors for cancer, epigenetic dysfunction could provide a long sought after link between aging and cancer. There is a vital need for such a meeting. The field of epigenetic is rapidly expanding, and the aging and cancer fields need to benefit from the latest and greatest discoveries in this area. Conversely, challenges and questions about the role of epigenetics in aging and cancer abound, and it is critical for researchers in the chromatin and transcription fields to better grasp the implications of their work for health and disease. This FASEB meeting will discuss the most cutting-edge questions in field of chromatin, transcription, and epigenetics. A key topic will be the underlying molecular basis of epigenetic mechanisms. The question of how these mechanisms get dysregulated during disease or normal aging will also be discussed. The meeting will also cover new frontiers, including the contribution of non-coding RNA to epigenetic mechanisms and the exciting emerging field of RNA epigenetic. The meeting will particularly focus on transformative epigenomic technologies and machine learning approaches and how they can be used to interrogate changes in epigenetic landscapes in cells from individuals at different ages or in different types of cancers. This meeting should foster new fundamental knowledge and information, new methodology and technical capabilities, and interdisciplinary collaborations. The meeting will also provide a uniquely interactive forum for trainees and new investigators, highlighting their research through short talks, poster teasers and sessions and promoting several networking and meet-the-expert events. ! !

"New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Cellular state transitions (i.e. from pluripotent to committed, replicative to quiescent, etc.) require the  coordinated regulation of thousands of genes. Therapeutically harnessing these transitions holds great  promise for human health;; for instance, autologous stem cell therapy has been successfully used in  regenerative medicine and cancer treatments, among others. While some of the key regulatory switches are  known, the field lacks a systems-­level understanding of the genomic circuits that control these transitions,  information that is critical for informed clinical intervention. Here, we will develop an integrated computational  framework to identify core gene regulatory circuits from large gene networks and predict their dynamics and  regulatory functions without the need of detailed network kinetic parameters. Advances in genomics profiling  technology have enabled the mapping of gene regulatory networks, thus we now have the capacity to identify  combinatorial interactions among genes and the master regulators of state transitions. Some systems biology  approaches have simulated the dynamics of a gene regulatory circuit, but traditional methods suffer from two  key issues. First, there is no rational rule to choose an appropriate set of regulator genes in a large network to  model. Second, since it is hard to directly measure most network kinetic parameters from experiment,  modeling results are based on a set of guessed parameters that can be less than optimal, limiting the  application of mathematical modeling to large systems and the prediction power of systems biology. To  address these issues, we recently developed algorithm named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE). RACIPE  generates an ensemble of circuit models, each of which corresponds to a distinct set of random kinetic  parameters, and uniquely identifies robust features, such as clusters of stable gene expression states, by  statistical analysis. We will further enhance RACIPE algorithms for large systems and new data analysis tools  using machine learning. This approach will convert a traditional nonlinear dynamics problem into a data  analysis problem, an essential step for extending the application of gene circuit modeling to large systems. It  also provides a novel strategy to integrate top-­down genomics approaches with bottom-­up mathematical  modeling. The algorithms will be tested and refined using literature-­based gene networks, public genomics  data, and data from collaboration, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state  transitions in oncogenesis. Success of the project will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene  regulatory mechanism of cellular decision-­making in any cell of interest. The algorithmic development is   expected to have a broad impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on  therapeutic intervention in genomic medicine.      RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Most human complex diseases are multigenic, but our understanding of the interactions between genes in  healthy states and how they are disrupted in disease states is lacking. Computational algorithms will be  designed to construct and model gene regulatory circuits of higher complexity to fill an important gap in our  understanding of the maintenance and transitions among cellular states and their abnormal behavior in  disease. In this proposal, we will develop a suite of systems-­biology tools to extend gene circuit modeling to  large systems and integrate genomics data relevant to fundamental cell biology, cancer, and other human  diseases.   ",New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits,9574761,R35GM128717,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autologous', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Public Health', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'novel strategies', 'stem cell therapy', 'success', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2018,437500,0.03218848945748445
"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,9672649,R01GM131398,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,325001,-0.0007055874214644088
"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9576241,R35GM128938,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distal', 'Experimental Designs', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graph theory', 'histone modification', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'statistics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2018,449829,0.024789205521563183
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9552890,R01GM120167,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,543228,-0.0009927748016314859
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research. This next cycle of funding will expand the definition of gene expression across the immune system, analyze how its regulatory hierarchy relates to immune responses.

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9543532,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,400001,0.009156137012959972
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,9564894,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'human disease', 'human model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2018,2270717,0.019593286783661183
"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. We propose to develop a new computational approach to use genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in primary tumors to understand the regulatory landscape of these subpopulations. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Results from this work will improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms of B cell lymphoma development and relapse.",Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations,9521585,R21LM012395,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'Biological', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expression Profiling', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mixed Cellular Population', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Normal Cell', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,193265,0.01926623510573673
"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9470767,F31CA221061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tweens', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2018,38615,0.03016825986101541
"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm.

"UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The simplest conceptual model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. In this “independent action model”, if the TF has an activation domain, it activates the genes whose promoters it binds; if it has a repression domain, it represses the genes whose promoters it binds. It is remarkable then, that in existing, comprehensive data sets, that the vast majority of genes whose promoters are bound by a TF show no change in expression when the TF is knocked down or knocked out. In yeast data where all TFs have been analyzed, only 3-5% of bound genes respond when the TF is knocked out; in more recent, but less comprehensive human data it is rarely more than 15%. Furthermore, nearly every TF appears to activate some of the genes it binds while repressing others. These data show that we do not have a credible rough draft map of the regulatory logic of any eukaryote, as most of the genes bound by a TF in existing data are not regulated by that TF and we do not know how to predict which ones are. Our preliminary results show that some, but clearly not all, of the problem can be explained by technical issues inherent to the existing datasets. We there propose to generate new, comprehensive data sets that are ideally suited to studying the relationship between binding and functional regulation (Aim 1). We will use these datasets to quantify the predictive power of the independent action model. In Aim 2, we will collect genome- wide data focused understanding the interactions between TF binding and local chromatin state to see we can use the information to extend the independent action model to increase its predictive power. Finally, we will collect genome-wide data to identify TF-TF interactions that affect the gene expression response to perturbation. We will assess the predictive power of this information using computational models. This project will produce the first consistent data set that is well suited to studying the relationship between TF binding and regulation as well as the first credible overview of regulatory logic for any eukaryote. At the conclusion, we will know why perturbation of a TF apparently activates some of the genes it binds, represses other genes it binds, and does nothing at all to most of the genes it binds. Is it just the limitations of existing high-throughput data sets, or do interactions dominate independent action? What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The textbook model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. But the reality is that existing, large genomic data sets do not support this model. The proposed project will generate new genomic data sets to directly address this problem, and will investigate to what extent TF-chromatin and TF-TF interactions affect the relationship between TF binding and gene expression.",UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION,9578803,R01GM129126,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Eukaryota', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histones', 'Knock-out', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Repression', 'Resources', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ursidae Family', 'Writing', 'Yeasts', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'knock-down', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'promoter', 'response', 'success', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,311500,0.004732259762885521
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9527869,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,472477,0.026194075749691653
"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9490337,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,397299,0.06025795233439315
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9550852,R21HG009268,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'ds-DNA', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,266250,0.036629722554657344
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",9425925,R01HG009906,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Imagery', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,383250,0.03376458516163095
"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9450518,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bZIP Protein', 'base', 'cofactor', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,362333,0.04366101275356787
"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types.

"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,9500095,R01HG010045,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'markov model', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,411292,0.03840152318230345
"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,9472348,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'differential expression', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome browser', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,343125,0.0823599257883916
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,9521770,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2018,592501,0.013340202435537067
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,9580729,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dura Mater', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypopituitarism', 'In Vitro', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Pituitary-dependent Cushing&apos', 's disease', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Publishing Peer Reviews', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Somatotropin', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'bone', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional status', 'genome-wide', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'methylome', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prognostic', 'small hairpin RNA', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,562135,0.006404651288611699
"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,9483343,R01HL126947,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Decitabine', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distal', 'Drug resistance', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hypercellular Bone Marrow', 'Hypermethylation', 'ITGB3 gene', 'Ineffective Hematopoiesis', 'Introns', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Molecular', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'PPBP gene', 'Pancytopenia', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'cytopenia', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'in vivo', 'ineffective therapies', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular marker', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'unnecessary treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,389800,0.037175487234866876
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,9420630,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,387500,0.030742066693606736
"Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation Summary Transcription activation, a key step in gene control, is the readout of many signaling pathways controlling cell growth, development and stress response and defects in activation cause many human diseases and syndromes. Activation typically results from factors containing activation domains (ADs) binding to coactivator complexes containing activator binding domains (ABDs). Understanding the nature of ADs, the specificity of AD-coactivator interactions, and mechanisms of coactivator cooperativity are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms used by gene-specific activators and coactivators to regulate RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. The objectives of this proposal are to determine: i) mechanisms of Mediator recruitment and its interaction with ADs, ii) mechanisms of cooperativity between Mediator and the coactivator SAGA, and iii) what constitutes a functional AD and determines the AD specificity for different coactivators and promoter types. This work will utilize an interdisciplinary combination of biochemical, structural, molecular, and computational approaches to examine transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae. To understand these mechanisms, we will build upon several breakthrough concepts and methods developed in the past grant period. We will use a combination of genomics and biochemistry to identify a new mechanism of Mediator recruitment that is likely used at many genes. We will use orthogonal approaches to determine how the coactivator SAGA stimulates genome-wide transcription, either by direct interaction with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) and/or by direct interaction with Mediator. We will determine the structural basis for AD-Mediator Tail domain interaction using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis. Finally, we will use a combination of biochemistry, genomics, and computational analysis to predict AD function and specificity and identify new mechanisms of AD-coactivator interaction. The expected outcome of these studies will be a molecular understanding of transcription activator specificity and function, mechanisms used by the coactivators Mediator and SAGA to promote transcription, and an understanding of how these factors function at different classes of genes –a leap forward in understanding widely conserved mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Project Narrative Regulation of transcription by activation of gene expression is a key mechanism for control of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Defects in activation directly contribute to many human illnesses. Our proposed work will identify conserved and widely used mechanisms for transcriptional activation that will form the molecular basis for understanding regulation of transcriptional programs in normal cells, transcriptional defects leading to human disease, and reveal fundamental information on the mechanism of transcription factors that are the readout of many signaling pathways.",Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation,9613971,R01GM075114,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Housekeeping Gene', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Polymerase', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'SAGA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Activation Domain', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell growth', 'chromatin modification', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein crosslink', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,546403,-0.008495949181928971
"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",9420631,U01HG009395,"['ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2018,717318,0.05936506076142235
"Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries PROJECT SUMMARY Short sequence elements in DNA and RNA determine the levels and composition of mRNAs and proteins, making it critical that we can accurately model how any given sequence will affect transcription, splicing or translation. Such models of cis-regulation will fill in gaps in our knowledge of these core gene expression processes. Additionally, as large numbers of human genomes are sequenced, the ability to predict the effects of sequence variation on the ultimate levels of proteins will be integral to the interpretation of variation in regulatory sequences. Similarly, the construction of metabolic pathways with defined levels of expression and the engineering of synthetic gene networks require accurate knowledge of how regulatory sequences affect expression. This application seeks to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case for learning how any short regulatory sequence affects protein levels. A predictive model will be trained on a set of libraries two orders of magnitude more complex than have been characterized to date. Libraries will be generated of a growth reporter gene with a million random sequences of 50 nucleotides that comprise either a DNA element that regulates transcription or an RNA element that regulates splicing or translation. The libraries will be transformed into yeast, and the yeast will be placed under selection such that they grow according to the ability of each random sequence to contribute to protein expression. A convolution neural network approach will be used to learn the relationship between these “fitness” phenotypes and their associated genotypes. Although yeast is a single-celled eukaryote, it has been the source of most of the original findings on gene expression, and these findings form the basis for much of our knowledge of more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, the short sequences in yeast that comprise the DNA- and RNA-binding sites of regulatory proteins tend to be comparable in size to those of other organisms. Yeast is used often in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and the work proposed here will result in novel tools for quantitatively controlling its gene expression. Initial results with a library of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicate that we can construct a model to account for a large fraction of the observed variability in expression, and that the model extends to native sequence elements. The model allowed us to forward engineer 5' UTRs to have increased activity. Specific aims of this application are to assess the effects of random sequences targeted to upstream regulatory elements, core promoter elements, 5' UTRs, introns and 3' UTRs; to learn predictive and interpretable models using convolutional neural networks and to identify novel functional cis-regulatory elements; and to validate our models on native sequences and combinatorial libraries, and by engineering synthetic sequence elements with user-specified properties. In sum, the proposal seeks to construct a comprehensive and predictive model of regulatory sequence–function relationships for a well-studied single- celled eukaryote, providing a basis for similar studies on other organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research seeks to generate a model for how regulatory sequences present in the genome of a simple organism affect the expression of a protein. These studies will be important for ultimately understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.

"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions. We will generate genome-wide temporal profiles of chromatin state and gene expression during nuclear reprogramming, learn integrative models of dynamic gene regulation and perform experiments to validate biological hypotheses generated by the model.",Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming,9368022,R01HG009674,"['ATAC-seq', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Fate Control', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell fusion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements', 'Event', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Pattern', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'RNA Interference', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'combinatorial', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'heterokaryon', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'nuclear reprogramming', 'pluripotency', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,694416,0.07144461768711868
"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9240483,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'clinical biomarkers', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-doctoral', 'public health relevance', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2017,39597,0.052986486590123665
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9382313,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'learning network', 'men', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2017,471007,0.005409906573659042
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions.

"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9356566,R01GM120167,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,463781,-0.0009927748016314859
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium. ImmGen has positively impacted immunological research in the current decade, providing detailed and rigorous genomic resolution of immune populations, informed by a strong understanding of their immunology. This is what we will continue and amplify. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through the high quality gene expression data it has generated, ImmGen has become an important resource in Immunology research.

"Separating Wheat from Chaff in Major Depression Blood Biomarker Studies Project Summary Blood expression profiling of major depression disorder (MDD) patients has the potential to refine disease classification and diagnosis, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and improve drug targeting and clinical trial outcomes. However, the only significant finding in the largest MDD blood RNA study, a recent RNAseq profiling of 922 individuals comparing MDD patients with healthy controls, was a composite increase in the expression of genes associated with the interferon response pathway in MDD. Statistical analysis of such datasets is complicated by disease heterogeneity and by sources of inter-individual gene expression variation, such as high person-to-person differences in human blood cell type proportions, making it difficult to find measurements that robustly distinguish clinical groups. We have recently developed latent variable based computational approaches that more effectively model heterogeneity including blood proportions in blood gene expression data and that improve the identification of disease associated differentially expressed genes and disease-associated differences in cell type proportions. We have demonstrated that our methods increase the power to detect differentially expressed genes and improve agreement among separate studies of disease-associated global RNA expression. The latent variable framework we use can be exploited for interpreting the observed changes by attributing them to specific blood cell types. Preliminary analysis using these approaches on the large recent MDD RNAseq dataset finds evidence for additional depression related signatures and differentially expressed RNAs not detected by the original analysis. Analysis of the association of these signatures with acute symptoms and their stability over time in individuals suggests that they are most likely novel MDD trait markers. We will apply this enhanced methodology to identify novel MDD-associated genes in this large RNAseq dataset, confirm these signatures by analysis of other MDD public datasets, investigate the state/trait and genetic basis for these signatures and use machine learning to generate a purely clinical and biological data-driven classification of depression subgroups. This study is expected to result in an improved analysis framework for blood RNA biomarkers studies of psychiatric disease, significant new insight into MDD associated cell type proportion and blood gene expression trait signatures, and the identification of molecularly coherent depression subgroups. Project Narrative We have developed new computational methods that improve the ability to identify blood gene expression changes in genome-wide studies of blood in MDD. We will apply enhanced versions of these methods to investigate public MDD datasets.

"Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits Project Summary A better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and implicated genes across populations has implications for precision medicine and can only be accomplished by studying the genetic architecture of complex traits in diverse populations. For many complex traits, gene regulation is likely to play a crucial mechanistic role given the consistent enrichment of regulatory variants among trait-associated variants. We have developed a gene-level association method called PrediXcan that harnesses the regulatory knowledge generated by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies to directly test for genes associated with complex traits. An advantage of this gene-based approach over other aggregate variant approaches is that the results are inherently mechanistic and provide directionality, guiding follow-up experiments and future drug development. The genetic contribution to population phenotypic differentiation is driven by differences in causal allele frequencies, effect sizes, and genetic architectures. We propose to broaden the scope of PrediXcan to include diverse populations by (1) optimizing predictors of gene expression within and across diverse populations in multiple tissues and (2) performing gene-level association studies and quantifying regulability on a range of phenotypes in non-European populations. We will use machine learning to optimize predictive models of gene expression in datasets with both genome-wide genotype and gene expression data. We will integrate prior results from larger European populations when appropriate. Based on preliminary results, we expect a range of predictive power (assessed by cross-validation R2) will be observed across genes dependent on the heritability of each gene expression trait and differences in allele frequencies and effect sizes among populations. We will compare populations by 1) calculating the correlation between heritability estimates and cross-validated prediction performance and by 2) by calculating trans-population genetic effect size correlations (allele frequency independent) and trans-population genetic impact correlations (allele frequency dependent). The optimal models will also inform the underlying genetic architectures (sparse vs. polygenic) of gene expression traits and how they vary across populations. As we have done for European populations, the predictive models and heritability estimates developed here will be added to an open access database for use in PrediXcan and other studies. We hypothesize that PrediXcan will increase power to identify genes and implicate mechanisms underlying complex traits and that we can quantify the overall effect of phenotypic variation explained by transcriptome regulation within and across populations. We will compare gene-level results across populations to determine if the same and/or unique genes and pathways are implicated for a particular phenotype. We will estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained collectively by all gene expression levels, which we name the regulability of a trait. All results, scripts, and software will be available in publicly accessible databases and repositories. Project Narrative Differences in DNA sequence among individuals can lead to differences in gene expression levels, which in turn can lead to trait differences. We have developed a method that harnesses these DNA differences to predict gene expression levels, which are then tested for correlation with a disease or other trait of interest. Our project will lead to a better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and implicated genes across populations, which has the potential to improve the implementation of precision medicine among diverse populations and reduce health disparities.",Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits,9304684,R15HG009569,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological', 'Cholesterol', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'European', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'data access', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NHGRI,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R15,2017,429000,0.01165963770613792
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9459529,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,400000,0.009156137012959972
"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. We propose to develop a new computational approach to use genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in primary tumors to understand the regulatory landscape of these subpopulations. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Results from this work will improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms of B cell lymphoma development and relapse.",Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations,9317775,R21LM012395,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'Biological', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mixed Cellular Population', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Normal Cell', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,220064,0.01926623510573673
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs.

"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identifynovelcellsubtypesthroughchangesintheexpressionrelationshipsbetweengenes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expressionprofilesislikelytobenefitfromavarietyofapproaches.Inordertofindagreementbetweenthose approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9398289,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,472477,0.024617725013312757
"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9280975,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,397299,0.06025795233439315
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale.

"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions. The control over which doors are open in a cell regulates which instructions are accessible in a cell-type specific way.

"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,9253408,R01GM113708,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'differential expression', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,284959,0.03513047945881426
"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states.

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9276695,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bZIP Protein', 'base', 'cofactor', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,356861,0.04366101275356787
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,9263991,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'differential expression', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome browser', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,343125,0.0823599257883916
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9341310,R21ES027878,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Collection', 'Conceptus', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Placenta', 'Placental Biology', 'Placentation', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Procedures', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Syncytiotrophoblast', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Uterine cavity', 'Villous', 'age effect', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytotrophoblast', 'design', 'developmental toxicology', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personal care products', 'phthalates', 'postnatal', 'prospective', 'response', 'study population', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2017,191131,0.03477775343591275
"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,9268794,R01HL126947,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Decitabine', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distal', 'Drug resistance', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hypercellular Bone Marrow', 'Hypermethylation', 'ITGB3 gene', 'Ineffective Hematopoiesis', 'Introns', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'PPBP gene', 'Pancytopenia', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'cytopenia', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'in vivo', 'ineffective therapies', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular marker', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'unnecessary treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,390375,0.037175487234866876
"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9038173,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'clinical biomarkers', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-doctoral', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2016,39129,0.052986486590123665
"Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. The RNAi technique is widely used in both biological research and clinical applications because it has the ability to knockdown essentially any gene of interest. However, one major unresolved issue in RNAi studies is non-specific gene silencing. It is well known that, in addition to the single intended gene target, many unintended targets are also simultaneously silenced. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for improving RNAi specificity. RNAi specificity and potency are determined by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the silencing complex. We propose the hypothesis that gene silencing specificity can be significantly improved with rational siRNA design. We have previously developed a machine learning algorithm for the design of widely-distributed commercial siRNAs. Based on this commercial success, we propose to further develop a new method for genome-wide design of next-generation siRNAs with significantly reduced off-target effects. The new design method will lay a solid foundation for further commercial development of siRNA products that can be used in a variety of RNAi-based applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. RNAi has many diverse applications as it can suppress almost any human genes by recognizing the gene sequence. We propose to remove a major hurdle in RNAi studies by genome-wide design of siRNAs with significantly improved gene silencing specificity.",Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown,9146385,R41HG008567,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput RNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Process', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Sequence Analysis', 'RNA interference screen', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'biological research', 'clinical application', 'design', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,"NAWGEN, LLC",R41,2016,349932,0.004271166877523382
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,9042426,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'cancer genome', 'cancer subtypes', 'data mining', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'drug mechanism', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,328232,0.05676508103821713
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9157021,R01GM120167,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Elements', 'Endoderm', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Hour', 'Human Genetics', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supporting Cell', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,404036,-0.0009927748016314859
"The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states Abstract  In the last decade it has become increasingly apparent that epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression play an important role in brain function and dysfunction. Disruption in neuroepigenetic developmental processes such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation result in mental retardation and cognitive impairments. More recently, neuroepigenetic processes have also been implicated in adult behaviors, such as addiction and memory. This opens the possibility that these mechanisms may be able to control the establishment and maintenance of behavioral states. However, the underlying mechanisms through which neuroepigenetic processes can mediate changes in circuit excitability to determine behavioral states remain mysterious. Moreover, because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the mammalian brain, we have no knowledge about the genetic loci of integration between the environment and behavior, and the identity of the neural pathways that control them in specific circuits. This presents a major roadblock towards unlocking the interface between brain and environment and their role in human health and disease. Here we propose a three-prong solution to this problem by using: a brain that shows conserved neurochemistry and neuroepigenetic mechanisms, but with orders of magnitude fewer neurons and homogenous circuits compared to mammalian brains, behaviors that are regulated by the environment (hunger and satiety), and an environment that is experimentally controllable (fasting vs. re-feeding; normal diet vs. high sugar diet). Changes in the excitability and plasticity of conserved circuits determine outputs feeding states like hunger and satiety. These changes occur slow, are persistent over hours, depend on the physiological state and are bidirectional. Thus, they could be encoded neuroepigenetically to alter the expression of key genes important to modulate circuit excitability. Furthermore, because a large number of metabolism intermediates functions as cofactors for chromatin modifying enzymes, physiological changes in metabolites and nutrients can directly alter gene expression. My lab has pioneered techniques and established unique collaborations to address the functional role of neuroepigenetic processes in regulating the activity of specific circuits in the context of feeding states. We propose to map how environmental inputs act on chromatin and gene expression to direct the changes in neuronal excitability that underlie output feeding behaviors. First, we will identify the specific chromatin pathways that act in a unique circuit important to switch the behavioral state of the fly between hungry and sated. We will then map the functional genetic loci of integration between physiological state and output behavioral states by examining the occupancy of these pathways on chromatin and their effect on behavior and neural activity. We will then dissect how changes in environmental input (energy scarcity in fasting, energy availability in re-feeding, and energy surplus in a high sugar diet) directly affect gene expression by altering the activity of these pathways and their genetic loci of integration. To this end, we will work with analytical chemists to develop new methods to measure changes in metabolites in the blood, brain and specific circuits and with computational biologists to harness machine learning analysis to integrate metabolism and gene expression datasets to identify the molecular pathways that act at the interface between input and effector mechanisms to regulate output behavioral states. Because the endocrine and physiological changes that underlie hunger and satiety are evolutionary conserved, our approach will provide a model of how the environment can functionally determine bidirectional, flip-flop behavioral states through neuroepigenetic mechanisms. More broadly, these studies will uncover how epigenetic mechanisms may function as gatekeepers of “behavioral states” (normal and abnormal), to provide the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the “conditioning” effect of environments (from nutrients to maternal care) on neural plasticity. Public Health Relevance Statement: The proposed study will identify how nutrients in diet play a key role in regulating hunger and satiety states by changing neuronal activity and behavior. This will pave the way to understanding how the increased consumption of calories is linked to diseases such as depression, cancer, aging and neurodegeneration. More broadly, these experiments will identify in detail the molecular and physiological adaptations of a cellular system to a changing environment, develop new methodologies to study metabolism, and computational tool to integrate large orthogonal gene expression and metabolism datasets.",The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states,9167992,DP2DK113750,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Calories', 'Caring', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data Set', 'Developmental Process', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fasting', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Functional disorder', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hunger', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Retardation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Nutrient', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Adaptation', 'Play', 'Process', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'addiction', 'brain behavior', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'conditioning', 'feeding', 'fly', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'neurochemistry', 'neuronal excitability', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sugar']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,DP2,2016,2009885,0.007667333506701967
"Separating Wheat from Chaff in Major Depression Blood Biomarker Studies Project Summary Blood expression profiling of major depression disorder (MDD) patients has the potential to refine disease classification and diagnosis, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and improve drug targeting and clinical trial outcomes. However, the only significant finding in the largest MDD blood RNA study, a recent RNAseq profiling of 922 individuals comparing MDD patients with healthy controls, was a composite increase in the expression of genes associated with the interferon response pathway in MDD. Statistical analysis of such datasets is complicated by disease heterogeneity and by sources of inter-individual gene expression variation, such as high person-to-person differences in human blood cell type proportions, making it difficult to find measurements that robustly distinguish clinical groups. We have recently developed latent variable based computational approaches that more effectively model heterogeneity including blood proportions in blood gene expression data and that improve the identification of disease associated differentially expressed genes and disease-associated differences in cell type proportions. We have demonstrated that our methods increase the power to detect differentially expressed genes and improve agreement among separate studies of disease-associated global RNA expression. The latent variable framework we use can be exploited for interpreting the observed changes by attributing them to specific blood cell types. Preliminary analysis using these approaches on the large recent MDD RNAseq dataset finds evidence for additional depression related signatures and differentially expressed RNAs not detected by the original analysis. Analysis of the association of these signatures with acute symptoms and their stability over time in individuals suggests that they are most likely novel MDD trait markers. We will apply this enhanced methodology to identify novel MDD-associated genes in this large RNAseq dataset, confirm these signatures by analysis of other MDD public datasets, investigate the state/trait and genetic basis for these signatures and use machine learning to generate a purely clinical and biological data-driven classification of depression subgroups. This study is expected to result in an improved analysis framework for blood RNA biomarkers studies of psychiatric disease, significant new insight into MDD associated cell type proportion and blood gene expression trait signatures, and the identification of molecularly coherent depression subgroups. Project Narrative We have developed new computational methods that improve the ability to identify blood gene expression changes in genome-wide studies of blood in MDD. We will apply enhanced versions of these methods to investigate public MDD datasets.

"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013).     This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr. Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr. Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr. John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.     During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies.     The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project. Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data.

"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). We propose to perform a comprehensive screen of more than 450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome using DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sorted cell populations, and labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from SS cases and control individuals to identify epigenetic profiles that are predictive of disease risk and specifi clinical phenotypes. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of several different cell and tissue types and whole genome SNP data have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, and may lead to more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.",Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome,8991063,R03DE024316,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Budgets', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human DNA', 'interest', 'member', 'monocyte', 'repository', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2016,237102,0.037085338288228784
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs. Our models will serve as a resource to provide comprehensive context-specific regulatory annotations for disease-associated gene sets and co-expression modules.",Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation,9351660,R01ES025009,"['Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Indium', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Play', 'Process', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,150000,0.03352433873798188
"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9066171,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'chromosomal location', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'empowered', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'promoter', 'research study', 'synthetic genomics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,397299,0.06025795233439315
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9206289,R21HG009268,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'ds-DNA', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,0.036629722554657344
"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions. The control over which doors are open in a cell regulates which instructions are accessible in a cell-type specific way. We will understand the code that controls the doors to our genome, and improve human health by understanding what genome changes interfere with door control and demonstrating that we can program cells to open and close their doors to create cells that might be able to serve as replacements for damaged cells in our bodies.",High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility,9066734,R01HG008363,"['Access to Information', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Etiology', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Pancreas', 'Proteins', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'gain of function', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stem cell differentiation', 'syntax', 'synthetic construct', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,748525,0.02313175665558858
"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease.

To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,9038385,R01GM113708,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Shapes', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'differential expression', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,284106,0.03513047945881426
"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4).

"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases. Our formal modeling and experimental tests will open windows of insight to improve application of basic research in gene regulation to clinical studies.",VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data,9183143,R24DK106766,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Science', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Erythroid Cells', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'feeding', 'gene conservation', 'genome browser', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'loss of function', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NIDDK,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R24,2016,1324873,0.05997400100176894
"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.            ",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9106490,R01GM051946,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Body Patterning', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Drosophila genus', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Order', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Formation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Repression', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cofactor', 'fly', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'loss of function mutation', 'morphogens', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,360706,0.04366101275356787
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,9058561,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'differential expression', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome browser', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,343125,0.0823599257883916
"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9197555,R21ES027878,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Collection', 'Conceptus', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Procedures', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Syncytiotrophoblast', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Uterine cavity', 'Villous', 'abstracting', 'age effect', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytotrophoblast', 'design', 'developmental toxicology', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personal care products', 'phthalates', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'response', 'study population', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2016,245727,0.03477775343591275
"Primate Embryo Gene Expression Resource DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Primate Embryo Gene Expression Resource (PREGER) advances the biology of nonhuman primate (NHP) and human oocytes and embryos, recognizing the significant limitations of rodent and other models to inform us about key aspects of human reproductive biology.

"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,9099915,R01HL126947,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Decitabine', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distal', 'Drug resistance', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hypermethylation', 'Ineffective Hematopoiesis', 'Introns', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'PPBP gene', 'Pancytopenia', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'cytopenia', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'in vivo', 'ineffective therapies', 'methylation biomarker', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular marker', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'unnecessary treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,390375,0.037175487234866876
"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns.

"Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. The RNAi technique is widely used in both biological research and clinical applications because it has the ability to knockdown essentially any gene of interest. However, one major unresolved issue in RNAi studies is non-specific gene silencing. It is well known that, in addition to the single intended gene target, many unintended targets are also simultaneously silenced. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for improving RNAi specificity. RNAi specificity and potency are determined by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the silencing complex. We propose the hypothesis that gene silencing specificity can be significantly improved with rational siRNA design. We have previously developed a machine learning algorithm for the design of widely-distributed commercial siRNAs. Based on this commercial success, we propose to further develop a new method for genome-wide design of next-generation siRNAs with significantly reduced off-target effects. The new design method will lay a solid foundation for further commercial development of siRNA products that can be used in a variety of RNAi-based applications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. RNAi has many diverse applications as it can suppress almost any human genes by recognizing the gene sequence. We propose to remove a major hurdle in RNAi studies by genome-wide design of siRNAs with significantly improved gene silencing specificity.            ",Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown,8978283,R41HG008567,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput RNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Process', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'biological research', 'clinical application', 'design', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'interest', 'next generation', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,"NAWGEN, LLC",R41,2015,246414,0.004271166877523382
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,8798024,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'cancer genome', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug mechanism', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,343551,0.0568009515923376
"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells. The efficacy and biocompatibility (toxicity) of polymers and combination treatments will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo (in mice).",Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods,8786566,R01GM093229,"['Affinity', 'Amines', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Apoptosis', 'Biocompatible', 'Biodistribution', 'Cells', 'Combinatorial Synthesis', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA delivery', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Ethers', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transduction Agent', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Hydrophobicity', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Viral Vector', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids', 'Polyamines', 'Polymers', 'Property', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'SCID Mice', 'Structure', 'TNFSF10 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Viral Vector', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'bone', 'cancer cell', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene therapy', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'luminescence', 'milligram', 'model design', 'monomer', 'multitask', 'nanoparticle', 'non-viral gene delivery', 'novel', 'prostate cancer cell', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'trafficking', 'transgene expression', 'vector', 'zeta potential']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2015,289337,0.017684819154276856
"CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop novel computational methods to identify regulatory elements in repetitive regions of the genomes using publicly available data from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE. Half of the human genome is derived from transposable elements (TEs). These highly repetitive elements were recently shown to harbor transcription factor (TF) binding sites and epigenetic regulatory signals. TEs have shaped gene regulatory networks during evolution and are dysregulated in many diseases. However, the extent to which TEs contribute to regulatory networks, and how TE sequences evolved from parasitic DNA to functional elements, remains unclear. In this proposal, we introduce a computational framework to identify TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers and to estimate the evolutionary impact of TEs to cell type-specific gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to develop an epigenomics-based approach to detect TE-derived enhancers and their target genes. Extending our recent success in developing machine learning methods to integrate DNA methylation data, we will bring to bear computational models that allow us to predict TE-derived enhancers. If successful, not only will we produce the largest catalog of TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers, but also have created a robust framework for detecting the contributions of TEs to gene regulation in any cell type or tissue. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop a TE epigenetic association assay. By taking advantage of the multi-copy nature of TE sequences, we will identify TE sequence variations or features that associate with specific epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will reconstruct sequences of the evolutionary intermediates of candidate TEs and estimate their epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will address questions including whether particular classes of TEs gained TF-binding sites and then spread quickly, or whether TEs first spread and later gained TF binding sites. If successful, we will develop an understanding of what sequence features drive the functional potential of TEs, and the modes of evolution followed by different TEs during regulatory network evolution. Such an understanding will dramatically improve our picture of regulatory network evolution by including the effects of TEs, a major class of fast evolving regulatory sequences that have been largely ignored in functional genomics studies. In Specific Aim 3 we will create a public resource based on our newly invented Repeat Element Browser to allow investigators to display, analyze, compare, and integrate Roadmap/ENCODE data and their own data on TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of data produced by consortia such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and TCGA, which currently discard most TE derived sequences. Such improvement will in turn accelerate research into understanding the impact of TEs on normal gene regulation and in human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transposable elements (TEs) are a special class of DNA sequences which copy themselves and ""hop"" to many different locations in the genome. TEs are often referred to as ""junk"" DNA or ""parasitic"" DNA, but they are more and more implicated in genome evolution, gene regulation and diseases. These elements comprise a huge fraction of the DNA in mammalian genomes, including 50% of the human genome. Because of their repetitive nature they are generally discarded in most genomics studies. We recently showed that these elements often carry regulatory sequences that are co-opted by host genomes to perform normal gene regulation. Here we propose to study the extent to which TEs contribute to normal gene regulation throughout the genome and how mis-regulation of TE derived sequences contributes to disease.",CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS,8928618,R01ES024992,"['Address', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Junk DNA', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mammalian genome', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,152500,0.009343527565654304
"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013).     This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr. Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr. Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr. John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.     During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies.     The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project. Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data.

"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS).

The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of several different cell and tissue types and whole genome SNP data have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, and may lead to more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.                ",Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome,8829521,R03DE024316,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Budgets', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human DNA', 'interest', 'member', 'monocyte', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'systemic autoimmune disease']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2015,236912,0.037085338288228784
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia.

"ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.            ",ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER,8888066,R01GM092910,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Positioning', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cellular engineering', 'chromatin modification', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'empowered', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'insight', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,397299,0.06085432108574389
"Epigenomic control of RNA splicing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this project is to elucidate the roles of epigenetics and chromatin states in RNA splicing regulation. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and as a consequence exceedingly complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in creating this regulatory diversity by generating multiple RNA isoforms from a single gene. Traditionally, splicing was considered as a ""post-transcriptional"" process, and studies of splicing regulation have largely focused on the roles of cis splicing regulatory elements and their interactions with canonical RNA-binding splicing factors. However, recent studies of eukaryotic epigenomes and transcriptomes have revealed a surprisingly complex picture of splicing regulation shaped by chromatin states and epigenetic marks. Exons are characterized by increased levels of nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and certain histone modifications. Many introns are spliced co-transcriptionally when the nascent RNAs are tethered to the chromatin, and changes in the transcription elongation rate or epigenetic marks can influence exon splicing patterns. Despite these exciting findings, many questions about epigenetic regulation of splicing remain unresolved. We propose to systematically investigate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing, by taking advantage of the broad and deep epigenome and transcriptome data generated by the Epigenome Roadmap project. By correlating transcriptome profiles to epigenome profiles across diverse cell types, we aim to address a series of important questions regarding epigenetic regulation of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA splicing. In three aims, we will investigate epigenome-splicing correlation in diverse tissues and cell types (Aim 1), identify combinatorial chromatin states and long-range interactions associated with splicing (Aim 2), and elucidate how epigenetic determinants affect chromatin-associated splicing (Aim 3). The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of splicing regulation, and how epigenetic signals influence alternative splicing in normal and diseased cells. In addition, through the proposed work we will develop novel computational methods for linking epigenome signatures to RNA splicing patterns. We anticipate that these tools will be of broad interest and utility to researchers studying epigenome and transcriptome regulation in diverse biological systems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many human diseases are caused by aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. This project will use extensive epigenome and transcriptome profiles from the Epigenome Roadmap project to elucidate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions.

"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.                ",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,8847548,R01GM113708,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Shapes', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'comparison group', 'differential expression', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research study', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,283300,0.03513047945881426
"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed Center for the Ribonomics of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop gene regulatory network (GRN) models that predict which of many alternative mRNA isoforms are actually expressed and at what level.

"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.            ",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,8979977,R01HL126947,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Decitabine', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distal', 'Drug resistance', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hypermethylation', 'Ineffective Hematopoiesis', 'Introns', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'PPBP gene', 'Pancytopenia', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Specimen', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'cytopenia', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'in vivo', 'methylation biomarker', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,404125,0.037175487234866876
"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD. There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations.

"Informatics Platform for Mammalian Gene Regulation at Isoform-level DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated. The novel bioinformatics methods developed by this project will help in silico discovery and research for accelerating the linkage of phenotypic and genomic information, at gene-isoform level. Public health relevance statement:  The disruption of numerous human genes and their isoforms driven by alternative splicing and alternative transcription is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. The development of bioinformatics methods and user-friendly  software in this study will provide useful tools to better understand gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, and more importantly, how dis-regulation of these mechanisms leads to a variety of diseases.",Informatics Platform for Mammalian Gene Regulation at Isoform-level,8843951,R01LM011297,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Arts', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Fertility', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'TP53 gene', 'TP73 gene', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Trees', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer initiation', 'cost', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuropsychiatry', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web-accessible']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,337196,0.025605979884256225
"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells.

"CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop novel computational methods to identify regulatory elements in repetitive regions of the genomes using publicly available data from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE. Half of the human genome is derived from transposable elements (TEs). These highly repetitive elements were recently shown to harbor transcription factor (TF) binding sites and epigenetic regulatory signals. TEs have shaped gene regulatory networks during evolution and are dysregulated in many diseases. However, the extent to which TEs contribute to regulatory networks, and how TE sequences evolved from parasitic DNA to functional elements, remains unclear. In this proposal, we introduce a computational framework to identify TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers and to estimate the evolutionary impact of TEs to cell type-specific gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to develop an epigenomics-based approach to detect TE-derived enhancers and their target genes. Extending our recent success in developing machine learning methods to integrate DNA methylation data, we will bring to bear computational models that allow us to predict TE-derived enhancers. If successful, not only will we produce the largest catalog of TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers, but also have created a robust framework for detecting the contributions of TEs to gene regulation in any cell type or tissue. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop a TE epigenetic association assay. By taking advantage of the multi-copy nature of TE sequences, we will identify TE sequence variations or features that associate with specific epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will reconstruct sequences of the evolutionary intermediates of candidate TEs and estimate their epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will address questions including whether particular classes of TEs gained TF-binding sites and then spread quickly, or whether TEs first spread and later gained TF binding sites. If successful, we will develop an understanding of what sequence features drive the functional potential of TEs, and the modes of evolution followed by different TEs during regulatory network evolution. Such an understanding will dramatically improve our picture of regulatory network evolution by including the effects of TEs, a major class of fast evolving regulatory sequences that have been largely ignored in functional genomics studies. In Specific Aim 3 we will create a public resource based on our newly invented Repeat Element Browser to allow investigators to display, analyze, compare, and integrate Roadmap/ENCODE data and their own data on TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of data produced by consortia such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and TCGA, which currently discard most TE derived sequences. Such improvement will in turn accelerate research into understanding the impact of TEs on normal gene regulation and in human diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transposable elements (TEs) are a special class of DNA sequences which copy themselves and ""hop"" to many different locations in the genome. TEs are often referred to as ""junk"" DNA or ""parasitic"" DNA, but they are more and more implicated in genome evolution, gene regulation and diseases. These elements comprise a huge fraction of the DNA in mammalian genomes, including 50% of the human genome. Because of their repetitive nature they are generally discarded in most genomics studies. We recently showed that these elements often carry regulatory sequences that are co-opted by host genomes to perform normal gene regulation. Here we propose to study the extent to which TEs contribute to normal gene regulation throughout the genome and how mis-regulation of TE derived sequences contributes to disease.            ",CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS,8815597,R01ES024992,"['Address', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Junk DNA', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mammalian genome', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,189100,0.009343527565654304
"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY  Abstract The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013). This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics.

During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies. The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project.  Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data.

"An Integrative Approach to Construct a Regulatory Network Effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD). We will develop a novel algorithm to predict promoter-enhancer long-range interactions using the glbal run-on sequencing (GROseq) data and construct regulatory network using the known transcription factor binding sites. The analysis using the TF-gene networks will elucidate the transcriptional regulations of TZDs, which will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders.            ",An Integrative Approach to Construct a Regulatory Network Effected by TDZs,8640941,R21DK098769,"['2,4-thiazolidinedione', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brown Fat', 'Burn injury', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Calories', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Heating', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Obesity', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention approach', 'Property', 'RNA', 'RXR', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'adipokines', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cofactor', 'design', 'epigenome', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insulin sensitivity', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2014,200000,0.04066605196370764
"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs. Our models will serve as a resource to provide comprehensive context-specific regulatory annotations for disease-associated gene sets and co-expression modules.            ",Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation,8815902,R01ES025009,"['Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Indium', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Play', 'Process', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,318763,0.03352433873798188
"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Epigenomic control of RNA splicing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this project is to elucidate the roles of epigenetics and chromatin states in RNA splicing regulation. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and as a consequence exceedingly complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in creating this regulatory diversity by generating multiple RNA isoforms from a single gene. Traditionally, splicing was considered as a ""post-transcriptional"" process, and studies of splicing regulation have largely focused on the roles of cis splicing regulatory elements and their interactions with canonical RNA-binding splicing factors. However, recent studies of eukaryotic epigenomes and transcriptomes have revealed a surprisingly complex picture of splicing regulation shaped by chromatin states and epigenetic marks. Exons are characterized by increased levels of nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and certain histone modifications. Many introns are spliced co-transcriptionally when the nascent RNAs are tethered to the chromatin, and changes in the transcription elongation rate or epigenetic marks can influence exon splicing patterns. Despite these exciting findings, many questions about epigenetic regulation of splicing remain unresolved. We propose to systematically investigate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing, by taking advantage of the broad and deep epigenome and transcriptome data generated by the Epigenome Roadmap project. By correlating transcriptome profiles to epigenome profiles across diverse cell types, we aim to address a series of important questions regarding epigenetic regulation of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA splicing. In three aims, we will investigate epigenome-splicing correlation in diverse tissues and cell types (Aim 1), identify combinatorial chromatin states and long-range interactions associated with splicing (Aim 2), and elucidate how epigenetic determinants affect chromatin-associated splicing (Aim 3). The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of splicing regulation, and how epigenetic signals influence alternative splicing in normal and diseased cells. In addition, through the proposed work we will develop novel computational methods for linking epigenome signatures to RNA splicing patterns. We anticipate that these tools will be of broad interest and utility to researchers studying epigenome and transcriptome regulation in diverse biological systems.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many human diseases are caused by aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. This project will use extensive epigenome and transcriptome profiles from the Epigenome Roadmap project to elucidate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes will be determined. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The epimutations are anticipated to promote genetic alterations to contribute to the transgenerational disease phenotype.

"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease. In this project, we develop computational methods to exploit multiple sources of large-scale genomics data enabled by next-generation sequencing technology in order to provide new tools for studying gene regulation in mammalian cells.",Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs,8628862,R01HG006798,"['Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Study', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'method development', 'mouse genome', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'preference', 'programs', 'promoter', 'repository', 'role model', 'sequence learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2014,520701,0.044869227974271536
"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.            ",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,8759963,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,343125,0.0823599257883916

"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.          Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response. To tackle these complex data types, we develop novel machine learning, network analysis, and database methods. Our personalized medicine approach will help researchers study and evaluate neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"Informatics platform for mammalian gene regulation at isoform-level     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated.

"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster. This fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The proposed research will explicate the function and interconnection of animal genes and lead to a better understanding of human diseases.",Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis,8502758,R01LM010730,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'comparative', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'spatiotemporal', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vision development']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2013,291834,0.04046208605332301
"A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation of gene expression through variation in DNA methylation plays a critical role in a range of biological processes including cellular differentiation, human disease and cancer. New methods for determining the fine structure of methylation patterns genome-wide have led to an explosion of research in this field. Methylation near the gene promoter is correlated with gene silencing, while unmethylated promoters are potentially active. Current computational methods classify genes as either methylated and silenced or unmethylated and potentially active based on a coarse calculation of CpG methylation state across a window of a few hundred base pairs around the transcription start site. The detailed spatial pattern of methylation across the promoter may be an important determinant of gene expression, but current computational methods ignore this valuable information. Recent work has found regions proximal to CpG island promoters, dubbed ""CpG island shores"", whose methylation state correlates with transcription. CpG island shores are loosely defined, however, and this concept is difficult to apply in practice. While other methylation signatures are also likely to correlate with gene expression, a general framework to identify and study them has not been established. New computational tools for identification and correlation of detailed methylation patterns with gene expression are critical for advancing our understanding of the epigenetics of gene regulation. We propose to develop software tools to detect new methylation signatures at gene promoters that correlate with expression. This will be done within a formal framework so that these signatures can be used to determine differentially methylated genes in a variety of study designs. Taking advantage of the fact  that methylation over short ranges are highly correlated, we will interpolate methylation data at individual  CpG sites in a 10 kb window around the TSS to yield a methylation signature at each promoter that is  independent of primary sequence features. We will then use a metric from topology, the discrete Frechet distance, to calculate the similarity between methylation signatures, and apply this metric to cluster signatures of similar type. We will then determine clusters with methylation signatures that correlate with expression.  Clusters that contain both silenced and expressed genes will be examined to see if other local primary sequence features can be used to discriminate the genes based on expression. This approach will be used to detect methylation changes in case-control studies and in pairwise comparisons, such as needed for timecourse analysis or for the detection of different states of differentiation. The general framework developed here can be expanded in the future to examine methylation signatures at enhancers and gene bodies, as well as to histone marks or other genomic signals that carry detailed spatial information.          Narrative  DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, is an important  epigenetic regulator of gene expression in cells. DNA methylation has been implicated in a large number of  biological processes including cellular differentiation and cancer. We will develop software tools to analyze  data from new techniques for mapping DNA methylation genome-wide to discover new methylation signatures  that are associated with silenced and active genes. These will include tools to use these signatures to  determine what genes are differentially regulated in different cell types and in human disease.",A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS,8500440,R21LM011199,"['Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological Process', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG Islands', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Histones', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Metric', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'methyl group', 'promoter', 'research study', 'software development', 'spatial neglect', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,135645,0.07721065648723893
"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells. The efficacy and biocompatibility (toxicity) of polymers and combination treatments will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo (in mice).

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"An integrative approach to construct a regulatory network effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD). We will develop a novel algorithm to predict promoter-enhancer long-range interactions using the glbal run-on sequencing (GROseq) data and construct regulatory network using the known transcription factor binding sites. The analysis using the TF-gene networks will elucidate the transcriptional regulations of TZDs, which will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders.            ",An integrative approach to construct a regulatory network effected by TDZs,8491522,R21DK098769,"['2,4-thiazolidinedione', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brown Fat', 'Burn injury', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Calories', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Heating', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Obesity', 'Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention approach', 'Property', 'RNA', 'RXR', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiazolidinediones', 'Time', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'adipokines', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cofactor', 'design', 'epigenome', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insulin sensitivity', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2013,240000,0.04066605196370764
"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at  risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential  biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,8459567,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,287765,0.054126991802236055
"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.        We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions. Public availability of our system will advance genome-level understanding of human biology and facilitate development of novel drugs, therapies, and personalized medical treatments.

"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease. In this project, we develop computational methods to exploit multiple sources of large-scale genomics data enabled by next-generation sequencing technology in order to provide new tools for studying gene regulation in mammalian cells.",Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs,8463019,R01HG006798,"['Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Study', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'method development', 'mouse genome', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'preference', 'programs', 'promoter', 'repository', 'role model', 'sequence learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2013,493524,0.044869227974271536
"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.

"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.          Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response. To tackle these complex data types, we develop novel machine learning, network analysis, and database methods. Our personalized medicine approach will help researchers study and evaluate neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations.

"Informatics platform for mammalian gene regulation at isoform-level     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated.

"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster. This fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals.

"A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation of gene expression through variation in DNA methylation plays a critical role in a range of biological processes including cellular differentiation, human disease and cancer. New methods for determining the fine structure of methylation patterns genome-wide have led to an explosion of research in this field. Methylation near the gene promoter is correlated with gene silencing, while unmethylated promoters are potentially active. Current computational methods classify genes as either methylated and silenced or unmethylated and potentially active based on a coarse calculation of CpG methylation state across a window of a few hundred base pairs around the transcription start site. The detailed spatial pattern of methylation across the promoter may be an important determinant of gene expression, but current computational methods ignore this valuable information. Recent work has found regions proximal to CpG island promoters, dubbed ""CpG island shores"", whose methylation state correlates with transcription. CpG island shores are loosely defined, however, and this concept is difficult to apply in practice. While other methylation signatures are also likely to correlate with gene expression, a general framework to identify and study them has not been established. New computational tools for identification and correlation of detailed methylation patterns with gene expression are critical for advancing our understanding of the epigenetics of gene regulation. We propose to develop software tools to detect new methylation signatures at gene promoters that correlate with expression. This will be done within a formal framework so that these signatures can be used to determine differentially methylated genes in a variety of study designs. Taking advantage of the fact  that methylation over short ranges are highly correlated, we will interpolate methylation data at individual  CpG sites in a 10 kb window around the TSS to yield a methylation signature at each promoter that is  independent of primary sequence features. We will then use a metric from topology, the discrete Frechet distance, to calculate the similarity between methylation signatures, and apply this metric to cluster signatures of similar type. We will then determine clusters with methylation signatures that correlate with expression.  Clusters that contain both silenced and expressed genes will be examined to see if other local primary sequence features can be used to discriminate the genes based on expression. This approach will be used to detect methylation changes in case-control studies and in pairwise comparisons, such as needed for timecourse analysis or for the detection of different states of differentiation. The general framework developed here can be expanded in the future to examine methylation signatures at enhancers and gene bodies, as well as to histone marks or other genomic signals that carry detailed spatial information.          Narrative  DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, is an important  epigenetic regulator of gene expression in cells. DNA methylation has been implicated in a large number of  biological processes including cellular differentiation and cancer. We will develop software tools to analyze  data from new techniques for mapping DNA methylation genome-wide to discover new methylation signatures  that are associated with silenced and active genes. These will include tools to use these signatures to  determine what genes are differentially regulated in different cell types and in human disease.",A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS,8229567,R21LM011199,"['Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological Process', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG Islands', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Histones', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Metric', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'methyl group', 'promoter', 'research study', 'software development', 'spatial neglect', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2012,152000,0.07721065648723893
"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition. Project Narrative  The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy). Moreover, the systems biology approach and the tools that will be developed in this project can be applied to any species for which genome data is available, which will enable researchers to model and manipulate a broad spectrum of regulatory circuits in biology with potential medical and pharmaceutical applications.",Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome,8309335,F32GM095273,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Arabidopsis', 'Assimilations', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fertilizers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Glutamine', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrogen', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-DNA', 'TF gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Water Pollution', 'base', 'genome-wide', 'ground water', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'network models', 'nutrition', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2012,53942,0.009327809051834295
"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at  risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential  biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,8246510,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,306133,0.054126991802236055
"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Computational methods for the analysis of RNA-Seq data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technologies for the measurement of mRNA quantities within cells are key components of a biomedical researcher<s toolbox. The characterization of gene expression is important to both the understanding of the molecular biology of the cell and the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. To be most useful to scientists, RNA measurement technologies should be as accurate and precise as possible since even small perturbations in transcript levels may be significant. A recently developed experimental method, RNA-Seq, is promising to revolutionize gene expression analysis and is enabling new discoveries about the human transcriptome. RNA-Seq data demands a significant amount of computation before it can be used and the current computational methods are still in their infancy. We propose to take RNA-Seq computational methods to the next level, increasing both the accuracy of gene expression estimates and the number of scenarios in which it may be used. Using novel probabilistic models and statistical learning techniques, we will enable the technology to precisely measure alternative splicing events and characterize the transcriptomes of non-model organisms. Our computational methods will be validated with both real and simulated RNA-Seq data and will be made freely available as an open source software package. In addition, we will use the methods we develop to explore differences between the transcriptomes of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. A first application will be the characterization of alternative splicing differences between human embryonic stem cells and differentiated fibroblast cells. A second application will be the estimation of gene expression levels in embryos of the frog Xenopus leaves using the genome sequence of a closely related frog; Xenopus (Silurana) tropical is as a reference. The results of these experiments are expected to advance our understanding of cellular differentiation in vertebrates and, ultimately, the potential for stem cells to be used in the treatment of human diseases and injuries.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.        We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions. Public availability of our system will advance genome-level understanding of human biology and facilitate development of novel drugs, therapies, and personalized medical treatments.

"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level.

We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.

"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease. In this project, we develop computational methods to exploit multiple sources of large-scale genomics data enabled by next-generation sequencing technology in order to provide new tools for studying gene regulation in mammalian cells.",Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs,8311335,R01HG006798,"['Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Study', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'RNA', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'epigenomics', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'method development', 'mouse genome', 'multitask', 'next generation', 'preference', 'programs', 'promoter', 'repository', 'role model', 'sequence learning', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2012,556291,0.044869227974271536
"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health. n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,8197396,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2012,306196,0.03971614098325782
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach Project Summary/Abstract We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semi- systematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The interplay between the gene expression machinery and the compaction of genetic material into chromatin is now recognized as highly dynamic and complex. These processes must be tightly controlled for normal cellular physiology and to prevent disease states such as cancer. We will use a systems approach to genetically dissect the structural and functional relationships between the highly conserved components of these pathways in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, in order to more easily understand and eventually manipulate the vast complexity of human cells. n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8258763,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histone H4', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'prevent', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2012,438425,0.028258783586992523
"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster. This fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control.

"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy). Moreover, the systems biology approach and the tools that will be developed in this project can be applied to any species for which genome data is available, which will enable researchers to model and manipulate a broad spectrum of regulatory circuits in biology with potential medical and pharmaceutical applications.          Project Narrative  The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and  predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Rewiring the yeast brain:  Redundancy and interference in genetic networks    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)   Abstract: Similar to neural networks in animals, molecular networks in cells can generate bistable or oscillatory dynamics that maintain memories of previous events (e.g. epigenetic switch) or order periodic events (e.g. cell cycle), respectively. In cells, networks of genes interacting with one another through regulatory feedback implement such dynamics. Analogous to learning in brains, cells can """"learn"""" correlations in their environmental signals by encoding such correlations into their gene network dynamics through mutation, a """"re-wiring"""" process that occurs on the timescale of generations. The issue of learning the statistical regularities and correlations of environmental signals is best exemplified by the evolution of """"circadian clocks"""", which are oscillatory gene circuits that have learned to internalize the 24-hour light-dark circadian cycle. Strikingly, circadian clocks have evolved independently multiple times, which suggests there exists some selection pressure and/or evolutionary mechanism that repeatedly favor the convergent evolution of autonomous oscillation. The hypothesis of my research proposal is that certain types of loss-of-function mutations in duplicated genes (known as dominant-negative mutations) can easily generate bistability and oscillation in existing regulatory networks. Gene duplication followed by a loss-of-function mutation can generate a dominant-negative. A dominant negative mutation is a partial loss-of-function mutation that renders a gene duplicate functionally inactive, yet still capable of interacting with the original duplicate, the upstream effectors, and/or downstream targets. Thus, dominant-negatives can easily interfere with the proper regulation and activity of the original duplicate. Because both gene duplication and loss-of-function mutations occur frequently in evolution, this presents an evolutionary mechanism for rapidly generating bistability and autonomous oscillation in gene regulatory networks. My proposed research over the next five years will integrate experiment and theory to understand the extent to which gene duplication and dominant-negative mutations facilitate the evolution of epigenetic switches and circadian clocks in regulatory networks. We will use computer simulation and an experimental directed evolution approach in a tractable, model eukaryote (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to test the ability of cells to learn the statistical regularities of their coupled environmental signals. Understanding how and why single-cell microbes and parasites have learned to predict their environment is essential for understanding their future evolution to changing host conditions.   Public Health Relevance: The ability of parasites to learn and adapt to changing host conditions and environments presents a challenge to human health. The objective of my research proposal is to understand the capacity of gene networks in single cells to learn and predict the statistical regularities of their environment. Discovering the limitations and abilities of parasites to evolve and anticipate changes in their host environment will be invaluable for the treatment of many human diseases.       n/a",Rewiring the yeast brain:  Redundancy and interference in genetic networks,8146626,DP2OD008654,"['Animals', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Dominant-Negative Mutation', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Parasites', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Yeasts', 'abstracting', 'brain cell', 'circadian pacemaker', 'directed evolution', 'duplicate genes', 'human disease', 'loss of function mutation', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'theories']",OD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DP2,2011,2355000,0.0004961554214099205
"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types. This project will create a computational framework and resource to integrate large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets, to understand their functional role in health and disease, and to understand their dynamics across different cell lines and disease states. The knowledge gained can play key roles in understanding the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during healthy development, and how dysregulation of these processes can lead to the onset of disease.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.            The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology.

"Computational methods for the analysis of RNA-Seq data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technologies for the measurement of mRNA quantities within cells are key components of a biomedical researcher<s toolbox. The characterization of gene expression is important to both the understanding of the molecular biology of the cell and the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. To be most useful to scientists, RNA measurement technologies should be as accurate and precise as possible since even small perturbations in transcript levels may be significant. A recently developed experimental method, RNA-Seq, is promising to revolutionize gene expression analysis and is enabling new discoveries about the human transcriptome. RNA-Seq data demands a significant amount of computation before it can be used and the current computational methods are still in their infancy. We propose to take RNA-Seq computational methods to the next level, increasing both the accuracy of gene expression estimates and the number of scenarios in which it may be used. Using novel probabilistic models and statistical learning techniques, we will enable the technology to precisely measure alternative splicing events and characterize the transcriptomes of non-model organisms. Our computational methods will be validated with both real and simulated RNA-Seq data and will be made freely available as an open source software package. In addition, we will use the methods we develop to explore differences between the transcriptomes of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. A first application will be the characterization of alternative splicing differences between human embryonic stem cells and differentiated fibroblast cells. A second application will be the estimation of gene expression levels in embryos of the frog Xenopus leaves using the genome sequence of a closely related frog; Xenopus (Silurana) tropical is as a reference. The results of these experiments are expected to advance our understanding of cellular differentiation in vertebrates and, ultimately, the potential for stem cells to be used in the treatment of human diseases and injuries.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to develop computational methods for the support of a technology that measures the quantities of RNA inside of a cell.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data.

"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.

"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8063104,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histone H4', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2011,460136,0.022161300396871773
"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.            There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed.

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats. The openness of RegulonDB data and internal structure will expand considerably, enhancing as well its availability to tools for analysis and representation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RegulonDB is a gold standard both in its conceptual and computational design, as well as in the amount and quality of data gathered on the largest and best characterized regulatory network of a single organism. The improvements and expansion of RegulonDB may accelerate research in other bacterial models, including pathogens. RegulonDB has served as a benchmark for a variety of computational predictive tools for components of the network.

"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases. The proposed research will lead to the development of a novel computational tool to discover enhancer elements using genome-wide chromatin signatures. Successful completion of the project will also uncover novel enhancers in two biomedically important cell types, embryonic stem cell and T lymphocyte, which could generate new insights into the regulatory networks controlling stem cell phenotype and T cell development and activation.              Narrative: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks. We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process. But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment scheme.",Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin,7865088,R01GM093156,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Heel', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune response', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Problem Formulations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell behavior', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'design', 'driving force', 'environmental change', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'grasp', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'software systems', 'sound', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,460864,0.021527516598985757
"Computational methods for the analysis of RNA-Seq data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technologies for the measurement of mRNA quantities within cells are key components of a biomedical researcher<s toolbox. The characterization of gene expression is important to both the understanding of the molecular biology of the cell and the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. To be most useful to scientists, RNA measurement technologies should be as accurate and precise as possible since even small perturbations in transcript levels may be significant. A recently developed experimental method, RNA-Seq, is promising to revolutionize gene expression analysis and is enabling new discoveries about the human transcriptome. RNA-Seq data demands a significant amount of computation before it can be used and the current computational methods are still in their infancy. We propose to take RNA-Seq computational methods to the next level, increasing both the accuracy of gene expression estimates and the number of scenarios in which it may be used. Using novel probabilistic models and statistical learning techniques, we will enable the technology to precisely measure alternative splicing events and characterize the transcriptomes of non-model organisms. Our computational methods will be validated with both real and simulated RNA-Seq data and will be made freely available as an open source software package. In addition, we will use the methods we develop to explore differences between the transcriptomes of undifferentiated and differentiated cells.

"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.

The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.          n/a",Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues,7810646,R01GM084089,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Microarray Chip', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Introns', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Poly A', 'Polyadenylation', 'Polyadenylation Pathway', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'human disease', 'improved', 'preference', 'research study', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MED/DENT OF NJ-NJ MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2010,301158,0.013672246477649154
"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7810583,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,467448,0.022161300396871773
"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,7713981,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bite', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2010,319254,0.03952709645205748
"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats. The openness of RegulonDB data and internal structure will expand considerably, enhancing as well its availability to tools for analysis and representation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RegulonDB is a gold standard both in its conceptual and computational design, as well as in the amount and quality of data gathered on the largest and best characterized regulatory network of a single organism. The improvements and expansion of RegulonDB may accelerate research in other bacterial models, including pathogens. RegulonDB has served as a benchmark for a variety of computational predictive tools for components of the network.

"Transcriptional co-regulators in epidermis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The stratified mammalian epidermis develops from somatic ectoderm by the progressive addition and differentiation of superficial epidermal layers (1). After the initial morphogenesis, the epidermis is maintained by homeostatic mechanisms whereby keratinocytes move from the proliferating basal cell layer towards the surface as they undergo a series of differentiation steps, ultimately undergoing cell death. One role of keratinocyte differentiation is the formation of an effective permeability barrier, which depends on the regulated expression of a large battery of genes encoding components of the cornified and granular layers (2). Under funding by the parent grant, we are using molecular biology to investigate the role of a single transcription factor, the Grainyhead-like transcription factor Get1/Grhl3 (3-5), in epidermal differentiation. In contrast, in this revision application, we propose a systems biology approach to computationally generate transcriptional regulatory network for the process of epidermal differentiation. Thus, this application leads to a new direction and differs from the parent grant in two important ways: First, it expands the scope of the study to transcriptional regulatory networks in epidermal development in general, and second, it incorporates the methods of systems biology; thus the application is consistent with one of the key emphasis areas of this RFA (Developmental Biology - Systems biology). The specific goals are to: 1) Generate global gene expression data over the time course of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation; and 2) Use the time course gene expression data from 1, other genome-wide expression data, DNA motif information, functional annotation, and literature mining to infer transcriptional networks in epidermal differentiation. The goal of this project is also to build a new interdisciplinary team between the Andersen laboratory, whose primary expertise is in molecular/developmental biology, and Alex Ihler, a new assistant professor whose primary expertise is in graphical models, Bayesian inference methods, machine learning, and data mining. The contributions of the Ihler group -- the mathematical modeling required to define the networks -- will allow approaches and advances in our understanding of epidermal differentiation that would not be attainable without this collaboration.               Defective epidermal differentiation and disrupted barrier formation are salient features of several skin diseases, including childhood eczema and psoriasis.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,7742918,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Fibrinogen', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,329351,0.05039728743381884
"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types.

"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes.

"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances.

"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,7507028,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bite', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2009,322622,0.03952709645205748
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7629191,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,448088,0.022161300396871773
"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues.

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats. The openness of RegulonDB data and internal structure will expand considerably, enhancing as well its availability to tools for analysis and representation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RegulonDB is a gold standard both in its conceptual and computational design, as well as in the amount and quality of data gathered on the largest and best characterized regulatory network of a single organism. The improvements and expansion of RegulonDB may accelerate research in other bacterial models, including pathogens. RegulonDB has served as a benchmark for a variety of computational predictive tools for components of the network. Furthermore, E.coli is at the forefront in systems biology as a proof-of-concept biological model to develop new methodologies in bioinformatics, representation and simulation, to overcome challenges in order to model and understand the functioning of a whole cell.          n/a",Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling,7683918,R01GM071962,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Biotechnology', 'Boston', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Mappings', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Research', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sigma Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Text', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transduction Gene', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'data exchange', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'mutant', 'natural language', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2009,400507,0.030449574628697032
"Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity The focus of the proposed research is to understand the effect of sequence variation on the function of molecular networks. We will develop computational algorithms that integrate genotype, gene expression and phenotype data to construct models that describe how sequence variation perturbs the regulatory network, alters signal processing and is manifested in cellular phenotypes. Our approach is based on Bayesian networks, a framework we pioneered for the reconstruction of molecular networks from high-throughput data. We recently applied this framework to develop the Geronemo algorithm which we applied to yeast and uncovered a novel relationship between the sequence specific RNA factor PUF3 and P-Bodies, as well as a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in MKT1 that modulates this relationship. Both novel findings were experimentally validated subsequent to their discovery. Our approach is based on the complementary duality between genetic sequence and functional genomics. A significant influence of genotype on phenotype is induced by fine tuned perturbations to the complex regulatory network that governs a cell's activity. Variation in the expression of a single gene is more tractable and can be used as an intermediary to help associate genetic factors to the more complex downstream changes in phenotype in a hierarchical fashion. Conversely, DNA sequence polymorphisms are effective perturb-agens which provide a rich source of variation to help uncover regulatory relations in the molecular network as well as direct their causality. We will develop our methods using a large collection of highly variable yeast strains, for which we have generated robust quantitative growth curves under numerous environmental conditions. The methodologies piloted in yeast will be extended to genotype and gene expression data derived from tumor samples to attempt to elucidate the multiple genetic factors that drive their proliferation. These tools will be made publicly available, including a friendly graphical user interface and visualization. n/a",Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity,7937675,DP2OD002414,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Arginine', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carbon', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Double Effect', 'Drops', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Genetics', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Figs -

"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer. Understanding how a factor targets genes is crucial for discovering the pathways whose malfunction leads to the symptoms. This is an achievable goal, given the right way to analyze the plethora of genome-wide data available to us.           n/a",Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes,7392219,R01HG003470,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Class', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mating Types', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulon', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Score', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shock', 'Sigma Factor', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Galactosidase', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'programs', 'promoter', 'research study', 'response', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2008,294338,0.023179480793516175
"Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarray technology enables investigators to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes and holds the promise to cast new light onto the regulatory mechanisms of the genome. A main avenue of experimental investigation, leveraging on this technology, is based on the temporal dissection of cellular mechanisms. Temporal experiments offer the possibility of observing these mechanisms in action and to break down the genome into sets of genes involved in the same processes. The overall goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised approach and an integrated software environment to automatically discover regulatory mechanisms from temporal microarray experiments. The hypothesis underpinning our approach is that complex interaction patterns can be identified through analysis of conditional rather than marginal gene expression profiles. This novel approach also provides principled guidance to experimental design and sampling strategies, and it naturally extends to a large class of statistical models, able to capture a wider range of dynamic behaviors and experimental designs. We plan to develop a comprehensive framework to design and analyze microarray data collected through temporal experiments. This framework will be used to specify and answer the critical design questions of sample size and sampling frequency determination. Using this framework, we will develop a new model-based approach and an iterative search algorithm, called Conditional Clustering, to identify different patterns of behavior determined by a set of genes through the analysis of the behavior of a gene given a set of other genes, rather than the behavior of each gene in isolation. We will implement this design and analysis framework in a computer program that will be distributed over the Internet.This project brings together researchers in artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics and experimental design with a long track record of methodological contributions to bioinformatics to develop a novel methodological approach to a critical question at the forefront of genomic research.         n/a",Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics,7350919,R01HG003354,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Class', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Today', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'computer program', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'size', 'software development', 'statistics']",NHGRI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2008,298801,0.01348273275906918
"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7445536,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,467804,0.022161300396871773
"A Gene Expression Based Blood Test for Rheumatic Disease Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Clinical dilemma: Recent advances in biologic therapies for rheumatic diseases provide a means for more profound disease management. Proper diagnosis is a necessary aspect of choosing the proper biologic therapy. While disease diagnosis, based on clinical findings and laboratory tests, is effective in a significant number of patients, it can be problematic in patients with early disease, mild symptoms, or unclear presentation, leading to delayed or inappropriate treatment with poor patient outcomes and/or exposures to unnecessary drug toxicities. This problem is due in part to limitations of specificity and sensitivity of current rheumatology diagnostic laboratory tests. Many of these tests are designed to include or rule out one disease, which may be inadequate to obtain a diagnosis if the results are negative. Our preliminary data suggest that a single blood test can be developed which is capable of sensitive and specific disease diagnosis of many common rheumatic diseases using gene expression profiling of peripheral blood. We also have data suggesting that this multi-disease test is effective in patients with early disease prior to full clinical differentiation and may aid in guiding earlier treatment which can dramatically improve outcomes.   Approach: To assess the potential of gene expression-based diagnostic testing, clinical samples were collected from a cohort of patients with definitive forms of inflammatory disease, and broad-based gene expression profiling was performed. Multivariate algorithms identified 38 genes that distinguished controls and the four inflammatory diseases tested with high specificity and sensitivity. We have subsequently collected RNA from a second larger patient cohort with sufficient size to power a study to distinguish among a set of rheumatic diseases that can be difficult to distinguish, namely rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ankylosing spondylitis. Biostatistical analyses of gene expression profiles will allow us to translate these findings into two high throughput clinical tests, the first based on gene expression results and the second based on serum protein biomarkers. Finally, we will assess the prognostic power of gene expression profiling by examining results from patients early in their disease cycle with undifferentiated arthritis to determine who is likely to develop erosive disease and who is likely to go into remission. These findings will allow physicians to use more proactive forms of therapy in early undifferentiated arthritis to delay onset of erosive disease and to use less expensive drugs with fewer side effects for patients that are likely to remit.

"Gene Regulation E. coli Database Integrated Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Center for Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca and a group of collaborators propose to further develop and enrich the RegulonDB database. RegulonDB contains the largest electronically-available regulatory network of any living organism, that of Escherichia coli K-12. In the project we will expand the design, implement computational and conceptual models, and generate annotations derived from original literature of the different components of the regulatory network. We will experimentally map promoters and transcription units under different conditions. This project expands a previous grant supporting RegulonDB. High quality manual curation is to be enriched beyond transcription initiation to include signal-transduction connecting sensing with regulation, as well as with natural language text processing tools. We propose to continue an exhaustive experimental mapping of all possible transcription initiation sites in the genome and to perform an exhaustive experimental identification of transcription units in different conditions. The core of RegulonDB (literature-based network and the graphic and browsing tools) will be linked and made accessible, as optional user selections, with high-throughput available experiments (microarrays and ChIP- chip) both as raw and pre-analyzed data, as well as with collections of computational predictions of all network elements (transcription factors, promoters, binding sites, operons, regulatory interactions). This will be based on track representations and compliant with international consortia normalized pathway exchange formats. The openness of RegulonDB data and internal structure will expand considerably, enhancing as well its availability to tools for analysis and representation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RegulonDB is a gold standard both in its conceptual and computational design, as well as in the amount and quality of data gathered on the largest and best characterized regulatory network of a single organism. The improvements and expansion of RegulonDB may accelerate research in other bacterial models, including pathogens. RegulonDB has served as a benchmark for a variety of computational predictive tools for components of the network.

"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer.

"Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarray technology enables investigators to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes and holds the promise to cast new light onto the regulatory mechanisms of the genome. A main avenue of experimental investigation, leveraging on this technology, is based on the temporal dissection of cellular mechanisms. Temporal experiments offer the possibility of observing these mechanisms in action and to break down the genome into sets of genes involved in the same processes. The overall goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised approach and an integrated software environment to automatically discover regulatory mechanisms from temporal microarray experiments. The hypothesis underpinning our approach is that complex interaction patterns can be identified through analysis of conditional rather than marginal gene expression profiles. This novel approach also provides principled guidance to experimental design and sampling strategies, and it naturally extends to a large class of statistical models, able to capture a wider range of dynamic behaviors and experimental designs. We plan to develop a comprehensive framework to design and analyze microarray data collected through temporal experiments. This framework will be used to specify and answer the critical design questions of sample size and sampling frequency determination. Using this framework, we will develop a new model-based approach and an iterative search algorithm, called Conditional Clustering, to identify different patterns of behavior determined by a set of genes through the analysis of the behavior of a gene given a set of other genes, rather than the behavior of each gene in isolation. We will implement this design and analysis framework in a computer program that will be distributed over the Internet.This project brings together researchers in artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics and experimental design with a long track record of methodological contributions to bioinformatics to develop a novel methodological approach to a critical question at the forefront of genomic research.         n/a",Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics,7176152,R01HG003354,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Class', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Today', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'computer program', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'size', 'software development', 'statistics']",NHGRI,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CORPORATION,R01,2007,305165,0.01348273275906918
"Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity The focus of the proposed research is to understand the effect of sequence variation on the function of molecular networks. We will develop computational algorithms that integrate genotype, gene expression and phenotype data to construct models that describe how sequence variation perturbs the regulatory network, alters signal processing and is manifested in cellular phenotypes. Our approach is based on Bayesian networks, a framework we pioneered for the reconstruction of molecular networks from high-throughput data. We recently applied this framework to develop the Geronemo algorithm which we applied to yeast and uncovered a novel relationship between the sequence specific RNA factor PUF3 and P-Bodies, as well as a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in MKT1 that modulates this relationship. Both novel findings were experimentally validated subsequent to their discovery. Our approach is based on the complementary duality between genetic sequence and functional genomics. A significant influence of genotype on phenotype is induced by fine tuned perturbations to the complex regulatory network that governs a cell's activity. Variation in the expression of a single gene is more tractable and can be used as an intermediary to help associate genetic factors to the more complex downstream changes in phenotype in a hierarchical fashion. Conversely, DNA sequence polymorphisms are effective perturb-agens which provide a rich source of variation to help uncover regulatory relations in the molecular network as well as direct their causality. We will develop our methods using a large collection of highly variable yeast strains, for which we have generated robust quantitative growth curves under numerous environmental conditions. The methodologies piloted in yeast will be extended to genotype and gene expression data derived from tumor samples to attempt to elucidate the multiple genetic factors that drive their proliferation. These tools will be made publicly available, including a friendly graphical user interface and visualization. n/a",Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity,7431104,DP2OD002414,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Arginine', 'Arts', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carbon', 'Categories', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Compatible', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Double Effect', 'Drops', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Genetics', 'Face', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Figs -

"Genomic Reconstruction of Yeast Transcription Networks DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organisms devote a significant fraction of their genomes to encoding regulatory information which specifies when and where different genes should be turned on or off. Such information is essential for understanding development, tissue specificity, and cellular response to the environment and has great importance for understanding the molecular basis of disease. The one dimensional regulatory programs encoded in DNA are executed by transcription factors which respond to different conditions and regulate gene expression combinatorially, leading to complex regulatory networks. The goal of the proposed research is to develop theoretical models and computational algorithms to decipher the regulatory programs and to reconstruct the transcription networks in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The following are the specific aims: 1) to systematically map the DNA recognition sites and target genes of transcription factors in the genome, 2) to identify environmental and genetic perturbations under which each transcription factor is activated or deactivated, 3) to systematically analyze combinatorial regulation by multiple transcription factors, 4) collaborate with two experimental labs to address specific problems of transcriptional regulation and combinatorial control, and 5) to build databases and online tools for the biological community to analyze gene expression data and transcriptional regulation.

"Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reverse engineering of cellular genetic circuits from gene expression data is an important and scientifically challenging problem. When applied to system more complex than a yeast cell, however, most of the approaches for reverse engineering are limited by their reliance on a significant number of ad-hoc perturbation, such as gene knockout.  We propose to address these issues and to attempt to reconstruct the genetic circuitry of human B-cells by coupling three distinct components: 1) an information theoretic method for the inference of cellular networks from microarray profile data for a large number of distinct cellular and molecular phenotypes 2) A synthetic network simulation framework for the assessment of the performance of the reverse engineering under a variety of constraints and conditions, such as noise and network complexity. 3) An adaptive learning method that will iteratively apply optimal perturbations to the biological system, which will allow refining the cellular network model over time.  Furthermore, we propose to biologically validate this approach by elucidating the cellular networks of human B lymphocytes, from a variety of normal, tumor-derived, and experimentally manipulated B cell phenotypes, which are significant both from an oncological and immunological perspective. This will be accomplished by analyzing an existing set of over 340 high-quality microarray expression profiles.  Finally, we will create a software platform to reverse engineer any biological system for which adequate microarray data is available. The platform will also allow to design and perform virtual, in-silico gene perturbation experiments. n/a",Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes,7082976,R01CA109755,"['B lymphocyte', 'artificial intelligence', 'cellular oncology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'cytogenetics', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression profiling', 'genetic models', 'human data', 'lymphoma', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular genetics', 'molecular oncology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,373483,0.010139361035323702

"Statistical Models in Epigenomics The primary objective of this proposal is to develop statistical models for the analysis of DNA methylation data. Questions that are currently posed for gene expression profiles, such as how to classify samples based on cell-wide gene expression patterns or how to classify genes with unknown function, based on their expression patterns across samples, may be similarly posed for DNA methylation patterns.  Our focus is on the discovery of new subgroups based on patterns of DNA methylation.  We view DNA methylation patterns as an intermediate variable along a pathway from exposures to outcomes and take a flexible hierarchical modeling approach that can incorporate measured and unmeasured covariates.  Our aims are motivated by ongoing and planned future studies in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Norris Cancer Center at the University of Southern California.  Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop model-based class discovery methods (cluster analysis/unsupervised learning approaches) using quantitative measures of DNA methylation, adjusting for locus-specific and sample-specific covariate effects. a. Analysis of paired samples of tumor tissue and normal tissue taken from the margin of the tumor. b. Extend model to allow for multiple tumors per subject. c. Extend model to a two-dimensional cluster analysis of samples and loci. 2. Develop models for characterizing methylation patterns as an intermediate variable by modeling a) the association between risk factors and methylation pattern clusters, and b) the association between methylation pattern clusters and outcome. 3.

"Genomic Reconstruction of Yeast Transcription Networks DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organisms devote a significant fraction of their genomes to encoding regulatory information which specifies when and where different genes should be turned on or off. Such information is essential for understanding development, tissue specificity, and cellular response to the environment and has great importance for understanding the molecular basis of disease. The one dimensional regulatory programs encoded in DNA are executed by transcription factors which respond to different conditions and regulate gene expression combinatorially, leading to complex regulatory networks. The goal of the proposed research is to develop theoretical models and computational algorithms to decipher the regulatory programs and to reconstruct the transcription networks in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The following are the specific aims: 1) to systematically map the DNA recognition sites and target genes of transcription factors in the genome, 2) to identify environmental and genetic perturbations under which each transcription factor is activated or deactivated, 3) to systematically analyze combinatorial regulation by multiple transcription factors, 4) collaborate with two experimental labs to address specific problems of transcriptional regulation and combinatorial control, and 5) to build databases and online tools for the biological community to analyze gene expression data and transcriptional regulation.

"Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reverse engineering of cellular genetic circuits from gene expression data is an important and scientifically challenging problem. When applied to system more complex than a yeast cell, however, most of the approaches for reverse engineering are limited by their reliance on a significant number of ad-hoc perturbation, such as gene knockout.  We propose to address these issues and to attempt to reconstruct the genetic circuitry of human B-cells by coupling three distinct components: 1) an information theoretic method for the inference of cellular networks from microarray profile data for a large number of distinct cellular and molecular phenotypes 2) A synthetic network simulation framework for the assessment of the performance of the reverse engineering under a variety of constraints and conditions, such as noise and network complexity. 3) An adaptive learning method that will iteratively apply optimal perturbations to the biological system, which will allow refining the cellular network model over time.  Furthermore, we propose to biologically validate this approach by elucidating the cellular networks of human B lymphocytes, from a variety of normal, tumor-derived, and experimentally manipulated B cell phenotypes, which are significant both from an oncological and immunological perspective. This will be accomplished by analyzing an existing set of over 340 high-quality microarray expression profiles.  Finally, we will create a software platform to reverse engineer any biological system for which adequate microarray data is available. The platform will also allow to design and perform virtual, in-silico gene perturbation experiments. n/a",Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes,6925178,R01CA109755,"['B lymphocyte', 'artificial intelligence', 'cellular oncology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'cytogenetics', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression profiling', 'genetic models', 'human data', 'lymphoma', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular genetics', 'molecular oncology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,387233,0.010139361035323702

"GenePattern: Methodologies and Software Tools.  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years there have been exciting breakthroughs in the application of computational methods to problems in cancer genomics. Machine learning techniques applied to gene expression data have been used to address the questions of distinguishing tumor morphology, predicting post-treatment outcome, and finding molecular markers for disease. While these studies have been very promising, significant challenges remain. Extracting biological knowledge from microarray-based gene expression data is difficult. The development of robust and accurate expression-based classifiers of biological and clinical states is similarly problematic. Biologists do not have access to an integrated set of robust, sophisticated analytical tools.  Our goal is to develop, implement, and distribute computational genomics methods that address these challenges in the gene expression profiling field.  Aim 1: Capture the behavior of a set of genes representing a pathway or state of the cell to reduce a list of thousands of expressed genes into a few hundred metagenes. Metagenes should filter the noise, technical variation, and idiosyncrasies of the data, and capture the actual molecular logic or relevant biological correlations and structure in the data.  Aim 2: Develop a robust and validated computational methodology for using metagene markers for classification.  Aim 3: Develop and distribute an integrated software package, GenePattern, to put the power of sophisticated computational methods into the hands of the biomedical research community.

"Statistical Models in Epigenomics The primary objective of this proposal is to develop statistical models for the analysis of DNA methylation data. Questions that are currently posed for gene expression profiles, such as how to classify samples based on cell-wide gene expression patterns or how to classify genes with unknown function, based on their expression patterns across samples, may be similarly posed for DNA methylation patterns.  Our focus is on the discovery of new subgroups based on patterns of DNA methylation.  We view DNA methylation patterns as an intermediate variable along a pathway from exposures to outcomes and take a flexible hierarchical modeling approach that can incorporate measured and unmeasured covariates.  Our aims are motivated by ongoing and planned future studies in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Norris Cancer Center at the University of Southern California.  Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop model-based class discovery methods (cluster analysis/unsupervised learning approaches) using quantitative measures of DNA methylation, adjusting for locus-specific and sample-specific covariate effects. a. Analysis of paired samples of tumor tissue and normal tissue taken from the margin of the tumor. b. Extend model to allow for multiple tumors per subject. c. Extend model to a two-dimensional cluster analysis of samples and loci. 2. Develop models for characterizing methylation patterns as an intermediate variable by modeling a) the association between risk factors and methylation pattern clusters, and b) the association between methylation pattern clusters and outcome. 3. Apply methods to studies of DNA methylation in colorectacl adenomas and lung cancer. n/a",Statistical Models in Epigenomics,6533439,R01CA097346,"['DNA methylation', ' adenoma', ' artificial intelligence', ' cancer risk', ' colorectal neoplasms', ' computer simulation', ' gene expression', ' human data', ' lung neoplasms', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2002,231563,0.06421388254532125

"FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPING CEREBELLUM   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Granule cell precursors of the cerebellum        undergo exuberant proliferation and subsequent differentiation during postnatal      days 1-21 (Pl-21) in the mouse. Granule cells are also thought, to give rise to      medulloblastoma, a brain tumor primarily affecting children. This proposal is        aimed at characterizing gene expression profiles during the highly                   proliferative phase of cerebellar development in the postnatal mouse. Existing       analytical methods for elucidating the functional relationships between genes        expressed in cells typically fall to account for significant sources of              variation (i.e., ""noise"") inherent in the data. This problem will only be            compounded as analysis progresses from unicellular organisms to complex tissues      such as the developing CNS. The hypothesis driving the proposed research plan        is that improved classification and clustering techniques in functional              genomics can be obtained by incorporating sources of variation/noise into the        analytic method. The proposed work will utilize a model system of the                developing mouse cerebellum, from which improved methods for the interpretation      of complex, DNA microarray-based gene expression data will be developed.                                                                                                  Aim 1 is to generate a gene expression data set (consisting of the analysis of       19,000 genes) from the newborn and neonatal mouse cerebellum at various              developmental stages (P1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, 30). Math-1 is a basic               helix-loop-helix transcription factor with essential roles in cerebellar             granule cell development. We will utilize transgenic mice in which selectable        reporter genes (e.g., jellyfish green fluorescent protein, GFP) are expressed        under control of the granule precursor cell-specific Math-1 enhancer. This will      allow for further subdivision into proliferating, immature granule cell              (Math-1-positive) and other cell types (Math-1-negative) by fluorescent cell         activated sorting (FACS). Aim 2- The time series obtained in Aim 1 will be           analyzed in both the time and frequency domain, using Fourier transforms of the      expression data. Classification and clustering techniques that fully exploit         the ""noise models"" developed in Aim 1 will be applied to these time series. In       Aim 3 we will screen candidate genes/ESTs to confirm appropriate                     spatio-temporal-specific expression in developing cerebellar granule cells from      P0-P21 using a high throughput in situ hybridization protocol. Deliverables          from the work include an open source, public domain, web-accessible tool kit of      noise-aware machine learning (classification and clustering) tools that are          anticipated to be widely applicable to the analysis of time series of gene           expression networks in complex biological systems. In addition, it is                anticipated that candidate genes with possible roles in cerebellar granule cell      proliferation, differentiation or possibly, tumorigenesis, will emerge that can      be analyzed in future hypothesis-driven projects.                                                                                                                         n/a",FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPING CEREBELLUM,6394443,R21NS041764,"['artificial intelligence', ' cerebellum', ' developmental genetics', ' developmental neurobiology', ' flow cytometry', ' functional /structural genomics', ' genetically modified animals', ' granule cell', ' green fluorescent proteins', ' in situ hybridization', ' laboratory mouse', ' neurogenetics', ' reporter genes']",NINDS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE,R21,2001,229539,0.007793548833131775

"Uncovering the epitranscriptome regulatory codes using machine learning Project Summary N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant methylation widely found in mRNAs of mammalian cells whose function is largely unknown. Recent research has accumulated increasingly strong evidence of m6A's involvement in different diseases such as leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, and AIDs. While m6A's close involvement in many diseases is apparent, mechanistic evidence linking m6A alterations to disease phenotypes is mostly missing. Most of the recent research is fueled by the high throughput sequencing technologies such as MeRIP-seq for transcriptome-wide profiling of m6A methylation. However, due to the innate limitations of such technologies, sophisticated machine learning based algorithms are urgently needed to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels and the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A. Without bridging these knowledge gaps, it is impossible to made inroads to the problem of finding m6A's role in regulating diseases. To address these issues, our aims in this proposal are 1) Establish a deep learning algorithm for base-resolution m6A site prediction; 2) Establish base- resolution m6A differential site prediction using a hierarchical Bayesian approach; and 3) Determine m6A- mediated genes and functions by Bayesian Negative-Binomial regression. The proposed research will employ deep learning and adversarial learned inference methods and utilize both methylation quantification and sequence information for the first time. Also, it will employ Bayesian graphical model-based methods for combining sequence and methylation level information. It is expected that the developed algorithms will have broad applications in functional study, for which we plan to closely work with our collaborators in applying these algorithms in their research of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which will lead to the fulfillment our long term goal in the eventual validation and practical medical application of m6A research in the future. Project Narrative  This project proposes to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels, the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A.

"Causal Effect Estimation of Regulatory Molecules Project Summary/Abstract Transcription factors and microRNAs are essential regulatory molecules (RM) that control messenger RNAs (mRNA) and are known to be dysregulated in human diseases. Each RM may affect multiple pathways of the cell which is both a blessing and a curse. If a therapy targets the proper RM, it can attack the disease from multiple fronts and increase efficacy. On the other hand, targeted therapy may result in serious adverse effects due to our limited knowledge of the downstream causal effect of RM manipulation. Although the local bindings between single RMs and their targets have been studied computationally and experimentally, the intensity of functional consequences of such bindings on the transcriptome is unclear. Here, I propose statistical machine learning techniques and causal inference methods to predict the observed variability of gene expression using only regulatory molecules and estimate their downstream causal effect on the entire transcriptome. To achieve this goal, I start in Aim 1 by building a multi-response predictive model to predict the whole transcriptome using only RMs. This goal is challenging because the dimension of the response vector is more than the number of samples and I will use techniques from high-dimensional statistics to address this issue. In Aim 2, I will go beyond predictive modeling by estimating the causal effect of RMs on the transcriptome using invariant causal prediction. I will leverage the rapidly growing literature which connects causal inference to invariant prediction accuracy across heterogeneous data sources to infer the causal effect of RMs on mRNA. Having developed both predictive and causal models of RMs contribution to gene regulation, in Aim 3 during the R00 phase, I will focus on the most recent advances in double/debiased machine learning which allows the use of scalable machine learning methods for reliable estimation of causal effect of RMs on transcription. My proposed research will bring the most advanced statistical machine learning and causal inference techniques to genomics research and help design more effective targeted therapies by providing insights into the global role of RMs in gene expression regulation. During the training phase of the award, with the support of my outstanding mentoring team and scientific advisory committee, I will gain expertise in molecular biology and genomics while perfecting my knowledge of causal inference and machine learning. The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center – James Hospital and the Mathematical Biosciences Institute will provide me with the ideal interdisciplinary environment to bridge data science and genomics and will help me achieve my career development goals and transition to a tenure-track faculty position. Project Narrative Targeting regulatory elements has the advantage of concurrently attacking multiple damaged pathways, with the possible pitfall of toxicity due to adverse unintended effects. Understanding the functional global impact of therapy on the entire transcriptome will guide us in designing drugs with higher efficacy and lower toxicity.

"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,10018936,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,350896,0.05525812774652037
"Systems Biology of Shape and Size Regulation Abstract The molecular regulation of body shape and size during development and regeneration involves numerous pathways precisely integrated together with the biophysical properties of cellular and tissue dynamics, a complex process poorly understood at the level of whole animals. The overall goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the genetic regulation and coordination of large-scale tissue growth by developing and applying a novel integrated systems biology approach. Combining in vivo experiments and their morphological formalization with machine learning of mathematical biophysical models, we will discern the molecular mechanisms that control growth, shape, and size regulation. We will leverage the robustness of the planarian worm to address the molecular and physical mechanisms regulating their extraordinary homeostatic and regenerative capacity to grow, degrow, and regenerate their whole-body shapes and organs from almost any amputation and across one order of magnitude in sizes. This work will develop novel computational systems biology methods and integrate them with whole-body gene expression imaging and surgical and genetic manipulations assays to elucidate the molecular regulators of body shape and size. Morphological, genetic, and surgical data will be formalized with novel mathematical ontologies, which will serve as input to new machine learning methods able to infer mechanistic gene regulatory networks. The regulatory networks will be quantitatively modeled with a novel mathematical continuous approach for whole-body biophysical simulation, including tissue growth, adhesion molecules, and gene regulation. This computational framework combining machine learning with biophysical modeling will be able to discover the mechanisms of growth and shape regulation from large formalized experimental datasets. Novel genetic interactions will be discovered by the machine learning methodology, which predictions in terms of morphological and gene expression outcomes resulting from genetic and surgical manipulations will be validated at the bench via RNAi and in situ hybridization assays. Integrating machine learning, biophysical mathematical modeling, ontological formalizations, and in vivo surgical and molecular assays represents a comprehensive systems biology approach for elucidating the regulation of shape and size. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of the diverse genetic pathways that regulate tissue growth dynamics and how they interact precisely between them and with tissue biophysics to create and maintain whole-body scale targeted shapes and sizes. This work will pave the way for new applications and novel therapies in human developmental, regenerative, and cancer medicine. Project Narrative The genetic regulation of the shape and size of internal organs and whole body is crucial during development, regeneration, and homeostasis. This project will develop a novel integrated systems biology approach to elucidate mechanistically the molecular pathways and their coordination that control large-scale tissue growth dynamics in living organisms.

"Predictive models of boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs) Predictive Models of Boundaries of Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) in Human. The PI proposes a high-impact research project to develop novel predictive models to predict boundaries of topologically associated domains in a variety of human cell lines. The goal of this proposal is not just building these models, but to interpret them to decipher some biological meaning. Studies have recently indicated that genomes of different organisms are organized into domains called topologically associated domains (TADs), which consist of self-interacting chromatin regions. The boundaries of TADs have been linked to several diseases and gene regulation by modulating the overall genome organization. Accurate identification of these boundaries and interpretation of regulatory units in the boundaries are essential for development of effective therapy for diseases in future. Since existing experimental methods are costly and challenging, we will explore, evaluate, and compare predictive models for accurate prediction of TAD boundaries in different cell lines. We propose to test if sequence and chromatin features can be used in traditional feature based predictive models for TADs boundaries. This will be compared to deep learning models which have the capacity to “learn” important discriminative features from sequence information only. By interpreting these models, we will characterize the regulatory code of TAD boundaries by (a) characterizing a comprehensive list of motifs in TAD boundaries in 10 different human cell lines, (b) characterizing the association between different chromatin features and their predicting power of the boundaries, and (c) scoring, ranking and prioritizing likely causal noncoding variants that occur in TAD boundaries. Furthermore, this proposal will enhance the infrastructure of research and education at University of Houston-Downtown, introducing computational biology research experiences to underrepresented minority, first time in college and female undergraduate students, who would otherwise lack such opportunities. This will allow them to acquire a broad area of skills in data analytics, critical thinking, and research methods, which will encourage them to pursue a biomedical career and change their lives and communities. Understanding genome organization is essential for deciphering the complex mechanisms associated with gene regulation and development of effective therapies for diseases. To address current experimental challenges to quantify genome organization, we propose to develop novel artificial intelligence predictive methods to decipher genome organization in humans. These methods will also help link how genome organization modulates gene expression and how it can contribute to diseases.",Predictive models of boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs),9965292,R15GM137254,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Consumption', 'Critical Thinking', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Education', 'Enhancers', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Insecta', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'college', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'long short term memory', 'mammalian genome', 'model building', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'promoter', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON-DOWNTOWN,R15,2020,399888,0.006695771766807064
"Identifying Genetic and Epigenetic Risk Factors Regulating Gene Expression for Childhood Asthma Candidate: Dr. Soyeon Kim obtained her Ph.D. degree in Statistics at Rice University. For her doctoral research, she developed statistical machine learning methods to identify biomarkers for precision medicine approaches to treating lung cancer. She is currently a post-doctoral fellow at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP) and supported by a T32 grant awarded to one of her mentors, Dr. Juan C. Celedón. The goal of her research is to understand the pathogenesis of diseases by developing statistical methods for integrative analysis of multi-omics data. She is an author and co-author of eight manuscripts, including ones in high-profile journals such as Nature Genetics. Environment: CHP, affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, is a leading pediatric center for clinical care, research, and educational excellence. Dr. Kim works in the Rangos Research Center, comprised of nine floors of state-of-the-art laboratories, offices, and conference facilities. In addition to superb mentoring by Drs. Wei Chen, Juan C. Celedón and George Tseng, she will use the Pittsburgh supercomputing center (PSC), an excellent source of computing powers for intensive bioinformatics work. Research: Although both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation play important roles in regulating gene expression, the associations between SNPs/DNA methylation and expression of disease genes in childhood asthma are mostly unknown. Due to the multiple-testing problem, most studies focus on identifying the regulation of gene expression by cis- (nearby) DNA features, rather than a combination of cis- and trans (far from genes) regulation. To overcome the major multiple-testing problem, we will develop a novel statistical machine learning method that can handle a large number of variables of omics data without multiple- testing correction issues. In Aim 1, I will identify cis and trans genetic (SNPs) and epigenetic (methylation) factors that regulate gene expression in the nasal epithelium of asthmatic and healthy subjects. Through this analysis, I will uncover novel SNPs and methylation CpGs that may have not been found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). In Aim 2, I will estimate the genetic and epigenetic contributions to the expressions of genes that are associated with atopic asthma. This study also will classify genes that are affected the most by genetic factors and genes that are affected mostly by epigenetic factors, which include environmental factors. In Aim 3, I will develop statistical methods to identify SNPs that indirectly regulate gene expression through methylation in nasal epithelium of asthmatic and healthy subjects. The outcome of this work will be a better understanding of the abnormal molecular and cellular mechanisms through which asthma develops, and the application of this knowledge to help to produce new therapies for asthma. Project Narrative 6 million children in the US suffer from asthma, and the likelihood that any child will develop asthma depends heavily on their genetic and epigenetic regulations. My statistical machine learning models will identify new genetic and epigenetic risk factors that are associated with childhood asthma by regulating the expression of disease-causing or disease-preventing genes. This knowledge will help to advance precision medicine approaches to treating childhood asthma.",Identifying Genetic and Epigenetic Risk Factors Regulating Gene Expression for Childhood Asthma,10038897,K01HL153792,"['Affect', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CISH gene', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Floor', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Puerto Rican', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supercomputing', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Work', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical center', 'differential expression', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'genome wide association study', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2020,141178,0.014645911739495318
"Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Several recent high- throughput technologies based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as 4C, 5C, Hi-C and ChIA-PET) and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study the higher-order genome organization. Among them, Hi-C technology is of particular interest due to its unbiased genome-wide coverage that can measure chromatin interaction intensities between any two given genomic loci. However, Hi-C data analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. One of the main challenges is how to efficiently visualize chromatin interaction data, so that the scientific community to visualize and use it for their own research. In addition, due to the complex experimental procedure and high sequencing cost, Hi-C has only been performed in a limited number of cell/tissue types. Finally, the underlying mechanism of chromatin interactions remains largely unclear. Therefore, the PI will propose the following aims: Aim 1. Build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser. We will build an interactive and customizable 3D browser, which allows users to navigate Hi-C data and other high-throughput chromatin organization data, including ChIA-PET and Capture Hi-C. We have built a prototype of the 3D genome browser (www.3dgenome.org). Our browser will allow users to conveniently browse chromatin interaction data with other data types (such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq) from the genomic region in the same window simultaneously. Our system will also empower the users to create their own session and query their own Hi-C and other epigenomic data. Aim 2. Impute chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomic information. We will predict Hi-C interaction frequencies using other available genomic and epigenomic data in the same cell type, such as ChIP-Seq data for histone modifications and transcription factors. We will build our prediction model and then systematically impute Hi-C interaction matrices for all 127 cell types whose epigenomes are available thanks to recent effort by the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome projects. Aim 3. Perform validation experiments for computational method in aim 1 and 2. We will perform 20 3C experiments in hESC and GM cell lines, coupled with genome engineering by CRISPR/Cas9, to evaluate Hi-C prediction method in aim 2. The three dimensional (3D) organization of mammalian genomes is tightly linked to gene regulation, as it can reveal the physical interactions between distal regulatory elements and their target genes. Although several recent high-throughput technologies including Hi-C have emerged and given us an unprecedented opportunity to study 3D chromatin interaction in high resolution, its analysis and interpretation are still in the early stages. Here we propose to develop a suite of statistical modeling and computational methods to model and validate chromatin interaction using other genomic/epigenomics data, and build an interactive and customizable 3D genome browser.","Visualization, modeling and validation of chromatin interaction data",9840492,R01HG009906,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Intuition', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Procedures', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome browser', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'interest', 'mammalian genome', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repository', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web site']",NHGRI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,395000,0.03376458516163095
"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation. Recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques has allowed us to look beyond the nucleotide sequence of DNA and investigate the principles of higher-order chromatin organization.

"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease. As such, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that seeks to develop fundamental knowledge to inform our diagnosis and treatment of human disease.",Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing,9932470,R01HG007173,"['Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Consumption', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'KDM1A gene', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'RNA purification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribonucleases', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Small Nucleolar RNA', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'hematopoietic differentiation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'promoter', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NHGRI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,517318,0.013340202435537067
"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution. Ultimately, without an understanding of the adaptive potential of translation we have an incomplete, and imperfect, picture of the underlying genetic causes of numerous forms of cancer and genetic diseases.",The adaptive potential of translational regulation,9893712,F32GM131573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Pathology', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Nutrient', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathology', 'Performance at work', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translation Initiation', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cancer genetics', 'collaborative environment', 'driver mutation', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'preservation', 'promoter', 'response', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,65310,0.0019977299550457666
"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",9983094,R01GM134056,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Complement', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Homeostasis', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Model', 'Plants', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Toxin', 'Transgenes', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biophysical properties', 'bisulfite', 'density', 'epigenetic memory', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'trait', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2020,319720,0.045040198212432395
"Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, thousands of experiments from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have successfully proﬁled regulatory elements and epigenetic landscape along the genome. More recently, over 2,000 chromatin organization datasets have been generated from 4D Nucleome (4DN) Project, and they provide complementary information about how these genomic and epigenomic elements are spatially organized in a nucleus. Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization with previously proﬁled 1D epigenome in different cell types will be a key step to understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation over long genomic distances. However, there are two challenges. First, there is a resolution mismatch between chromatin organization data (e.g. Hi-C contacts) which are usually measured at 10k base pair resolution, and epigenome-based chromatin state features (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) whose signals are usually at tens to hundreds of base pairs. Second, existing computational approaches for analyzing epigenome, such as annotating genome and understanding regulatory elements, all treat the DNA sequence as one-dimensional data, leaving the important 3D structural information unutilized. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches for understanding the relationship between chromatin state features and chromatin organization, performing 3D and 4D genome annotation, and identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors, respectively. After the completion of the proposed work, we expect to have: (1) an accurate and interpretable computational model to predict chromatin contact maps at nucleosome resolution for a wide range of cell lines, (2) 3D and 4D genome annotations over dynamic chromatin organization, regulatory elements and epigenomic features, and (3) a computational method for identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors which can help us understand the orchestration of noncoding genetic variants. These results will provide fundamental understanding of disease-relevant genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to jointly analyze 3D chromatin organization data and 1D epigenomic features, and reveal the interplay among regulatory elements, epigenomic features, and dynamic chromatin organization. These new methods will help us understand the mechanisms of the genetic variants identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies, and understand the genetic basis of many human diseases.",Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome,10046394,R35HG011279,"['3-Dimensional', 'Base Pairing', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Genome Project', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nucleosomes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'genome annotation', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'novel', 'three dimensional structure', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2020,432839,-0.00027979110203736683
"From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how the genome functions is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Encoded within its DNA sequences are the blueprints for several cell types. Nevertheless, it remains a mystery how the full variety of phenotypes arise, and how they are maintained. It is becoming increasingly clear that the epigenome— covalent modifications to the DNA and histone proteins—plays a crucial role. Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic modifications has clarified cell type specificity and the presence of a diverse set of combinatorial patterns that are strongly correlated with gene expression levels. Inferring causal relationships from these data has proved challenging, however. A working knowledge of the mechanisms that inform the establishment and regulation of the epigenome, and its impact on gene expression and cellular phenotype, therefore, remain elusive. In this project, we propose several novel modeling approaches which will address the key gaps in our understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and genome. First, we will parameterize a coarse- grained chromatin model from the bottom-up using a novel deep learning algorithm to generate an accurate and comprehensive characterization of chromatin secondary structure, and its sensitivity to DNA sequence, nucleosome repeat length, ionic concentrations, post-translational modifications, and phase-separated liquid- droplets formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. High resolution chromatin structures from this effort will elucidate how different epigenetic modifications impact gene expression by regulating nucleosome packaging and DNA accessibility. Second, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating long-range interactions between regulatory elements by developing a predictive model which will enable de novo reconstruction of three-dimensional genome organization. This project will result in a global view of the role of the epigenome in cell differentiation and cell fate determination. An improved understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and the genome from this research program can guide the development of engineering approaches to modify the epigenome for both long lasting and reversible changes as a novel strategy for combating diseases such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The epigenome works hand-in-hand with the genome to encode cell phenotypic diversity for multicellular organisms. We will apply interdisciplinary approaches to disentangle the interrelationship between the two, thus elucidating the role of the genome in establishing and maintaining a robust epigenome, and providing mechanistic insight into epigenetic regulations of the genome’s function. Insights from our study will pave the way for rational epigenome engineering which holds great potential for transforming medicine and biotechnology.",From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization,9986842,R35GM133580,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Back', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Chromatin Structure', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Grain', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'combat', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2020,377555,0.047649129693105786
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9984421,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'diverse data', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'informatics tool', 'learning network', 'men', 'next generation sequence data', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2020,464920,0.005409906573659042
"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals. Dr. Jesse Gillis, expert in transcriptome meta-analysis, and Dr. Josh Huang, expert in GABAergic interneuron identity, will be my mentors. Dr. Bing Ren, Dr. Adam Siepel, Dr. Guoping Feng, Dr. Jessica Tollkuhn and Dr. Michael Greenberg will be collaborators and members of my advisory committee, ensuring that my research will be of the highest caliber. My training will also involve coursework in multiomics data integration and comparative genomics, and I will continue my professional development by presenting at international conferences, mentoring students and attending workshops at CSHL. Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear.

"Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases Project Summary/Abstract Many diseases are understudied because they are rare or of little public interest. The effect of each understudied disease may be limited, but the cumulative effects of all these diseases could be profound. One common research challenge for these diseases is that the resources allocated to each is often limited. For instance, large- scale screening of drugs is often challenging, if not possible, in small labs. The decreasing costs of next generation sequencing make possible the generation of gene expression profiles of understudied disease samples. Integrating these expression profiles with other open data provides tremendous opportunities to gain insights into disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutics for understudied diseases. We have utilized a systems-based approach that employs gene expression profiles of disease samples and drug-induced gene expression profiles from cancer cell lines to predict new therapeutic candidates for hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma and basal cell carcinoma. All these candidates were successfully validated in preclinical models. The success of this approach relies on multiscale procedures, such as quality control of disease samples, selection of appropriate reference tissues, evaluation of disease signatures, and weighting cell lines. There is a plethora of relevant datasets and analysis modules that are publicly available, yet are isolated in distinct silos, making it tedious to implement this approach in translational research. A centralized informatics system that allows prediction of therapeutics for further experimental validation is thus of great interest to researchers working on understudied diseases. Accordingly, we propose four specific aims: 1) developing novel deep learning methods to select precise reference normal tissues for disease signature creation, 2) developing computational methods to reuse drug profiles from other disease models for drug prediction, 3) integrating open efficacy data to identify new targets from the systems-based approach, and 4) developing a centralized platform and promoting the platform in the scientific community. This proposal will reuse several big open databases (e.g., TCGA, TARGET, GTEx, GEO, LINCS, CTRP, GDSC) and employ cutting-edge informatics methods (e.g., deep learning). To demonstrate the scalability of the system, we will investigate three representative understudied diseases: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Aim 1), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (Aim 2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Aim 3). Successful implementation of the systems-based approach can be used as a model for using other large open omics (proteins, metabolites) to discover therapeutics for diseases with unmet needs. This proposal will bring together experts in informatics, statistics, computer science, and physicians from Michigan State University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Spectrum Health. All data and code will be released to the public for continuing development. The system will be deployed to our OCTAD portal (http://octad.org), an open workplace for therapeutic discovery. Project Narrative About 25 million people are living with understudied diseases in the U.S. Although there are voluminous high dimensional molecular datasets that could be leveraged for research, individual labs have limited computational capacity to translate these molecular features into therapeutic hits. We propose to build a centralized information system that allows individual labs to easily harness open gene expression datasets and generate new therapeutic targets or drug candidates for further experimental validation.",Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases,9998976,R01GM134307,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Asia', 'Basal Cell', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Cancer cell line', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evaluation', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Ramp', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'System', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cancer gene expression', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'disorder control', 'drug candidate', 'drug mechanism', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'overexpression', 'pill', 'protein metabolite', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,413916,0.02508205056541801
"Advanced algorithms to infer and analyze 3D genome structures Project Summary For the past decade, the population-cell Hi-C technique has significantly improved our ability to discover genome-wide DNA proximities. However, because population Hi-C is based on a pool of cells, it will not help us reveal each single cell's 3D genome structure or understand cell-to-cell variability in terms of 3D genome structure and gene regulation. It is also difficult to achieve a high resolution, such as 1 Kbp, with population Hi- C; therefore, when finding and analyzing the spatial interactions for the promoter or enhancer regions typically associated with biologically-important regulatory elements, population Hi-C data's resolution is too low to be useful. Moreover, while we know that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a key role in the formation of genome 3D structures, the question is whether long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the process since lncRNAs have been found to recruit proteins needed for chromatin remodeling, and our preliminary research has found that lncRNA LINC00346 directly interacts with CTCF. Finally, while members of the bioinformatics community, including the PI, have developed many algorithms to reconstruct 3D genome structures based on population Hi-C data, important questions still must be answered regarding how 3D genome structures are involved in gene regulation and whether there are relationships between 3D genome structures and genetic and epigenetic features. The PI proposes to conduct leading research to overcome these challenges and address these questions. During the next five years, the PI will develop algorithms to reconstruct the 3D whole- genome structures for single cells and analyze cell-to-cell variabilities in terms of 3D genome structure and gene regulation. The PI will develop a deep learning algorithm to enhance the resolution of population Hi-C data to that of Capture Hi-C data (1 Kbp) so that we can make good use of the large amount of Hi-C data accumulated in the past decade. An online database will be built to allow the community to access both population and single-cell 3D genome structures in an integrated way. The PI will work with a cancer biologist to discover any lncRNAs that function as a scaffold to fine-tune the CTCF-cohesin protein complex, as well as two neuron scientists to develop a more complete understanding of gene regulation while considering 3D genome and other genetic and epigenetic features. Given the PI's track record and productivity, having three computational goals and two collaborative goals is not only feasible but computationally and biologically rewarding. In five years, once the proposed studies are accomplished, the PI should have established a uniquely independent place in the field of 3D genome, maintaining leading positions in inferring single-cell 3D genome structures, enhancing Hi-C data resolution, and building 3D genome databases, while establishing similar positions in reconstructing high-resolution 3D genome structures, finding lncRNAs' roles in the formation of genome structures, and understanding how 3D genome structures are involved in gene regulation. Project Narrative The three-dimensional (3D) structure of genome is critically important for gene regulation; and the abnormal 3D genome structures are often associated with diseases such as cancer. This proposal aims to reconstruct and analyze the 3D genome structures of thousands of individual cells, study how 3D genome structures participate in gene regulation, determine whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the formation of genome structures, and build an online knowledge base integrating 3D genome structures with other biological information.",Advanced algorithms to infer and analyze 3D genome structures,10027542,R35GM137974,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Neurons', 'Other Genetics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'base', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cohesin', 'deep learning algorithm', 'genome database', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional structure', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R35,2020,354694,0.0007354514268158168
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,9932407,R01GM131398,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Targeting', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,325001,-0.0007055874214644088
"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",10021007,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic agent', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Embryonic Development', 'Estrogens', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'biophysical model', 'gene interaction', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neurogenomics', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'social', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2020,356979,0.014668741993699991
"New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT    Cellular state transitions (i.e. from pluripotent to committed, replicative to quiescent, etc.) require the  coordinated regulation of thousands of genes. Therapeutically harnessing these transitions holds great  promise for human health;; for instance, autologous stem cell therapy has been successfully used in  regenerative medicine and cancer treatments, among others. While some of the key regulatory switches are  known, the field lacks a systems-­level understanding of the genomic circuits that control these transitions,  information that is critical for informed clinical intervention. Here, we will develop an integrated computational  framework to identify core gene regulatory circuits from large gene networks and predict their dynamics and  regulatory functions without the need of detailed network kinetic parameters. Advances in genomics profiling  technology have enabled the mapping of gene regulatory networks, thus we now have the capacity to identify  combinatorial interactions among genes and the master regulators of state transitions. Some systems biology  approaches have simulated the dynamics of a gene regulatory circuit, but traditional methods suffer from two  key issues. First, there is no rational rule to choose an appropriate set of regulator genes in a large network to  model. Second, since it is hard to directly measure most network kinetic parameters from experiment,  modeling results are based on a set of guessed parameters that can be less than optimal, limiting the  application of mathematical modeling to large systems and the prediction power of systems biology. To  address these issues, we recently developed algorithm named random circuit perturbation (RACIPE). RACIPE  generates an ensemble of circuit models, each of which corresponds to a distinct set of random kinetic  parameters, and uniquely identifies robust features, such as clusters of stable gene expression states, by  statistical analysis. We will further enhance RACIPE algorithms for large systems and new data analysis tools  using machine learning. This approach will convert a traditional nonlinear dynamics problem into a data  analysis problem, an essential step for extending the application of gene circuit modeling to large systems. It  also provides a novel strategy to integrate top-­down genomics approaches with bottom-­up mathematical  modeling. The algorithms will be tested and refined using literature-­based gene networks, public genomics  data, and data from collaboration, with a focus on cell differentiation in developmental processes and state  transitions in oncogenesis. Success of the project will result in a comprehensive toolkit that will unveil the gene  regulatory mechanism of cellular decision-­making in any cell of interest. The algorithmic development is   expected to have a broad impact on not only basic research in systems biology but also shed light on  therapeutic intervention in genomic medicine.      RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  Most human complex diseases are multigenic, but our understanding of the interactions between genes in  healthy states and how they are disrupted in disease states is lacking. Computational algorithms will be  designed to construct and model gene regulatory circuits of higher complexity to fill an important gap in our  understanding of the maintenance and transitions among cellular states and their abnormal behavior in  disease. In this proposal, we will develop a suite of systems-­biology tools to extend gene circuit modeling to  large systems and integrate genomics data relevant to fundamental cell biology, cancer, and other human  diseases.   ",New Computational Systems Biology Methods for Modeling Gene Regulatory Circuits,10246751,R35GM128717,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autologous', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Public Health', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'novel strategies', 'stem cell therapy', 'success', 'tool', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,392500,0.03218848945748445
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,9898392,R35GM131845,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth', 'Hermaphroditism', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'autosome', 'chromatin modification', 'condensin', 'dosage', 'histone demethylase', 'male', 'man', 'neural network', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'sex', 'sex determination', 'single molecule', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2020,466290,0.055146622588898034
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs.

"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF.

"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9980439,R35GM128938,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Distal', 'Experimental Designs', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graph theory', 'histone modification', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'statistics', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2020,449649,0.024789205521563183
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9979887,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,400001,0.009156137012959972
"Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors ABSTRACT Cellular compartments are coordinated through a dynamic bidirectional communication network amongst various organelles. Here, we focus on the communication between mitochondria and the nucleus, organelles that each possess their own genomes. The mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have co-evolved for over a billion years and have likely required close communication and cross-regulation. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by over 1,000 nuclear-encoded proteins, but there is currently no known mitochondrial-encoded factor that actively communicates to and regulates the nucleus. We have recently identified a novel gene encoded within the mitochondrial DNA and named it MOTS-c (Mitochondrial ORF within the Twelve S rRNA type-c). MOTS-c is a small 16 amino acid peptide that regulates metabolic homeostasis, in part, via the master nutrient sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). We recently reported that MOTS-c can translocate into the nucleus in response to metabolic stress to bind to chromatin and regulate nuclear gene expression. Further, our preliminary study using a multi-pronged approach, including single cell RNA-seq, bioinformatics (including machine learning), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR), and cell sorting, showed that MOTS-c can regulate cellular proliferation; MOTS-c targeted the p53/p21 pathway and ribosomal processes. Considering the important metabolic role of mitochondria in cellular proliferation processes (29), a critical question that remains largely enigmatic is how mitochondrial-encoded factors communicate to the nucleus to coordinate the metabolic shift with gene expression during proliferation. Notably, rapidly dividing cancer cells had undetectable levels of MOTS-c or nuclear-translocation deficiency, suggesting loss of mito-nuclear communication by MOTS-c. Together, cancer may be a genetic disease in which our two genomes exist in a state of disrupted bi-directional communication/regulation, and may serve as a unique model to start understanding the role of MOTS-c in cellular proliferation. Because MOTS-c expression/function was dysregulated and that MOTS-c can negatively regulate cell cycle/proliferation, we hypothesize that MOTS-c is a mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressor, the first of its kind to be identified, that directly regulates the nucleus to coordinate cellular metabolism with proliferation. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis. First, we will characterize MOTS-c as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell proliferation at the molecular, cellular, genetic level. Second, we will comprehensively map the MOTS-c-dependent functional nuclear genomic landscape using multiple complimentary genomics approach, including single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility), and genomic footprinting using ChIP-seq. The data from each genomic approach will be integrated using cutting-edge computational methods, including machine learning, to decipher the message(s) MOTS- c delivers to the nuclear genome to regulate cancer cell proliferation and survival. Lastly, we will determine how MOTS- c-mediated communication to the nucleus can differentially regulate cellular proliferation and stress resistance in normal and malignant cells using mouse models of cancer. If successful, we predict that our study will have broad and lasting impact on (i) basic research by introducing the paradigm-shifting concept of mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressors that coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation and (ii) therapeutic development by revealing mtDNA as a source of novel drug targets (currently there are no FDA-approved drugs based on the mitochondrial genome). PROJECT NARRATIVE Key cellular functions, such as proliferation, require the coordination of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes through dynamic bi-directional communication. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by many nuclear-encoded proteins, the nucleus has traditionally been not considered to be actively regulated by mitochondrial-encoded factors. We propose to study how a novel tumor suppressor peptide encoded in the mitochondrial genome that we identified directly regulates the nuclear genome to coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation.",Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors,9944175,R01GM136837,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adenosine Monophosphate', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Bacteria', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Stress', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Diet', 'Electron Transport', 'Endothelium', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'In Vitro', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Language', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Normal Cell', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Translocation', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organelles', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'age related', 'antitumor effect', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'exhaustion', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'immune function', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'loss of function', 'mitochondrial genome', 'mouse model', 'muscle metabolism', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'therapeutic development', 'tumor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,326942,-0.004307485476962172
"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state. Here we propose to develop computational tools to define how one type of epigenetic modification, called hydroxymethylation, impacts gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. These tools will be versatile and adaptable to any cell type of choice, enabling research into the molecular features of the genome that underlie both normal and pathological cell behaviors.",An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation,9986833,R35GM133562,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'B cell differentiation', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'next generation sequencing', 'prevent', 'programs', 'stem cell differentiation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2020,472500,0.03294242239077037
"ImmGen: Gene Expression and Regulation in Immune Cells The Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) is a collaborative group of 15 Immunology and Computational Biology laboratories who perform, under standardized conditions, a thorough dissection of gene expression and its regulation in the mouse immune system. We also investigated how these respond to cytokines and immunologic challenges, how immune gene expression relates to chromatin configuration, and used cutting-edge computational algorithms to deduce regulatory connections. ImmGen data are publicly available on dedicated web and smartphone supports, using interactive graphic displays that make the results intuitive to users. These are now frequently used by the Immunology research community. The proposed continuation will harness the collective expertise of the ImmGen group to further develop this important public resource. (1) Expand and deepen the compendium, applying single-cell RNAseq to define very broadly the cast of cell-types at play in the immune system, their trajectories of differentiation, and their adaptation to specific organismal locations This effort will be complemented by deeper bulk profiling of cell-types thus identified. We will expand the analysis of cytokine signatures, continue to chart non-coding RNA (circRNAs), and persue the “OpenSource” program of coordinated sample contributions from the community. (2) Mechanistic Dissection of Immunogenomic Regulatory Networks focusing on a Core Set of 14 cell-types that represent all the major immunological lineages. We will generate high-resolution maps of transcription factor footprints by ultra-deep ATACseq; map 3D architectures by HiC chromosome conformation capture; apply ChIPseq to define enhancers and super-enhancers, chromatin modification domains and structural anchors; use machine learning approaches to integrate these complementary data into a comprehensive regulatory plan which spans from fine TF footprints to topologically associated domaiins; validate these inferences by collaborating with the KOMP project to analyze Core Set transcriptomes and chromatin configuration in mice with mutations in transcription factors that determine functionally relevant facets of immunocyte activity. (3): Public Display. ImmGen data have become a widely used resource in Immunology research, which will be maintained and curated. For scalability, cost-effectiveness, and to enable facile computation, we will develop and deploy cloud-based data storage and access solutions, compliant with NIH Commons guidelines. We will add to the existing databrowsers to allow users to query different facets of the expanding data (differential expression, regulatory network, chromatin states and architecture, cytokine signatures), increasing connectivity to other data sources. We will continue developing the popular mobile app, and explore the particular uses of that medium.

"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",9855022,U01HG009395,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Encyclopedias', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Output', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Ploidies', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'sequence learning', 'supervised learning', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,742538,0.05936506076142235
"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills.

"Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort ABSTRACT  Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting the exocrine system, with hallmark symptoms of dry mouth and/or dry eyes caused by the dysfunction of salivary and/or lacrimal glands, respectively. While Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and other studies have increased our knowledge of genetic risk factors for SS, the disease etiology remains not well understood, and such risk factors have not been translatable to any immunological treatment options for SS. The NIH-NIDCR-funded Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) was established to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of patients with SS by developing/validating standardized classification criteria for SS; and developing a rich biospecimen repository with clinical data to be used for future epidemiologic, pathogenesis, and genetic studies of SS.[1, 2] For this project, we will focus on genomic data and measures of the 2016 ACR-EULAR classification criteria, involving ocular, oral, and autoantibody manifestations. As shown in our previous work, the genetics of SS varies with ancestry; thus, we will cluster patients by both the criteria subphenotypes and genetic ancestry. We believe that accounting for disease heterogeneity in this way will enable us to more precisely identify disease pathways and mechanisms. Using previously secured funding, we are completing DNA methylation typing on LSGs in 373 SICCA patients and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on PBMCs of 86 SICCA patients who also have DNA methylation profiling. This data provides a unique opportunity for multi-omics analysis to determine correlates between LSG tissue epigenetics, peripheral blood cell-type distributions and cell-specific gene expression by SS subsets. First, using GWAS data and DNA methylation data from LSG biopsies, we will identify genetic and epigenetic modifications associated with subtypes of SS in SICCA patients. We will then examine the relationships between them by testing for genotype-specific methylation and expression, and utilizing mendelian randomization and causal inference testing to investigate causality between these measures. Second, we will analyze scRNAseq data to identify how cell types, states and cell- specific gene expression correlate with SS subtypes. Finally, we will integrate genetics, epigenetics, and transcriptomics to determine multi-omics profiles associated with SS subtypes. We will jointly model associated features from the genomic data to investigate causal pathways via correlation networks, conditional analysis, and machine learning. We anticipate that SS subtypes will exhibit specific relationships within the multi- omics data and that this will advance our understanding of SS disease processes, leading to better treatment targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal leverages unique NIDCR-funded resources by utilizing existing infrastructure and data with high level expertise to better understand the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome and identify new therapeutic pathways. We propose to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data recently generated on patients of the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) biorepository/registry. We will identify genomic determinants of subtypes of SS derived from subphenotypes and genetic ancestry, which we believe will be more indicative of underlying biologic pathways and will lead to more appropriate genomic candidates for SS treatments.",Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort,10041649,R03DE029800,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'American', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cells', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exanthema', 'Exhibits', 'Exocrine System', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Immunologics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Laboratories', 'Lacrimal gland structure', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'college', 'differential expression', 'disease heterogeneity', 'epigenome', 'eye dryness', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'methylation testing', 'monocyte', 'multiple omics', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2020,161500,0.010805346115756195
"Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology There is now incontrovertible evidence from sophisticated lineage tracing studies that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) de-differentiation contributes substantively to a number of vascular diseases. A major manifesta- tion of such phenotypic change is attenuated expression of a battery of VSMC-restricted genes, including the enigmatic smooth muscle calponin (Cnn1) gene. The function of Cnn1 has been studied primarily in vitro or in a single knockout mouse wherein several exons and introns were replaced with a neo cassette which, as detailed below, obfuscates accurate interpretation of phenotypes. We have championed the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system in mice to engineer subtle substitutions within regulatory elements of many genes, leaving intact all coding sequences. We report here a remarkable phenotype wherein a single base change of a single CArG box in the Cnn1 locus abolishes expression of CNN1 in vascular (but not visceral) SMC. Full expression of CNN1 is restored with a BAC carrying human CNN1 or CRISPR-mediated activation of the en- dogenous Cnn1 promoter. Cnn1 CArG mutant mice, representing the first animal models of regulatory element edits, also show elevation in VSMC DNA synthesis and defective contractile competence. Conversely, over- expression of BAC-CNN1 suppresses VSMC growth, antagonizes neointimal formation, reduces VSMC lipid uptake, and enhances contractile gene expression. Interestingly, CNN1-Ser175 appears to be a critical residue for some of these effects making it an attractive amino acid for CRISPR-mediated editing in mice. Additional data support CNN1 as a scaffold for ERK signaling and effector of the immotile state of differentiated VSMC. Importantly, a complete understanding of CNN1 function is complicated by robust expression of two related genes (Cnn2 and Cnn3) in VSMC. We hypothesize that CNN1 functions in concert with other CNN isoforms to maintain a mature VSMC differentiated state. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims using state-of-the-art tools in genetics, animal models of disease, and molecular physiology assays of VSMC function. Aim 1 will exploit the single base edit in Cnn1 as a novel loss-of-function mouse in context of acute and chronic vascular disease models; complementation studies will be carried out in vitro and in vivo to rigorously ascribe pheno- typic changes to the specific loss of CNN1. Aim 2 will exploit a well-characterized BAC mouse to elucidate functions associated with Cnn1 gain-of-function in models of vascular disease used in Aim 1. Complementary CRISPR editing of the BAC mouse, in background of Cnn1 KO, will afford exquisite insight into functional residues that mediate CNN1 function. Aim 3 will exploit new floxed Cnn2 and Cnn3 mice with an exciting VSMC-specific Cre driver we have developed to address, for the first time, triple Cnn KO mouse models at baseline and in acute or chronic vascular disease models. These studies, based on paradigm-shifting approaches to gene KOs, serve as a template for the study of other gene families linked to VSMC differen- tiation and will inform future studies targeting CNN1 in diseases where VSMC differentiation is compromised. Diseases of blood vessels involve radical changes in the normal program of gene expression and function, the underlying nature of which is poorly understood. We have used the revolutionary CRISPR system of genome editing to study a gene called CNN1, which is specific for smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. We will study this gene, along with related genes, in both cells and blood vessels to gain new insights into vascular diseases.",Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology,10053587,R01HL136224,"['Actins', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Injury', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Cre driver', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Introns', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'LoxP-flanked allele', 'MAPK3 gene', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'base', 'calponin', 'cell growth', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'myocardin', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vascular injury', 'vascular smooth muscle cell migration']",NHLBI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,571166,0.010955879509515092
"Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline Project Summary Despite extraordinary advances in genome engineering, tools for precise and efficient gene correction and delivery across all cell types remain lacking. Current programmable DNA cleavage tools, such as meganucleases, Zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR- Cas9, rely on recruiting the DNA repair machinery, either using error-prone, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for gene knockout, or homology directed repair (HDR) for precise correction. However, HDR is inactive in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, and is often inefficient, achieving 50% correction at most. Genome editing still lacks efficient, robust tools that can insert, delete, and recombine large stretches of DNA sequence. Moreover, delivery tools are a significant barrier to deploying tissue-specific genomic engineering technologies as current vehicles, including widely-used viral vectors and liposomal approaches, have limited capacity, offer variable efficiency, and lack precise tissue tropism. The proposed work involves computationally mining bacteria for new classes of gene editing enzymes and delivery vectors. We know that natural recombinases and transposases can mediate programmed DNA rearrangement and insertion, and these classes of enzymes are present in phage defense and mobile islands in bacteria, which largely remain uncharacterized. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that retroviral/retrotransposon gag-like proteins can self-assemble and encapsulate nucleic acid in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and viral-like particles (VLPs) for cell-to-cell communication. As with defense islands, these proteins can also be systematically catalogued via a bioinformatic pipeline and experimentally characterized. The proposed work will focus on three main goals: 1) signatures for phage defense, mobile genetic activity, or VLP-forming activity will be mined to build a machine learning pipeline for comprehensively discovering novel gene clusters from novel metagenomic sequences with a focus for proteins that can manipulate nucleic acid or self-assemble, 2) candidate gene clusters will be cloned from metagenomic samples and undergo high-throughput screening using biochemical and bacterial assays for gene editing and capsid formation, as well as engineering to hone activity, and 3) the most promising candidates will be evaluated for activity in mammalian systems with assays for highly efficient gene insertion and VLP formation. The work will elucidate novel bacterial phage defense and VLP biology, and result in the development of new technologies for more efficient genetic manipulation and gene delivery. Moreover, this gene exploration and engineering framework will serve as a model for discovering diverse bacterial gene clusters and defense systems, evaluating biochemical activity across a range of assays, and converting these findings into high impact biotechnologies. The developed technologies will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable greater exploration of basic biological processes and disease mechanisms. Project Narrative There are more than 5,000 human diseases caused by known genetic variation, including mutations, insertions, and deletions, but programmable tools and delivery vectors to reliably study and model these diseases are lacking. We propose a two-pronged approach to discovering novel gene editing and delivery strategies by (1) mining bacterial and archaeal systems to identify novel defense systems and enzymes that have activities useful for genome editing and (2) identifying gene clusters linked to extracellular vesicle or viral-like particle formation that will allow development of better gene delivery systems. The technologies developed from this work will accelerate the study and modeling of disease biology and provide a framework for general prokaryotic gene discovery across many biotechnological areas.","Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline",9873379,R21AI149694,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacterial Model', 'Bacteriophages', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Capsid', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Elements', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Transfer', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Island', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liposomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Mining', 'Mitotic', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stretching', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Transposase', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'cell regeneration', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental adaptation', 'enzyme activity', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene delivery system', 'gene discovery', 'gene repair', 'genetic manipulation', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knockout gene', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein profiling', 'recombinase', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'restraint', 'screening', 'technology development', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'vector genome', 'zinc finger nuclease']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,188250,0.012710788463797305
"Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation Abstract Macrophages in Greek means “big eaters"" are powerful cellular components of innate immunity. They play a pivotal role in immune defense by ‘eating’ pathogens, dead or cancerous cells. They also contribute to tissue homeostasis, development and repair. When doing their job, macrophages react to their surroundings and trigger acute inflammation to resolve the problems. They do so by assuming one of the two states that have been widely recognized, i.e., immunoreactive (proinflammatory) and immunotolerant (a.k.a, M1 and M2, respectively). While finite degrees of reactivity and tolerance are desirable in physiology, excess of either state is undesirable and invariably associated with disease pathogenesis (i.e., the Goldilocks conundrum). For example, hyperreactivity is recognized as the root cause of tissue injury in a wide array of diseases (colitis, sepsis, NASH) and hypertolerance is a common determinant that drives most, if not all chronic diseases that are incurable, e.g., cancers. Consensus on the definition of these physiologic and pathologic macrophage states has not been reached, perhaps because of 4 major challenges: heterogeneity, biological robustness, the temporal evolution of the network, and artifacts (tremendous plasticity of macrophages as they drift rapidly when isolated from tissues). We have used a novel computational methodology, Boolean Implication Network [Sahoo 2008], to analyze pooled human macrophage gene expression datasets. This method, which identifies asymmetric gene expression patterns, blurs noise (heterogeneity/artifacts) but reveals a temporal model of events that is invariably seen across all datasets. The analysis revealed hitherto unknown continuum transition states between reactive to tolerant states along five paths; machine-learning identified one of them as the major path which subsequently stood the rigorous test/validation on multiple publicly available transcriptomic datasets, across species (mouse and human), macrophage subtypes and disease states. Most importantly, unlike other commonly used gene cluster signatures, the Boolean path can prognosticate outcomes across diverse diseases. Preliminary validation studies on a genetic model confirm that the path could be exploited for modulating macrophage polarization by altering LPS/TLR4 responses. We will now interrogate the impact of these discoveries using an iterative approach, i.e., model-driven experimentation and experiment-driven model refinement, through three aims: Unravel the importance of novel molecular drivers in the newly identified gene signatures of macrophage polarization using semi-HTP chemical/genetic screens on murine and human monocyte-derived macrophages (Aim 1), in murine disease models of hyperreactivity and hypertolerance (Aim 2) and in “Humanoids”, i.e., human organoid-based microbe/immune cells co-culture models (“gut-in-a-dish”; Aim 3). Although our focus is gastrointestinal infection and inflammation, the findings will define macrophage transition states in multiple organs/disease contexts and therefore, impact many fields. We expect to identify high-value therapeutic targets that can restrict and/or reset macrophage responses to infections and inflammation within the “Goldilocks zone.” Narrative Macrophages are powerful cellular components of innate immunity; on the one hand they play a pivotal role in defending against pathogens, cancerous cells and other harmful stimuli by being immunoreactive, and on the other hand, they contribute to tissue homeostasis by being immunotolerant to harmless antigens and beneficial microbes. Too much or too little of either of these two states (immunoreactive vs. tolerant) can serve as triggers and perpetuate diverse human diseases. Using novel computational approaches, we have charted a formal model for macrophage response to infections, and revealed hitherto unknown important genes that regulate the process of macrophage polarization; we plan to identify potential therapeutic targets that can reprogram macrophage response in disease states.",Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation,10100201,R01AI155696,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cancerous', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Eating', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Immunity', 'Noise', 'Nomenclature', 'Occupations', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TLR4 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'beneficial microorganism', 'body system', 'bone', 'cell type', 'chemical genetics', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gastrointestinal infection', 'genetic signature', 'human disease', 'human model', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,1000214,0.00899324843236012
"Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to build mathematical models of human innate immune responses to the global pathogen influenza virus A (IAV). To ensure successful replication, viral pathogens must simultaneously hijack several components of the host cell machinery while either evading or disabling innate cellular defenses. The host genetic background and subsequent viral and host signaling interactions dictate disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to mortality. Recent studies of IAV in genetically diverse murine models confirm the critical role of genotype in host response and outcome. Both molecular targets as well as key proteins involved in IAV pathogenesis could be therapeutically exploited to attenuate or prevent disease. Thus, we construct models of the molecular networks driving early innate IAV response that can be used to model genetic effects. Our experimental system is human lung epithelium, the first-line of defense against and target of IAV.  Aim 1. Genetic predictions from the gene regulatory network (GRN) governing human epithelial IAV response. GRNs describe the control of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs). We showed that integrating ATAC-seq with RNA-seq improves GRN accuracy. To construct a dynamic GRN in our heterogeneous lung tissue model, we propose scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements of IAV infection and IFNβ stimulation time courses. Our group recently discovered new mechanisms by which the IAV protein Ns1 drives promoter-independent transcriptional “read-through” and alters 3D-chromatin architecture. Thus, for modeling, we also measure genomic transcription initiation and promoter-capture Hi-C. Following experimental testing and GRN refinement, we will use a deep-learning model trained on DNA sequence and epigenetic data to provide inputs that enable dynamic GRN simulations for thousands of human genotypes. We will identify genetic risk loci and molecular mechanisms driving difference in gene expression responses across individuals.  Aim 2. Model the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and cellular signaling networks driving the innate immune response to IAV. We developed mutant influenza viruses, each encoding a FLAG-tagged viral protein, while maintaining virulence in vivo. We will use the mutant IAV to map host-virus PPIs in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung in vivo. Integrating with diverse ‘omics datasets, we will construct a molecular network model connecting virus-host PPIs through cellular signaling pathways to IAV-dependent TFs. We will test pathway reconstruction with epistasis mapping.  Completion of both aims will lead to a GRN spanning virus-host PPIs and cellular signaling to TF control of gene expression in an innate-immune cell type. Our experimental-computational design is widely applicable. This model, and its future adaptation to other cells, will help identify the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving diverse human IAV responses and the network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human response to Influenza virus infection varies dramatically between individuals, from mildly symptomatic to death. We will systematically measure and model the innate immune response to IAV at the molecular network level: from host-virus protein-protein interactions through cellular signal transduction to changes in gene expression in human cells. The resulting mathematical model will help identify network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy and help predict differences in IAV response in the human population.",Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus,9950738,U01AI150748,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza A virus', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon-beta', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Population', 'Prize', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Training', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immune response', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu', 'forest', 'global health', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'mathematical model', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk variant', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF', 'transcription termination', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,1202266,0.021289278532586255
"Hit-and-Run transcription: The impact of transient interactions in dynamic gene regulatory networks that mediate rapid nutrient signaling Project Summary: This grant exploits TIME - the 4th and largely unexplored dimension of transcription - to capture transient interactions in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that are important, but missed, in vivo. This is because genome- scale methods to capture transcription factor (TF) target interactions favor stable binding, and reporter gene studies which detect transient TF-target interactions in seconds, miss global responses needed for GRN models. We aim to fill the time-gap in our collective knowledge of dynamic GRNs by experimentally capturing transient TF-target interactions globally using a cell-based temporal TF perturbation assay (Aims 1 & 2), and evaluate their importance in forecasting gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3), a main goal of systems biology. We model temporal GRNs controlling nitrogen (N)-signaling in plants, but our approaches are broadly applicable. We exploit a cell-based assay for temporal TF perturbation, TARGET, which captures transient TF-target interactions genome-wide; i) by TF-mediated gene regulation even in the absence of detectable TF-binding, ii) within minutes of controlled TF nuclear entry, and iii) identifies highly transient TF-binding leading to sustained transcription by affinity-capture of de novo mRNAs. We discovered that i) a single TF can stably or transiently bind to, and induce or repress, distinct sets of targets depending on their cis-context, ii) that transient TF-targets captured only in cells control early N-responses in planta, for two master TFs in our GRNs (bZIP1 & NLP7). This genome-wide data supports a Hit-and-Run transcription model, where a TF Hit can initiate a stable transcriptional complex, including recruitment of TF partners, enabling transcription to continue after the initiating TF is no longer bound, the Run. This could allow a small number of TF molecules to rapidly affect a large number of target genes by acting catalytically. Our studies have been cited and influenced thinking of transient transcription mechanisms across yeast, stems cells, and were invoked to explain the new discovery of transient binding of Zelda/Bicoid to a reporter gene in Drosophila. Herein, we deploy experimental and computational innovations to test the pervasiveness and in vivo significance of a conceptual innovation - transient Hit-and- Run interactions in GRNs. Our experimental innovations include; i) Assays for Hit-and-Run activity across all 70 TF families in Arabidopsis, using a higher throughput version of the cell-based TARGET assay we recently published, ii) new methods to capture TF-target interactions using time-series biotin-ChIP and DamID, which leaves DNA methylation marks on transient TF-target interactions, supported by preliminary data (Aims 1 & 2). Our computational innovations include: i) ConnectTF, a platform to integrate TF-DNA binding and RNA-seq data and identify candidate Hit-and-Run TFs, and approaches to assess the in planta relevance of transient TF- target interactions in GRNs, such as ii) our newly published Network Walking method, and iii) OutPredict, a new time-based method to forecast gene expression at future time-points (Aim 3). Our experimental & computational approaches are broadly applicable and our results are relevant to environmental N-use affecting human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This work illustrates a combined experimental and computational approach to discover gene regulatory networks in a pathway, process, or trait - applied across a range of problems in biology, agriculture and medicine.

"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9938688,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,480000,0.026194075749691653
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution Abstract The nematode C. elegans is unique among model organisms in having a defined lineage and known connections for all its 302 neurons. The genome sequence was completed more than 20 years ago, but knowing which genes in the genome are used in exactly which cells and what transcription factors are controlling that expression remains a major challenge. We have successfully applied single cell- (sc-)RNA-seq methods to one larval stage and three embryonic stages to measure the RNA content of individual cells across the whole animal. We also have preliminary data that indicates that we can assay chromatin accessibility at the single cell level using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We now propose to collect both sc-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data at multiple stages to determine the gene expression patterns of each cell in the worm and the active regulatory sequence throughout the entire life cycle of C. elegans. In turn we will use the combined data sets along with chromatin- immunoprecipitation- (ChIP-) seq data to impute what transcription factors are controlling expression of each gene in the genome in every cell and what regulatory sequences these transcription factors recognize. The results will provide a valuable resource to scientists studying the worm and addresses a major outstanding question in the molecular biology of development. In addition, these data sets, from an animal with a “ground truth” should serve as a platform for methods development in the single cell field. Narrative The nematode C. elegans is a simple animal that as an adult has just 959 somatic cells that arise from a known and constant lineage. We propose to use single cell methods to measure in every cell the expression of each gene and the active regulatory regions throughout the life cycle. Using these data and others, we will impute how these regulatory regions and the transcription factors that bind to them control gene expression in each cell.",Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution,9969245,R01HG010478,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dissociation', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Larva', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Tissues', 'Transposase', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'cost effectiveness', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'male', 'method development', 'muscular system', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcription factor', 'young adult']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,510309,0.006382235304897395
"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin. Systematic definition of the regulatory DNA motif combinations in homeostasis and early cancer progression is designed to provide information to advance human health for skin and other tissues. 1",REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION,9873543,R01AR045192,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Future', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Ichthyoses', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-in', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'design', 'gene induction', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'keratinocyte differentiation', 'neural network algorithm', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'skin barrier', 'skin disorder', 'skin squamous cell carcinoma', 'transcription factor', 'tumor progression']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,504604,0.05342351995866323
"Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation Summary Transcription activation, a key step in gene control, is the readout of many signaling pathways controlling cell growth, development and stress response and defects in activation cause many human diseases and syndromes. Activation typically results from factors containing activation domains (ADs) binding to coactivator complexes containing activator binding domains (ABDs). Understanding the nature of ADs, the specificity of AD-coactivator interactions, and mechanisms of coactivator cooperativity are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms used by gene-specific activators and coactivators to regulate RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. The objectives of this proposal are to determine: i) mechanisms of Mediator recruitment and its interaction with ADs, ii) mechanisms of cooperativity between Mediator and the coactivator SAGA, and iii) what constitutes a functional AD and determines the AD specificity for different coactivators and promoter types. This work will utilize an interdisciplinary combination of biochemical, structural, molecular, and computational approaches to examine transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae. To understand these mechanisms, we will build upon several breakthrough concepts and methods developed in the past grant period. We will use a combination of genomics and biochemistry to identify a new mechanism of Mediator recruitment that is likely used at many genes. We will use orthogonal approaches to determine how the coactivator SAGA stimulates genome-wide transcription, either by direct interaction with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) and/or by direct interaction with Mediator. We will determine the structural basis for AD-Mediator Tail domain interaction using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis. Finally, we will use a combination of biochemistry, genomics, and computational analysis to predict AD function and specificity and identify new mechanisms of AD-coactivator interaction. The expected outcome of these studies will be a molecular understanding of transcription activator specificity and function, mechanisms used by the coactivators Mediator and SAGA to promote transcription, and an understanding of how these factors function at different classes of genes –a leap forward in understanding widely conserved mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Project Narrative Regulation of transcription by activation of gene expression is a key mechanism for control of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Defects in activation directly contribute to many human illnesses. Our proposed work will identify conserved and widely used mechanisms for transcriptional activation that will form the molecular basis for understanding regulation of transcriptional programs in normal cells, transcriptional defects leading to human disease, and reveal fundamental information on the mechanism of transcription factors that are the readout of many signaling pathways.",Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation,9968281,R01GM075114,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth and Development function', 'Housekeeping Gene', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Polymerase', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'SAGA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Activation Domain', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cell growth', 'chromatin modification', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein crosslink', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,527403,-0.008495949181928971
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates. These technologies are anticipated to have a major impact on the biomedical sciences, enabling the genome-wide interrogation of transcription during virtually any disease process for the first time.",Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq.,9850271,R01HG009309,"['Archives', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Polymerase I', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic tools', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scale up', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NHGRI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387500,0.030742066693606736
"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10032890,R01DK125562,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Base Sequence', 'Beds', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cleft Palate', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Mouse', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intracisternal A-Particle Elements', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Micronutrients', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrotransposon', 'Seminal', 'Supplementation', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'critical period', 'disorder risk', 'early pregnancy', 'embryo culture', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenetic variation', 'experimental study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolic phenotype', 'mother nutrition', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nonhuman primate', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'offspring', 'peripheral blood', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,500075,0.018024828330584323
"Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries PROJECT SUMMARY Short sequence elements in DNA and RNA determine the levels and composition of mRNAs and proteins, making it critical that we can accurately model how any given sequence will affect transcription, splicing or translation. Such models of cis-regulation will fill in gaps in our knowledge of these core gene expression processes. Additionally, as large numbers of human genomes are sequenced, the ability to predict the effects of sequence variation on the ultimate levels of proteins will be integral to the interpretation of variation in regulatory sequences. Similarly, the construction of metabolic pathways with defined levels of expression and the engineering of synthetic gene networks require accurate knowledge of how regulatory sequences affect expression. This application seeks to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case for learning how any short regulatory sequence affects protein levels. A predictive model will be trained on a set of libraries two orders of magnitude more complex than have been characterized to date. Libraries will be generated of a growth reporter gene with a million random sequences of 50 nucleotides that comprise either a DNA element that regulates transcription or an RNA element that regulates splicing or translation. The libraries will be transformed into yeast, and the yeast will be placed under selection such that they grow according to the ability of each random sequence to contribute to protein expression. A convolution neural network approach will be used to learn the relationship between these “fitness” phenotypes and their associated genotypes. Although yeast is a single-celled eukaryote, it has been the source of most of the original findings on gene expression, and these findings form the basis for much of our knowledge of more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, the short sequences in yeast that comprise the DNA- and RNA-binding sites of regulatory proteins tend to be comparable in size to those of other organisms. Yeast is used often in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and the work proposed here will result in novel tools for quantitatively controlling its gene expression. Initial results with a library of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicate that we can construct a model to account for a large fraction of the observed variability in expression, and that the model extends to native sequence elements. The model allowed us to forward engineer 5' UTRs to have increased activity. Specific aims of this application are to assess the effects of random sequences targeted to upstream regulatory elements, core promoter elements, 5' UTRs, introns and 3' UTRs; to learn predictive and interpretable models using convolutional neural networks and to identify novel functional cis-regulatory elements; and to validate our models on native sequences and combinatorial libraries, and by engineering synthetic sequence elements with user-specified properties. In sum, the proposal seeks to construct a comprehensive and predictive model of regulatory sequence–function relationships for a well-studied single- celled eukaryote, providing a basis for similar studies on other organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research seeks to generate a model for how regulatory sequences present in the genome of a simple organism affect the expression of a protein.

"Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development Abstract Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most commonly occurring human birth defects worldwide, with up to 200,000 children born every year with some type of craniofacial defect. These defects can occur as part of complex syndromes that involve multiple tissues and organs. The syndromic forms of these disorders have been successfully linked to nearly 500 genes including TWIST1 for craniosynostosis and IRF6 for orofacial clefting. However more frequently no other part of the body is directly involved (50% of craniosynostoses, 70% of orofacial clefts). Genome wide association studies indicate heritability for such defects, however the vast majority of associations fall outside of genes suggesting defective gene regulation is a major contributor to incidence of such defects. Gene regulatory elements can be located throughout the genome and typically have tissue-specific activity, making them difficult to identify and predict what gene they control. The overall objective of this application is to integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets from early human and mouse craniofacial development from our lab as well as FaceBase to comprehensively predict regulatory element-gene interactions. Our hypothesis posits that conserved regulatory networks between human and mouse are enriched for disease relevant biology. In Aim 1 we propose to systematically identify chromatin states in human from 4.5 to 8 weeks of gestation and in mouse from embryonic days 9.5 to 15.5. In Aim 2 we propose to identify genes that are coordinately regulated in both species across these developmental windows. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to integrate these two disparate network types to identify regulatory element-gene pairings. We will experimentally validate predicted interactions in a culture model of cranial neural crest cells using proximity-ligation coupled with immunoprecipitation. Our proposed studies will generate the most comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic networks in a developing human tissue and for the first time identify the conserved regulatory architecture for building the mammalian orofacial complex. Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in clefts of orofacial tissue are common birth defects affecting more than 1 in 1000 live births. The genetic causes of these defects have been difficult to determine, but all current evidence suggests defective gene regulation during embryonic development underlies these birth defects. This project seeks to identify regulatory networks that control gene expression during craniofacial development and are conserved between human and mouse.",Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development,9891599,R03DE028588,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body part', 'Cephalic', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coupled', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neural Crest Cell', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Syndrome', 'TWIST1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computational pipelines', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'differential expression', 'embryo tissue', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'falls', 'gene interaction', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'multiple omics', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'programs', 'promoter', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R03,2020,164000,0.021749098473259662
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,9996761,R01HG010045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enhancers', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'chromosome conformation capture', 'comparative', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genomic locus', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'markov model', 'multi-task learning', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'novel', 'promoter', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,352626,0.03840152318230345
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9931169,F30CA224687,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Relapse', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor Promoters', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States', 'Variant', 'X Inactivation', 'anticancer research', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'simulation', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,47730,0.04672705670188248
"Predictable control of gene regulation through epigenetic engineering PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Recent landmark discoveries have revealed that in addition to DNA lesions, epigenetic mechanisms also play a major role in cancer. Epigenetics is mediated in part by interactions of proteins and DNA that confer heritable gene expression states. Drugging the cancer epigenome is a burgeoning medical technology that currently uses small molecule inhibitors and small RNAs to disrupt hyperactive epigenetic enzymes. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that a new modality, fusion proteins that interact with the chromatin fiber, will activate therapeutic genes at sites that bear a specific pattern of cancer-related biochemical marks. The specific aims are to (2) use bioinformatic analyses to discover chromosome features that support inducible changes in gene expression states and (2) to use protein engineering to identify determinants of nuclear protein engagement.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods to reactivate dormant therapeutic genes in cancer cells are limited to inhibitors that bind epigenetic enzymes and other proteins.

"Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency Project Abstract Haploinsufficiency plays a crucial role in Neurofibromatosis (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder impacting over 120,000 individuals in the United States. Current therapeutic approaches focus on specific components of NF1 signaling, for example inhibiting MEK signaling pathways in tumors, thus failing to address the broad range of signaling and symptoms associated with NF1. Given that NF1 is characterized by both autosomal dominance and haploinsufficiency (lack of normal protein), upregulating protein expression of the remaining wild-type NF1 allele has the ability to compensate for loss of function from the mutant allele, thus alleviating a broad range of NF1 symptoms and overall disease progression. Infixion proposes to build a luciferase reporting assay to evaluate NF1 expression against known drugs, including 50+ compounds, across six drug classes, already identified by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression. By confirming that these candidate drugs activate NF1 transcription, increase NF1 protein expression, and normalize Ras pathway signaling in NF1 +/- Schwann cells, and by further screening libraries of known drugs for increased NF1 expression, we propose a novel path of NF1 drug discovery that will impact a broad range of NF1 patients and symptoms, in a preventative manner, and without regard to the wide spectrum of NF1 genetic mutations. Research Background. Increasing NF1 expression via transfection reverses abnormal Ras activation resulting from NF1 loss (Wallis, et al. 2018). Transcriptional activation in other genetic conditions such as Willams-Beuren Syndrome, and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis compensates for haploinsufficiency (Giordano, et al. 2012). Lastly, overcoming haploinsufficiency in another autosomal dominant condition (Sim1 induced obesity; mouse model) was recently shown using a Crispr/dCas9 transcriptional activator (Ahituv, et al. 2019). Specific Aims. 1) Construct a luciferase reporter assay engineered into the endogenous NF1 gene of a well characterized, publically available, immortalized NF1 +/- Schwann cell line (Wallace et al. 2016; data published at Synapse.org). Validate assay using a viral transcription factor developed by Infixion using Crispr/dCas9 to upregulate NF1. 2) Deploy this NF1 luciferase reporter assay to screen 50+ known drugs shown by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression across various cell/tissue types. Next, use this validated luciferase reporter to screen a 13,000+ compound repurposing library of known drugs available from Scripps Research Institute (known as ReFrame). 3) The top hits from Aim 2 screens will be evaluated, utilizing both immortalized and iPSC derived NF1+/- Schwann cells, for the following: a) ability to induce NF1 mRNA and protein expression, using qPCR and Westerns, b) the impact on Ras signaling (pERK, ELK-1, AKT, etc.) utilizing a targeted quantitative mass spec proteomics assay, c) their broader impact on gene expression in Schwann cells utilizing RNAseq, d) impact on cell proliferation, and e) their safety profile based on published data from previous trials. The goal is to prioritize not more than 3-5 candidates to take forward into a Phase 2 evaluation. Project Narrative Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that impacts an estimated 1 in 3000 people worldwide, and one that is characterized by a complex set of symptoms shown to be dependent on haploinsufficiency (i.e., the lack of normal protein). By upregulating NF1 protein expression from the normal allele by two-fold, and thus restoring normal levels of functional NF1 protein in tissues important in NF1, we target a range of NF1 symptoms by eliminating the haploinsufficient environment. We propose to develop and utilize NF1-specific luciferase reporter and proteomic assays, along with standard small molecule evaluation tools, to characterize a small molecule library of repurposed drugs for their ability to upregulate NF1 transcription, and to further evaluate the resulting impact of “hits” on NF1 protein expression, cell proliferation, gene expression specificity, as well as downstream pathways (such as Ras, MEK, mTOR) known to be dysregulated by mutations in the NF1 gene.",Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency,10010298,R43NS117234,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dominant Genetic Conditions', 'Drug Screening', 'ELK1 gene', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Luciferases', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modification', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Obese Mice', 'Orphan Drugs', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Regimen', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell', 'Supravalvular aortic stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcend', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Williams Syndrome', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'gene expression database', 'gene therapy', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Expression', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'phase 2 testing', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,"INFIXION BIOSCIENCE, INC.",R43,2020,299503,0.002182994271033533
"C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow committed to developing an academic research group focused on applying bioinformatics to understand the pathophysiology of alcohol-related liver diseases (ALD). His previous and current postdoctoral work has given him the unique skillset to answer questions involving gene expression/regulation in the immune system. The Career Development Plan describes 2 years of mentored research wherein the candidate will develop skills in clinical immunology, generate the sequencing data outlined in the proposal, and learn leadership skills to transition into independence. The next 3 years, after obtaining an independent faculty position, will be dedicated to developing new data analysis pipelines and establishing cell biological and bioinformatics tools to understand gene regulation in the innate immune system, which will allow the candidate to establish future projects in ALD immunology. Research Plan: ALD is a spectrum of disorders that affect a growing number of people worldwide. Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that can increase the morbidity and severity of ALD disorders. In AH, the innate immune system is hypersensitive to microbial byproducts. Alcohol consumption causes gut-barrier disruption, leading to leakage of gut microbes into the portal circulation. The liver immune system is able to detect these microbes through pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin receptors (CTLs). While TLRs have been well studied for their role in sensitizing the innate immune cells to microbial products, the CTLs have only recently been implicated in mouse models of ALD. CTLs are a large family of PRRs that sense a vast diversity of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our work has found that many members of the CTL gene family are upregulated in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of AH patients. CTLs were also upregulated in PBMCs in response to LPS/TLR4 signaling. We predict CTLs are upregulated in response to gut- derived LPS in order to increase sensing for other microbes that may be present in the blood, making this pathway a secondary innate immune surveillance pathway. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in three aims to address the functional role and regulation of this immune surveillance pathway, and the mechanism by which it is exacerbated in AH. First, we will use PBMCs isolated from AH patients to measure increased sensitivity to CTL agonists, as well as micro-/mycobiome sequencing to determine what microbial byproducts were in circulation in patients. Second, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the different monocyte subclasses, variation in CTL expression, and how different cell types respond to CTL agonists. Third, because CTL genes are clustered in the genome, we will use scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) to understand co-regulation of nearby genes in the genome. Altogether, this proposal will further our understanding of CTL mediated immune surveillance in host/microbial interactions during AH disease progression and potentially identify new therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that causes significant mortality among patients with Alcohol-related liver disease. In this project, we will investigate how the innate immune system and the micro- and myco-biome interact via a family of genes called the C-type lectin receptors (CTLs) to increase inflammation and disease severity among AH patients. The results of this project will expand our understanding of CTLs and immune surveillance, and provide new therapeutic targets for treatment of AH.",C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD,10020883,K99AA028048,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcohols', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'C Type Lectin Receptors', 'C-Type Lectins', 'CD14 gene', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Immunology', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elements', 'Ethanol Metabolism', 'Extravasation', 'FCGR3B gene', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Fungal Components', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunology', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myelogenous', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'TLR4 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toll-like receptors', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transposase', 'Up-Regulation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cytokine', 'data analysis pipeline', 'dectin 1', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fungus', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'immunological diversity', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory milieu', 'liver inflammation', 'liver injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'mouse dectin-2', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'prevent', 'receptor expression', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIAAA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K99,2020,123096,0.0036245525364677535
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth in patients with refractory PA disease.",DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth,9999533,R01CA230328,"['Acromegaly', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dura Mater', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hypopituitarism', 'In Vitro', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Pituitary-dependent Cushing&apos', 's disease', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Publishing Peer Reviews', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Somatotropin', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'bone', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional status', 'genome-wide', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'methylome', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision drugs', 'prognostic', 'small hairpin RNA', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,525099,0.006404651288611699
