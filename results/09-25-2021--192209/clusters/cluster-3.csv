"Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary adult brain tumor with an incidence rate of 3.2 per 100,000 people. Due to its heterogeneous genetic characteristics, GBM carries a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of only 14 months and five-year survival rates are less than 10%. The current standard of care is maximal safe surgical resection, chemoradiation, and adjuvant temozolomide. Within the natural history of GBM, there are adaptive genetic changes within the tumor that lead to treatment resistance and inevitable recurrence, leading to patient death. While a variety of treatments can be administered for tumor recurrence, there is currently no consensus on therapy for recurrent tumor as none have been proven to provide substantial survival benefit. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. Rather, clinical decision-making is based on a manual and variable two- dimensional measure of tumor burden, a surrogate of tumor volume, and genetic characterization of select molecular markers at the time of initial surgery. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care. Thus, a critical need exists for automatic methods that non-invasively evaluate treatment efficacy on a patient-to-patient basis. To address this problem, we will develop a novel solution based on deep learning that leverages structural, diffusion, and perfusion information from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging. At the core of our solution is a convolutional neural network; a machine learning technique that can be trained on raw image data to predict clinical outputs of interest. Firstly, we will develop a fully automatic technique for longitudinal tracking of tumor volumes. To do this, we will develop novel deep learning architectures through incorporation of state-of-the-art neural network components that can segment both whole tumor and tumor subregions (edema, non-enhancing tumor, and gadolinium contrast-enhancing tumor). To prove algorithm utility, we will automatically derive tumor volumes in a longitudinal patient cohort and correlate volumes with clinical outcomes. Secondly, we will develop a non-invasive, deep learning algorithm for evaluation of regional genetic characteristics of GBM. To train this algorithm, we will acquire imaging-localized surgical biopsies and genetic profiling of GBM patients undergoing surgery. Once trained, the algorithm can be used to non- invasively identify clonal populations and track genetic changes associated with clinical outcomes during the course of treatment. The development of these deep learning algorithms will transform physician’s capacity for clinical decision-making and dramatically improve outcomes for a devastating disease. Project Narrative The proposed research will provide automatic deep-learning tools to aid clinical decision-making for glioblastoma, the most common primary adult brain tumor that carries a dismal prognosis. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care and enhancement of clinical outcomes.",Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma,9760521,F30CA239407,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Glioblastoma', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perfusion Weighted MRI', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Radiogenomics', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Woman', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'career', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'genetic profiling', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'molecular marker', 'mutational status', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'standard of care', 'temozolomide', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'two-dimensional']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F30,2019,44949,0.08745940599134949
"Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one heterogeneous type of cancer affecting most organ systems. NETs must be correctly graded to ensure proper treatment and patient management. The proliferation index, as measured by Ki67 nuclear staining, is required for gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic NET grading per the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Measuring the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) from pathology images requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This process is an essential procedure in basic, translational and clinical research and in routine clinical practice. However, current Ki67 image analysis tools have a number of drawbacks: 1) Ki67 LI assessment is still mainly achieved with manual or semi-automated methods, leading to increased labor costs, awkward workflows, low-throughput image analysis and significant potential inter- and intra-observer variability; 2) computer-aided Ki67 counting is error-prone due to the multi-stage image processing design, where each stage itself is a very challenging task; 3) current algorithm design does not take into consideration the characteristics of Ki67 images such that it has technical difficulty in classifying different types of cells in Ki67 stained images. In this proposed research, we seek to develop and disseminate a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, KiNeT, specifically for better automated Ki67 LI measurement in GI and pancreatic NETs. KiNet will take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs), to develop an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel model for single-stage Ki67 LI assessment. To this end, we will first formulate Ki67 counting as a cell identification problem and solve it using class-aware structured regression modeling within a novel FCN network. This network will simultaneously detect and classify immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. Next, we will further enhance cell identification with another related task, extraction of regions of interest (ROIs), which will differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions by taking Ki67 image characteristics into consideration. These two tasks will be unified into one single neural network and jointly learned to benefit both cell identification and region classification. KiNet will provide a novel computational method for accurate Ki67 LI assessment, thereby enabling early detection and targeted treatments of the diseases. Compared to manual counting and current Ki67 image analysis methods, it will significantly improve the objectivity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility and efficiency. Additionally, the proposed single-stage Ki67 counting strategy, which is completely different from current multi-stage Ki67 image analysis pipelines, will provide a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ki67 labeling index (LI) is a reliable and critical biomarker to grade gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This biomarker computation requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This proposed research is to develop and disseminate a novel advanced machine learning-based imaging informatics system to better quantify Ki67 images for effective and efficient single-stage Ki67 LI assessment for GI and pancreatic NETs.",Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors,9722699,R21CA237493,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Islet Cell Tumor', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Nuclear', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Siblings', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multi-task learning', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2019,169106,0.08070314939573255
"Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials Project Summary / Abstract In patients with lymphomas and other cancers, quantitative evaluation of the extent of tumor burden is im- portant for staging, restaging, and assessment of therapeutic response or relapse; yet measurement of overall tumor burden is challenging with current tools, particularly when lymph nodes are confluent or difficult to fully differentiate from surrounding structures. Precision medicine and novel therapeutics are emphasizing the need to introduce a risk-adapted approach to tailor appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients. The ability to quantitatively assess cancer phenotypes with functional and anatomical imaging that could efficiently and ac- curately map patients to gene expression profiling, clinical information, matching cohorts, and novel treatment regimens could potentially result in more optimal management of patients with cancer.  This Academic-Industry Partnership aims to translate recently developed technologies for semi- automated image segmentation and quantification of lymph nodes into robust tools and integrate them into an existing cloud-based system for management of multicenter oncology clinical trials. The ability to semi- automatically segment lymph node pathology with computed tomography (CT), as well as quantify nodal me- tabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) will enable comprehensive tracking of morphological and functional changes related to disease progression and treatment response.  Since 2004, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) has developed the Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC (PIM) platform to manage clinical trial image assessment workflows. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 consistently measured lymph node measurements in the TIMC database. The PIM system is used to make over 20,000 time point imaging assessments per year at eight NCI- designated Cancer Centers and aims to grow quickly by transitioning to a fully cloud-hosted system.  Given sufficient training data, state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technolo- gies can meet or even exceed human performance on specific imaging analysis tasks. Recent studies have indicated that AI-based lymph node segmentation from CT scans is nearing human performance levels, and we will extend and translate this work into a commercial tool. Specifically, our aim is to translate recent ad- vancements in AI-based segmentation into deployable services, and integrate these services into the clinical trial workflow. The proposed system will be designed to incorporate expert feedback provided by image ana- lysts and radiologists back into the ground truth dataset, allowing for continuous improvement in accuracy and clinical acceptance. We will extend our semi-automatic CT segmentation technologies to quantify lymph node metabolism in PET/CT, using lymphoma as the model disease. Integration of these technologies with PIM will provide an ongoing source of consistently measured quantitative data across a network of cancer centers. Project Narrative Advanced quantitative imaging is underutilized in oncologic clinical practice and research because the time investment entailed in manual lesion segmentation remains prohibitive. This partnership proposes to integrate machine learning based quantitative imaging tools into the existing Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC clinical trial image management system. We will use data from the centralized Tumor Imaging Metrics Core at the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to produce ground truth training data and develop semi-automated multimodali- ty lesion analysis for patients with cancer.",Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials,9817851,R01CA235589,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Goals', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Services', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Burden', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'glucose metabolism', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'lymph nodes', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'success', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,683973,0.030976159914686354
"Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response Abstract  The continuing goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective imaging-based strategies to personalize brain tumor treatment. Current Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria, which incorporate anatomic imaging only, are insufficient for distinguishing tumor from treatment effect (TE). Without definitive confirmation of tumor progression, no treatment changes are recommended for several months after standard therapies. Thus, patients are precluded from switching to potentially more effective therapies—a limitation that could be overcome with more reliable imaging techniques.  To this end, during the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated the feasibility of several quantitative imaging (QI) tools to reliably distinguish tumor from treatment effect and predict treatment response. These QI tools include a machine-learning approach to calibrate T1w images enabling the creation of quantitative delta T1 (qDT1) maps. The qDT1 enable the detection of true contrast enhancing lesion volume (CELV). The qDT1 together with our proven dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI methods, for determination of rCBV (relative cerebral blood volume), are used to generate a new biomarker, fractional tumor burden (FTB), to delineate the extent of tumor within CELV on a voxel-wise basis. These perfusion-based QI tools in combination with our diffusion MRI technology, which includes functional diffusion maps (FDMs) and more recently RSI (restriction spectrum imaging), provide a comprehensive assessment of brain tumor and its distinction from treatment effect.  Now, in order to translate this technology for use in clinical trials and daily practice, some final updates and clinical validation studies are needed as proposed here. First, to ease adoption and testing in the clinical setting improvements are proposed for the individual QI technologies along with the development of a streamlined workflow (Aim 1). To improve the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI and FTB biomarker, studies will be performed to confirm that a single-dose DSC-MRI method can replace the standard double-dose method without affecting the accuracy of rCBV or the creation of FTB maps (Aim 1.1). Also, registration and segmentation algorithms will be updated to include deformable registration and recent advances in deep learning for longitudinal reporting of CELV, non-enhancing lesion volumes (NELV) and each of the QI metrics (Aim 1.2). Finally, a streamlined workflow that incorporates these improvements will be created (Aim 1.3). The Aim 2 studies will test the QI tools and workflow using clinical trial data (Aim 2.1-2.2) and daily clinical practice (Aim 2.3-2.4).  Clinical validation of this new QI-RANO workflow, with evidence showing improved prediction in comparison to current measures, has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how brain tumor burden is assessed. Project Narrative The goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective quantitative imaging (QI)-based strategies to provide earlier indications of brain tumor treatment response than is currently available. The QI tools, which include novel quantitative measures of enhancing lesion (qDT1), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), fractional tumor burden (FTB) and functional diffusion maps (fDM) will be updated and validated in the context of clinical trials. Working in close collaboration with an industrial partner, the proven methods will be translated into a software platform for widespread use within the quantitative imaging network (QIN), and for both clinical trials and daily standard of care.",Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response,9781262,U01CA176110,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Update', 'Validation', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cerebral blood volume', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'validation studies']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,U01,2019,584330,0.05927080756655093
"Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors Abstract Solid tumors are comprise the large majority of cancers (>90%). Standard of diagnosis and care often involved serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors. The long-term goal of this project is to provide computation tools for understanding the histopathologic variation of solid tumors and aid the development of image guided therapies for individualizing solid tumor treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging and that they can contribute towards the development of adaptive radiation therapy (ART). Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the development of fast and accurate computational tools for using MR image guided radiation therapy in clinical settings. Project Narrative The proposal aims to advance our current understanding of the association of malignant solid tumors at the cellular level. We plan to develop fast computational tools for real time image guided radiation, personalized to individual variations in cancer patients. Overall, this will help improve cancer diagnosis and treatment by better differentiation between healthy and aggressive cancer tissue, and by improved precision for targeted therapy.",Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors,9771401,R21CA231892,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian learning', 'Brain', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'feature detection', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'individual variation', 'individualized medicine', 'learning algorithm', 'member', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel architecture', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive tools', 'real-time images', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2019,194940,0.031193739998026087
"Quantitative Image Modeling for Brain Tumor Analysis and Tracking Project Summary Differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation-induced necrosis (RN) is a critical step in the follow-up management of patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery for brain tumor. A non-invasive method that is robust in discriminating RN from recurrent tumor using non-invasive method such as MRI is of a significant value for patients and physicians. The hypothesis of this proposed project is that advanced Machine-learning (ML) and image analysis of different MRI imaging information may hold potential for accurately detecting the difference between RN and recurrence of brain tumor is a substantial challenge in the daily practice in Neuro-Oncology. Furthermore, there is a need to study feasibility of translating our ongoing works in brain tumor volume quantitation into potential imaging device. Consequently, this Administrative Supplement propose the following Specific Aims for this study: Aim 1: To develop novel methods to discriminate RN from tumor recurrence in MRI. Aim 2: To develop and prepare a fast track SBIR proposal (Phase I and II combined) to be submitted soon after this Administrative Supplemental funding expires. If successful, robust discrimination of radiation-induced RN and tumor recurrence will make our current brain tumor and abnormal tissue volume segmentation methods and tools more robust and ready for use in the radiology and oncology practices. Furthermore, the planned SBIR project funding will lead the way to fully explore the possibility of launching a commercial software technology for brain tumor volume quantitation imaging device development.

"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,9707393,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,313021,0.011874339574304069
"Development of a High-Throughput Three-Dimensional H&E Platform for the Characterization of Breast Cancer Biopsies PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this project is to develop a prognostic imaging tool for breast cancer that can be used to predict specific clinical outcomes such as tumor reoccurrence and drug resistance based upon a tumor’s histomorphology features. The current histopathology paradigm for evaluating tissues is focused on diagnosing disease wherein these same tissues if evaluated in their entirety and digitized, provide an opportunity to correlate clinical outcomes to specific tissue features. Through this project, we are developing a high- throughput breast tumor imaging approach that is capable of imaging breast tumor tissue in its entirety and generating virtual H&E optical Z sections in 3D of equivalent quality to traditional H&E sections so that all of the cells within a biopsy are characterized. To achieve this objective, we are combining our patented tissue clearing approach with fluorescent labeling, high-content confocal microscopy and an unbiased machine learning approach. This approach allows for biopsies to be digitized in their entirety and for all of the features and heterogeneity of tumors to be assessed instead of just looking at a few ultra-thin 2D slides. Through the combination of this unique imaging approach with hierarchical agglomerative clustering, specific histomorphological features can be correlated to clinical outcomes using a detailed sample library with corresponding clinical outcome data. The main objectives of this project are to 1) develop a robust 3D H&E labeling approach, 2) demonstrate that tissues can be imaged in 3D using a fluorescent approach to generate “H&E-like” images of equivalent quality to traditional H&E and 3) show that this tissue analysis approach can be transferred to an automated high- content confocal microscope. Additionally, we will show the ability to cluster tissues based on their histomorphological features and will with a small data set of 34 breast tumor biopsies show how these features are correlated to clinical outcomes. If successful, we will develop this proof-of-concept into a robust CLIA 21 CFR Part 11 compliant assay that complies with the ICH guidelines for analytical assays. This assay would ultimately allow clinicians to better predict how a tumor will respond to certain treatments and best tailor a treatment for a specific patient. This type of precision medicine approach will lead to improved patient outcomes and a more efficacious treatment regimen. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop a prognostic imaging tool for breast cancer that evaluates breast tumor tissues in their entirety in 3D and uses a machine learning based approach to predict specific clinical outcomes such as tumor reoccurrence and drug resistance.

"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term.

Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery. This project aims to develop a novel tool based on stimulated Raman microscopy to image fresh brain tissue in a label-free manner, providing comparable histological information to conventional H&E staining, to guide brain tumor resection in real time in the operating room.",Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery,9724467,R00EB020749,"['Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atypia', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophotonics', 'Biophysics', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Density', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Fine-needle biopsy', 'Frequencies', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Skill', 'Linear Algebra', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronavigation', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Online Systems', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical Injuries', 'Surgical Oncology', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Step', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'chemical bond', 'chemical group', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'computer science', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'frontier', 'gray matter', 'human disease', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'meningioma', 'microscopic imaging', 'mouse model', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'peer', 'preservation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'standard care', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vibration', 'white matter']",NIBIB,"STATE UNIVERSITY OF NY,BINGHAMTON",R00,2019,243484,0.06230902506765003
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry. This new technology will contribute to understanding complex processes in biological tissues that play a role in both health and disease.",Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry,9782980,UG3HL145593,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Blood capillaries', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Ensure', 'Glass', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slide', 'Solvents', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated analysis', 'biological systems', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'interest', 'ionization technique', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'nano', 'nanoprobe', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'preservation', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'scale up', 'tool']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,UG3,2019,375000,-0.005006738593838642
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9743107,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'random forest', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,605394,0.10689740792152955
"Radiogenomics framework for non-invasive personalized medicine Project summary Radiogenomics, is a burgeoning area of research that aims to link medical imaging with multi-omics molecular profiles of the same patients. Radiogenoimcs has shown its potential through its ability to predict clinical outcomes e.g. prognosis, and through predicting actionable molecular properties of tumors, e.g. the activity of EGFR, a major drug target in many cancers. The typical imaging genomics workflow consists of the following steps: (1) Identify the tumor through segmentation. This is often also defined as identifying Regions Of Interests or ROIs through a manual process with a radiologist or using computer vision algorithms. (2) Feature extraction, often also known as radiomics, whereby 100s of features are identified that capture the shape, the texture and the intensity distributions of lesions in 2D or 3D. (3) Supervised machine learning to predict clinical outcomes such as prognosis, overall survival or response to treatment, or predicting molecular profiles such as gene expression patterns or metagenes, or individual molecular properties such as the mutation status of a gene (e.g. EGFR). This workflow has been demonstrated in several cancers including lung cancer, brain tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer etc. Current radiogenomics applications are limited to study associations between imaging and molecular data, and predicting long term outcomes. However, no actionable information is gained from radiogenomics maps. In this renewal, we propose to develop a radiogenomics framework to support treatment response, treatment allocation and treatment monitoring: (1) we will develop informatics algorithms that integrate radiogenomic data for treatment response, (2) algorithms that allow combining radiogenomic data during treatment follow-up, and (3) algorithms that use the radiogenomic map to suggest novel drugs and predict drug target activities. Combining these complementary data sources in a radiogenomics framework for data fusion can have profound contributions toward predicting treatment outcomes by uncovering unknown synergies and relationships. More specifically, developing computational models integrating quantitative image features and molecular data to develop radiogenomics signatures, holds the potential to translate in benefit to tumor patients by investigating biomarkers that accurately predict therapy response of tumors. Readily, because medical imaging is part of the routine diagnostic work-up of cancer patients and molecular data of human tumors is increasingly being used in clinical workflows, therefore if reliable radiogenomic signatures can be found reflecting treatment response, translation to the clinical applications is feasible. Narrative We proposed a radiogenomics framework for treatment allocation, treatment follow-up and treatment monitoring to provide precision medicine for cancer patients. We will develop informatics methods integrating clinical, molecular and imaging data for therapeutic purposes. We will focus on the development of radiogenomic signatures that are predictive of treatment response, actionable and suggest the use of novel drugs.",Radiogenomics framework for non-invasive personalized medicine,10005534,R56EB020527,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Eye', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Radiogenomics', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'cancer site', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'human data', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'mutational status', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive signature', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2019,444001,0.028719444226096555
"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9788340,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'actionable mutation', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2019,228089,0.07473717221739971
"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration. These features are not well recapitulated by the current biomarkers in use in the clinic, majority of them are DNA based mutation assays. RNA expression patterns have been described by various investigators and may more fully recapitulate tumor biology. The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay.

"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution.

"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites.

"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs.

"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9753130,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'feature detection', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,567509,0.03316682023918468
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9665259,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'experimental arm', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'secondary endpoint', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,471560,0.08714916535758481
"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. The functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist.",High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors,9647173,K22CA234406,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR screen', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Faculty', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guide RNA', 'Heterogeneity', 'K22 Award', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer cell line', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug development', 'druggable target', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'homologous recombination', 'individual patient', 'irinotecan', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'mouse model', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oxaliplatin', 'precision oncology', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'targeted agent', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K22,2019,192240,0.0380732154419153
"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer",9699454,U01CA225431,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cetuximab', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunotherapy', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'drug discovery', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genomic signature', 'image archival system', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'mutant', 'mutational status', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2019,601400,0.03664708338003332
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9765042,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,530736,0.049688892936678206
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform.

"Cloud quantitative imaging for whole-body tumor burden in neurofibromatoses Project Summary / Abstract The neurofibromatoses (NFs), including NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis, are a group of autosomal-dominant neurogenetic disorders characterized by a predisposition in virtually 100% of patients to develop multiple nerve sheath tumors. The determination of tumor burden on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indispensable for the longitudinal management of NF patients, which includes life-long follow-up for the monitoring of tumor progression and the assessment of treatment response. However, volumetric quantification of NF tumors is not a clinical routine because of the technical challenges in the accurate and reproducible segmentation of highly-irregular and infiltrating NF tumors, in particular plexiform neurofibromas on MRI. The goal of this STTR project is to develop cloud quantitative imaging (CQI) for NF software, denoted as CQI-NF, which will provide the technical and clinical service for volumetric quantification of NF tumors on whole-body and regional MRI via ""virtualization"" (cloud computing) technology. The product developed in this STTR will provide access to this technology for the NF clinical community nationwide and worldwide without the excessive cost to maintain on-site advanced volumetric imaging analysis software and hardware. This project will be built upon existing technologies for volumetric imaging analysis developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using 200 longitudinal whole-body and regional MRI cases collected from the NF community worldwide. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of CQI-NF system: We will continue to develop the CQI-NF system prototyped in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy and efficiency of segmentation by paralleling dynamic-threshold level set (DT level set) in multi-server platform, combining deep-learning in DT level set for the segmentation of NF tumors, and to translate the CQI-NF system from 3DQI/NF into a private cloud platform (such as TeraRecon's iNtuition CLOUD) for the provision of volumetric quantification of NF using a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model in the NF community. (2) Evaluation of CQI-NF system: We will conduct a retrospective clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of the CQI-NF system in the longitudinal monitoring of 200 NF patients collected at MGH Cancer Center and our clinical collaborators worldwide in the NF community. (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for CQI-NF to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of CQI-NF. The successful development and validation of the proposed CQI-NF system will have a high clinical impact in the NF community by providing a cloud-computing infrastructure for the volumetric imaging analysis of NF on MRI, which is not available in current clinical routine, thereby leading to a substantial advance in the longitudinal management of NF patients. Project Narrative The determination of whole-body tumor burden is indispensable for the management of neurofibromatosis (NF) patients, which includes life-long follow-up for the monitoring of tumor progression and assessment of treatment response. This STTR phase II project continues to develop the cloud quantitative imaging for NF (CQI-NF) software that was prototyped in Phase I based on the core technology developed at the MGH 3D Imaging Lab.

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9759874,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2019,399937,0.03403130637469041

"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents.

"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy,9713119,R01CA237210,"['Antibodies', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granzyme', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Inflammatory', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Peptidyltransferase', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Recombinants', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Protease', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'humanized mouse', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'oncology', 'perforin', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'pharmacodynamic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'resistance mechanism', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sortase', 'success', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,341598,0.04350047255321335
"A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials Project Summary/Abstract There has been a shift to greater use of neadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the clinical management of cancer. Often used in breast cancer to provide systemic treatment for possible or apparent metastatic disease, NACT also reduces the primary tumor size and facilitates breast conservation. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is an effective diagnostic for monitoring tumor regression. There are many methodologies being developed for monitoring cancer in vivo, including contrast agent washout, volumetry, and more recently correlating apparent diffusion coefficients and proton relaxation times to tumor staging. Such imaging biomarkers are predictive of the pathological complete response (pCR) outcome prior to surgery. This enables physicians to provide “evidence based” treatment modifications to reduce deleterious side effects and improve patient outcomes. To obtain quantitative data from MR images, the variations that occur in imaging as a result of hardware and software differences between MRI manufacturers and day-to-day operations must be quantified. In MRI, the data depends on the protocols used to acquire the image, resulting in inconsistencies if even one parameter in the protocol changes. The goal of the proposed work is to produce and develop and disseminate a ground truth physical standard and quality control program for comparison of MRI scanners in the multisite I-SPY2 (ACRIN 6698) trials monitoring pre-operative chemotherapy treatments in the reduction of tumor size. The physical standard is an anthropomorphic breast phantom capable of fitting into all commercial breast coils. It contains novel human tissue mimics and geometric standards with values traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Analysis software capable of protocol compliance checks, rapid identification of the regions of interest, and comparison to ground truth values as measured by NIST will be developed to complement the physical standard. This will enable qualification of sites and quantification of error resulting from scanner performance alone. Given the wide breadth of parameter space that MRI protocols encompass, part of the proposed effort will include the development of protocols specific to image acquisition of tumor volumes and for measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient within the tumor volumes as compared to surrounding healthy tissue. Project Narrative: Quantitative imaging complements precision medicine initiatives by providing a noninvasive method of monitoring gene specific in vivo treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to neurological disorders. To realize quantitative imaging, variations in imaging hardware, software, and procedures must be mitigated. This project will develop a quality assurance and quality control procedure for multisite clinical trials involved in monitoring therapeutic efficacy using MR breast imaging.",A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials,10007270,R44CA235820,"['Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Breast conservation', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diffusion', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Volume', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cloud based', 'computer aided detection', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'human tissue', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'nervous system disorder', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'operation', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'side effect', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,"CALIBERMRI, INC.",R44,2019,843717,0.0034412638452884286
"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9840425,R01CA234557,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow', 'COL1A2 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cancer Patient', 'Castration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Indolent', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'androgen sensitive', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'cell stroma', 'clinically significant', 'conditioning', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome editing', 'host neoplasm interaction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intercellular communication', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'molecular oncology', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'oncology', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer metastasis', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'response', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,496626,-0.033828223184529556
"Deciphering the System-Wide Immune Response to Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, resulting in dramatic anti-tumor responses in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% show any survival benefit, and of these it is not clear what predicts response. ICIs have been thought to work primarily through reactivation of exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CD8s) residing within the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. Recent work, however, indicates that various CD4+ T cell populations outside the tumor microenvironment (peripheral immune system) likely play critical roles in carrying out anti-tumor immune responses. Given increasing evidence that immune cells other than CD8s are important for anti-tumor immunity, it is critical to identify and characterize these cells in order to understand their roles during HNSCC tumorigenesis and ICI therapy, which are currently unknown. This proposal by Dr. Kyle Jones, DDS, PhD seeks to significantly advance our understanding of cancer immunology in the context of HNSCC tumors, with the ultimate goal of improving existing ICI therapies and developing new treatment strategies. With the assistance of a multi-disciplinary mentoring team, he will use a novel systems biology approach to accomplish the following Aims: (AIM 1) Quantify the effects that HNSCC tumors have on systemic immunity and determine if these changes are conserved across tumor, blood, and regional lymph nodes; (AIM 2) Determine how the ICI atezolizumab alters the intratumoral and peripheral immune states of HNSCC patients and if these changes are associated with tumor response to therapy. These Aims will define how HNSCC tumors alter the composition and function of patients' immune systems at single cell and systems levels as well as identify/characterize the specific immune cells that contribute to anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones will use high throughput single-cell methods such as mass cytometry, multiplexed ion beam imaging, and single-cell RNAseq along with established analytic pipelines on HNSCC patient specimens obtained before and after ICI therapy. The innovation of this approach, which permits simultaneous study of all immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, will reveal how changes in any individual immune cell population affects the overall immune state. It will also be important for the discovery of additional immune cell populations and biomarkers associated with HNSCC anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones's long-term career goal is to become an expert, leader, and independent translational scientist in the fields of head and neck cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Through this K23 award, he will obtain the additional training in experimental immunology, single cell analysis methods, computer programming, advanced statistical methods, and career development he needs to successfully achieve this goal.

"The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration ABSTRACT: Accurate segmentation of solid tumors is challenging, due to their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location, as well as their appearance variation caused by the diversity of medical imaging. Manual annotation is tedious, prone to misinterpretation, human error, and observer bias. All these factors hinder further image analysis towards understanding tumor radio-phenotypes, predicting clinical outcomes, and monitoring progression patterns. Computational competitions have been seeking optimal advanced computational segmentation algorithms (ACSAs) for specific abnormalities, by pooling multi-institutional data together and benchmarking ACSAs from international groups. Along these lines, we have been successfully leading the organization of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, since 2012, towards a publicly-available pooled dataset of 542 multi-parametric MRI scans of glioma patients from 19 institutions. In the summarized analysis of all BraTS results, we have shown that although individual ACSAs do not outperform the gold standard agreement across expert clinicians, their fusion does outperform it, in terms of both accuracy and consistency across subjects. Towards the wider application of these ACSAs, in 2017 we created the BraTS algorithmic repository to make available Docker containers of individual ACSAs, created by BraTS participants. However, fusion of these ACSAs is still out of reach for clinical researchers, as there is no graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate it, and execution of such algorithms requires substantial computational background by the user. Furthermore, although competitions such as BraTS have shown promise, they cannot easily scale due to the requirement of pooling patient data from multiple institutions to a single location, that often faces legal, privacy, and data-ownership concerns. These concerns motivate distributed learning solutions, where the data are always retained within their institutions. We have been investigating such solutions to avoid the current paradigm of multi-institutional collaboration, i.e., data-sharing, and considering their potential multi-institutional adoption, with respect to privacy, scalability, and performance, we found federated learning (FL) to be most appropriate. In FL, each institution trains a model and shares it (without patient data) with an aggregation server, which then integrates institutional models in parallel and distributes back a consensus model. In this proposal, we focus on developing the open- source Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform, which with a user-friendly GUI will aim at i) bringing pre- trained models of various ACSAs and their fusion closer to clinical experts, and ii) allowing secure multi- institutional collaborations via FL to improve these pre-trained models without sharing patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges. Successful completion of this project will lead to an easy-to-use potentially-translatable tool enabling easy, fast, objective, repeatable and accurate tumor segmentation, without requiring a computational background by the user, and while facilitating further analysis of tumor radio-phenotypes towards accelerating discovery. NARRATIVE: Successful completion of this project will lead to a clinically translatable, easy-to-use software tool that offers a) pre-trained tumor segmentation models and their fusion, to perform better than experts, and b) a federated learning framework facilitating secure multi-institutional collaborations to improve these pre-trained models without the need to share patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges, towards accelerating research of cancer radio-phenotypes.",The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration,9826761,U01CA242871,"['Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Docking', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Observer Variation', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Radio', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'contrast enhanced', 'graphical user interface', 'human error', 'improved', 'interactive tool', 'light weight', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U01,2019,378519,0.047729257432494926
"Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tissue based cancer research and therapy development are significantly challenged by strong tumor heterogeneity, biased information derived from two-dimensional tissue sections, spatially distorted genetic biomarker profiles in tissue space, and lack of dynamic Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) characterizations, presenting a serious barrier to enhance cancer research and treatment. Informatics tools for three- dimensional (3D) digital pathology imaging data capturing both histology hallmarks and molecular biomarkers from both static and dynamic environments are promising to create longitudinal human tumor atlas, necessary for in-depth TME and its progression study. We, therefore, propose to create a scalable and effective 3D digital pathology analytics framework for large-scale 3D pathology imaging data, providing novel and accessible methods on pathology image integration, analysis, visualization, and 3D spatial pathology/biomarker data query for efficient test and discovery of spatial interactions of 3D pathology and biomarker objects in cancer research and targeted therapy development.",Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,9827695,U01CA242936,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Online Systems', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'web app']",NCI,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,392987,0.03503244214227041
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery.

"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9646469,K08CA234458,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'actionable mutation', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2018,68267,0.07473717221739971
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE MODELING FOR BRAIN TUMOR ANALYSIS AND TRACKING MRI images have been used for a wide variety of medical applications for a long time because they are safe and highly sensitive at detecting of tissue abnormalities that indicate cancer. MRI is generated by measuring the response of tissue components to a magnetic field. Also, based on the published statistics, brain tumor is one of the most common causes of death and early detection and monitoring is crucial for treatment. Literature and market review suggests that although extensive research exists on brain tumor detection using MRI images, MRI–based systems designed for brain tumor detection that have ultimate clinical value and use are lacking. Accordingly, we propose a new software technology that effectively detect, segment, classify and monitor brain tumor in MRI images. There have been extensive efforts on brain tumor detection in MR images because early detection has been always crucial for success of treatment. For ongoing work in our parent RO1 grant we are developing new machine learning and image analysis methods that for automatic detection and segmentation of brain tumor in MRI images, which is expected to help patients to have a much better chance of successful treatment.

"Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors Abstract Solid tumors are comprise the large majority of cancers (>90%). Standard of diagnosis and care often involved serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response.

"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration. These features are not well recapitulated by the current biomarkers in use in the clinic, majority of them are DNA based mutation assays. RNA expression patterns have been described by various investigators and may more fully recapitulate tumor biology. The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay. By utilizing an assay developed to classify CRC by its tumor biology, we anticipate development of an enduring tool that will be of greater use than traditional fit-for-purpose tests.   NARRATIVE The molecular characteristics of colon cancer can be described by RNA-based expression, and a consensus classification method has been developed.

"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,9503788,R01NS042645,"['Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population trends', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'molecular subtypes', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,528526,0.14713048497740003
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers. Our goal is to show that the proposed multi-tissue platform can replicate the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients, and be used to develop better therapeutic regimens.",Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies,9549091,UG3EB025765,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Blood Substitutes', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bone Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Myopathy', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Protective Agents', 'Proteins', 'Regimen', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Source', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'bone', 'circulating microRNA', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug testing', 'imaging modality', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic target']",NIBIB,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,UG3,2018,1000,0.00557623674010364
"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9547124,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,552250,0.049688892936678206
"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC.

"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9564081,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2018,929069,0.06178315263483183
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9525301,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,593292,0.03316682023918468
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9440279,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'experimental arm', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'secondary endpoint', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,449175,0.08714916535758481
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9523248,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,634276,0.10689740792152955
"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer",9482506,U01CA225431,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cetuximab', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunotherapy', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'drug discovery', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genomic signature', 'image archival system', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'mutant', 'mutational status', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2018,644727,0.03664708338003332
"Quantifiable Thermal Therapy Using Magnetic Resonance Thermometry Imaging Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, and is characterized with dismal odds due to advanced disease at late stage diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate ranges from 7% for patients with non-resectable disease (~80% of patients), to ~23% for patients with resectable tumors (< 20%of patients). PDAC, like most solid tumors, is highly hypoxic, resulting from both poor oxygen delivery due to leaky and chaotic vasculature and increased oxygen consumption due to high metabolic activity. This makes drug delivery to the tumor microenvironment more difficult and often ineffective. In the past 40 years, only marginal improvements in complete response (CR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QoL) have occurred despite the development of a number of promising chemotherapy, or chemoradiation regimens. New and improved therapeutic options are urgently needed to improve the treatment of this disease. Mild hyperthermia (HT) in the range of 39-42°C has shown to improve blood flow to tumors, enhancing the delivery of therapeutics to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Numerous randomized clinical trials have shown to provide CR, PFS, OR and QoL benefits but implementation in clinical practice has been lagging due to the inability to provide safe, quantifiable and controlled therapeutic thermal dose through accurate temperature monitoring. NTO has designed and built the VectronTTx device which can effectively deliver heat non-invasively in deep tissue without causing skin burns or excessive fat heating (the most common adverse effect encountered with current technologies) without the need for a cooling mechanism such as a water bolus that is a frequent cause for interrupted treatments due to patient discomfort. The heating elements of the device are integrated into an applicator with magnetic resonance (MR) transmit and receive channels to allow for real-time MR thermometry imaging (MRTI) measurements. In this Phase I proposal, we will develop novel MRTI methodologies that significantly improve the state-of-the-art by accurately measuring temperature over HT treatment time scales (30-60 minutes) in an abdominal environment compensating for interfering processes including field drift and motion-induced field variations. We will also develop a treatment- modeling architecture that combines virtual models, patient-specific features, and an artificial intelligence (AI)- based architecture to create extrapolated patient-specific treatment plans. Upon successful completion of Phase I and validation of the developed real-time MRTI monitoring techniques, we will develop methods in Phase II for accurate measurements of temperature in fat by incorporating interleaved or hybrid fat-based techniques into the field-corrected MRTI sequences. In phase II, we will also develop and implement the infrastructure to perform personalized treatment planning. This treatment planning will be based on conventional image transformations, conventional EM-solving, and AI learning of thermal sink and tissue properties. Numerous clinical trials have shown that mild hyperthermia in conjunction with chemotherapy or radiation therapy is a promising strategy to treat cancer. However, adoption in the clinic will require the ability to measure temperature in the heated regions both for safety and to verify tumor heating. NeoTherma Oncology (NTO) has developed a device that can heat tumors non-invasively within a Magnetic Resonance scanner (MR), which will allow the MR to be used to map temperatures inside the body. In this proposal, NTO and the University of Utah will develop MR methods that will provide accurate and precise measurement of temperature in near real-time, allowing evaluation of this device for clinical use.",Quantifiable Thermal Therapy Using Magnetic Resonance Thermometry Imaging,9623256,R43CA233401,"['Abdomen', 'Ablation', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Burn injury', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heating', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperthermia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'In complete remission', 'Industrialization', 'International', 'Interruption', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resectable', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Thermometry', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'crowdsourcing', 'data archive', 'design', 'dosage', 'experience', 'hyperthermia treatment', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'real time monitoring', 'respiratory', 'standard of care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor microenvironment', 'virtual']",NCI,"NEOTHERMA ONCOLOGY, INC.",R43,2018,299014,-0.009832958560135286
"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined.

While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9571234,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,550445,0.03403130637469041
"Cloud quantitative imaging for whole-body tumor burden in neurofibromatoses Project Summary / Abstract The neurofibromatoses (NFs), including NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis, are a group of autosomal-dominant neurogenetic disorders characterized by a predisposition in virtually 100% of patients to develop multiple nerve sheath tumors. The determination of tumor burden on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indispensable for the longitudinal management of NF patients, which includes life-long follow-up for the monitoring of tumor progression and the assessment of treatment response. However, volumetric quantification of NF tumors is not a clinical routine because of the technical challenges in the accurate and reproducible segmentation of highly-irregular and infiltrating NF tumors, in particular plexiform neurofibromas on MRI. The goal of this STTR project is to develop cloud quantitative imaging (CQI) for NF software, denoted as CQI-NF, which will provide the technical and clinical service for volumetric quantification of NF tumors on whole-body and regional MRI via ""virtualization"" (cloud computing) technology. The product developed in this STTR will provide access to this technology for the NF clinical community nationwide and worldwide without the excessive cost to maintain on-site advanced volumetric imaging analysis software and hardware. This project will be built upon existing technologies for volumetric imaging analysis developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using 200 longitudinal whole-body and regional MRI cases collected from the NF community worldwide. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of CQI-NF system: We will continue to develop the CQI-NF system prototyped in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy and efficiency of segmentation by paralleling dynamic-threshold level set (DT level set) in multi-server platform, combining deep-learning in DT level set for the segmentation of NF tumors, and to translate the CQI-NF system from 3DQI/NF into a private cloud platform (such as TeraRecon's iNtuition CLOUD) for the provision of volumetric quantification of NF using a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model in the NF community. (2) Evaluation of CQI-NF system: We will conduct a retrospective clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of the CQI-NF system in the longitudinal monitoring of 200 NF patients collected at MGH Cancer Center and our clinical collaborators worldwide in the NF community. (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for CQI-NF to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of CQI-NF. The successful development and validation of the proposed CQI-NF system will have a high clinical impact in the NF community by providing a cloud-computing infrastructure for the volumetric imaging analysis of NF on MRI, which is not available in current clinical routine, thereby leading to a substantial advance in the longitudinal management of NF patients. Project Narrative The determination of whole-body tumor burden is indispensable for the management of neurofibromatosis (NF) patients, which includes life-long follow-up for the monitoring of tumor progression and assessment of treatment response.

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9487202,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'early screening', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2018,347700,0.002368739167088013
"A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials Project Summary/Abstract There has been a shift to greater use of neadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the clinical management of cancer. Often used in breast cancer to provide systemic treatment for possible or apparent metastatic disease, NACT also reduces the primary tumor size and facilitates breast conservation. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is an effective diagnostic for monitoring tumor regression. There are many methodologies being developed for monitoring cancer in vivo, including contrast agent washout, volumetry, and more recently correlating apparent diffusion coefficients and proton relaxation times to tumor staging. Such imaging biomarkers are predictive of the pathological complete response (pCR) outcome prior to surgery. This enables physicians to provide “evidence based” treatment modifications to reduce deleterious side effects and improve patient outcomes. To obtain quantitative data from MR images, the variations that occur in imaging as a result of hardware and software differences between MRI manufacturers and day-to-day operations must be quantified. In MRI, the data depends on the protocols used to acquire the image, resulting in inconsistencies if even one parameter in the protocol changes. The goal of the proposed work is to produce and develop and disseminate a ground truth physical standard and quality control program for comparison of MRI scanners in the multisite I-SPY2 (ACRIN 6698) trials monitoring pre-operative chemotherapy treatments in the reduction of tumor size. The physical standard is an anthropomorphic breast phantom capable of fitting into all commercial breast coils. It contains novel human tissue mimics and geometric standards with values traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Analysis software capable of protocol compliance checks, rapid identification of the regions of interest, and comparison to ground truth values as measured by NIST will be developed to complement the physical standard. This will enable qualification of sites and quantification of error resulting from scanner performance alone. Given the wide breadth of parameter space that MRI protocols encompass, part of the proposed effort will include the development of protocols specific to image acquisition of tumor volumes and for measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient within the tumor volumes as compared to surrounding healthy tissue. Project Narrative: Quantitative imaging complements precision medicine initiatives by providing a noninvasive method of monitoring gene specific in vivo treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to neurological disorders. To realize quantitative imaging, variations in imaging hardware, software, and procedures must be mitigated. This project will develop a quality assurance and quality control procedure for multisite clinical trials involved in monitoring therapeutic efficacy using MR breast imaging.",A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials,9678297,R44CA235820,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Breast conservation', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Volume', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cloud based', 'computer aided detection', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'human tissue', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'nervous system disorder', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'operation', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,"CALIBERMRI, INC.",R44,2018,224422,0.0034412638452884286
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9256441,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,548074,0.03287076252495036
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery.

"Interpreting limits to nanoparticle delivery in high-stroma low-perfusion tumors 4.4.7 Project Summary/Abstract  The central theme in this work is that critical spatial patterns exist in highly resistant cancer stroma and vascular density that inherently inhibit larger nanoparticle penetration into cancer, and that these phenotypes can be imaged in vivo. We will use in vivo diagnostic imaging, combined with ex vivo analysis to test this in pancreatic cancer, which has as well known drug penetration limitation. Specifically, we will quantify nanoparticle penetration in pancreas cancer, which has high stroma content and low vascular density. The analysis and prediction of efficacy will be quantitatively developed by methodological correlation of in-vivo and ex vivo images using Fourier spatial frequency analysis.  We will determine the characteristic spatial patterns of these tumor microstructures that present as barriers to nanoparticle transport, as assayed through in vivo/ex vivo studies. We have seen that these characteristic spectral features appear in high-field magnetic resonance imaging (HF-MRI) scans and micro-Computed Tomography (uCT) scans of tumors imaged within the ongoing nanoparticle project at DHMC. The scope of this project is to conduct a secondary analysis on the images that are being produced within these projects, with two specific aims. 1) We will directly correlate nanoparticle penetration and distribution to the Fourier spatial frequencies found in in vivo images by Fourier spatial frequency analysis in which we have demonstrated expertise. The in vivo images will be analyzed by correlating them with histological sections of nanoparticle distribution post-treatment. Tumors will be classified on two levels as either a high or low permeability to a specific nanoparticle formulation (to quantify the amount of agent delivered), and as having high or low isotropy (to quantify the dispersion of the agent). 2) We will then apply this characteristic morphology analysis to pre-treatment, pre-operative HF-MRI, uCT images, and analyze their value as a potential diagnostic classifier. We will use a Support Vector Machine Analysis to predict the permeability and isotropy of unknown tumors, and validate our results against experimental outcomes. An iterative strategy will optimize the predictive power of the method, and be used to distinguish between characteristic spectra that are good and bad classifiers.  The research will be produced using the unique software systems that we have designed during preliminary studies, and will be deployed on an analysis platform that can be integrated with the hospital- based DICOM and virtual pathology environment to allow clinical investigators to plan adjuvant therapies to promote nanoparticle efficacy. Several hundred high-quality scans are now available for analysis, which will be processed and reported on within the first year of funding. By year two, the established system is projected to be able to analyze images within a few minutes post-scan. These analysis methods will give us the key background needed to advance our fundamental understanding of nanoparticle in-vivo delivery, and test ways to interrupt transport barriers in interventional future work. 4.4.8 Project Narrative The PI will apply a novel image analysis method to identify spatial patterns in images taken from in vivo experiments that indicate the presence of physical barriers to nanoparticle and liposomal transport in solid cancer tumor. Successful completion of this proposal will result in methods to predict the permeability of tumors to nanoparticle and large-molecule adjuvant therapies during the planning stage.",Interpreting limits to nanoparticle delivery in high-stroma low-perfusion tumors,9307795,R03CA208510,"['Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Center', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Intercellular Fluid', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Isotropy', 'Liposomes', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Nanotechnology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'density', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'experimental study', 'fluid flow', 'histological image', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'magnetic field', 'nanoparticle', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'oncology', 'prevent', 'secondary analysis', 'software systems', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R03,2017,2500,0.019763790678996765
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"MRI brain morphometry for computer-aided detection of neurological disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The technology that is routinely available to neuroradiologists is years or decades behind that which is used in imaging research throughout the world. Current clinical decision-making in neuroradiology is based on information that is insufficient for detecting the subtle changes that presage clinically significant conditions such a a growing tumor, enlarging ventricle, or shrinking hippocampus.  Tools that are regularly used in research are not accessible in the clinic due to a number of factors: slow execution speed, sensitivity to scanner manufacturer, field strength and pulse sequence, and lack of FDA clearance. In this project we seek to remove these barriers by further developing FreeSurfer, the world's premier automated brain morphometry package, to (1) integrate novel deep-learning and Random Forest- based patch-matching image synthesis technology into FreeSurfer to make it robust to variations in scanner platform and acquisition parameters, (2) use modern parallel-processing to reduce execution time to a clinically-feasible length, and (3) obtain FDA clearance on the tools allowing them to be routinely used in direct patient care.  The resulting product would dramatically improve the information that neuroradiologists have access to for patient diagnosis, staging, and the assessment of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for disorders including AD, tumor, hydrocephalus, and epilepsy, to name a few. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology that is currently routinely available to neuroradiologists is years or decades behind that which is used in imaging research throughout the world. In this proposal we seek to bridge the gap between research and the clinic, by developing a clinical utility based on FreeSurfer, the world's leading software package for automated brain morphometry.

"Exploring the Role of Mitochondrial Fission in Pancreatic Tumorigenesis Project Summary A wealth of data over the past few years, from our lab and others, has demonstrated that the mitochondrial morphology of tumor cells is distinct from normal cells. Furthermore, a number of studies have shown that genetic or pharmacological manipulation of the machinery that regulates mitochondrial morphology can impact a variety of tumorigenic processes. Indeed, in work performed for the parent grant of this proposal, we have shown that genetic inhibition of the mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1 can block pancreatic tumor growth and increase survival in a genetically engineered mouse model. This work has led to the deeper question of how changes in mitochondrial shape, which ultimately result from a combination of both genetic and environmental influences, contribute to the physiological processes that drive tumor growth. This question has been difficult to ask using traditional genetic and pharmacological approaches due to the complexity of the signaling pathways that converge on the mitochondria and the inherent heterogeneity present within the tumor and its surrounding stroma. To that end, we have developed a new software package designed to catalogue the morphological features of mitochondria within cells in culture or in fixed tissue. By using this software to analyze the tumor cells developed in our mouse models of pancreatic cancer, we propose to determine the relationship between specific mitochondrial features and key physiological attributes of these tumors. To do this, we have developed a machine learning technique, validated against a panel of tumor derived pancreatic cell lines with genetically-induced mitochondrial heterogeneity, capable of identifying relationships between mitochondrial features, or combinations of mitochondrial features, and other attributes of those cells. This approach will allow us to leverage the wealth of phenotypic data we have collected from our tumors with the data we are now able to collect on the mitochondrial heterogeneity, either between or within those tumors, in order to identify the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in tumor growth, regardless of whether that heterogeneity arises from manipulation of the mitochondrial dynamics machinery or whether it arises from the myriad influences within the tumor environment. Successful completion of these aims will provide critical insights into the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in pancreatic tumor growth and also pave the way for future analysis of mitochondrial heterogeneity in other tumor types. Project Narrative Our work exploring the role of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission in pancreatic tumor growth, using two relevant mouse models, has revealed that genetic inhibition of Drp1 can inhibit tumor growth and extend survival. In addition, these models provide a wealth of data to more deeply explore the relationship between mitochondrial heterogeneity and tumor physiology. We have developed robust computational methodology with which to explore this relationship. This exciting novel approach will provide critical insight into pancreatic tumorigenesis and potentially uncover novel therapeutic approaches.",Exploring the Role of Mitochondrial Fission in Pancreatic Tumorigenesis,9384887,R01CA200755,"['Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Models', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease Progression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Normal Cell', 'Oncogenic', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pancreatic cell line', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'pancreatic tumorigenesis', 'parent grant', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenic', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,191853,0.09117146467539089
"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,9293390,R01NS042645,"['Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population trends', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'molecular subtypes', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,533501,0.14713048497740003
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics.

"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers.

"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The integration of a machine-learning algorithm will further provide precise and unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor ecosystem.",Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems,9392396,U01CA214411,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomimetics', 'Biopsy', 'Bioreactors', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cetuximab', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glucose', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidics', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Rest', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Derived', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'cytokine', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fluid flow', 'genetic profiling', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'protein B', 'response', 'survival outcome', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2017,653695,0.059984446402702694
"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9389124,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injectable', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2017,716510,0.06178315263483183
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9264495,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,449175,0.08714916535758481
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9324146,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,487132,0.03316682023918468
"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context,9324902,R00CA172360,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metalloproteases', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Publications', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Serbia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Cell Migration', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'intravital imaging', 'live cell microscopy', 'macrophage', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiphoton imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'time use', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R00,2017,248886,0.08046914080354522
"Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This work seeks to understand whether long non-coding RNAs implicate in the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a form of malignant brain tumors. By characterizing these novel gene regulatory molecules in GBM, we expect to identify novel biomarkers that can be used as a prognostic tool for patients with GBM. This approach could also be applied to other human cancers.",Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas,9321295,R21CA209345,"['19q', 'Achievement', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nucleotides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Inactivation', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'flexibility', 'gene function', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'molecular subtypes', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'oligo (dT)', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,165732,0.008004909186440243
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9314557,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,644766,0.10689740792152955
"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9388399,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,446226,0.03403130637469041
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9292041,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2017,347700,0.002368739167088013
"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,9315122,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Glioblastoma', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'genomic biomarker', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2017,119048,0.06822362330234345
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9067256,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,549985,0.03287076252495036
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery.

"Interpreting limits to nanoparticle delivery in high-stroma low-perfusion tumors 4.4.7 Project Summary/Abstract  The central theme in this work is that critical spatial patterns exist in highly resistant cancer stroma and vascular density that inherently inhibit larger nanoparticle penetration into cancer, and that these phenotypes can be imaged in vivo. We will use in vivo diagnostic imaging, combined with ex vivo analysis to test this in pancreatic cancer, which has as well known drug penetration limitation. Specifically, we will quantify nanoparticle penetration in pancreas cancer, which has high stroma content and low vascular density. The analysis and prediction of efficacy will be quantitatively developed by methodological correlation of in-vivo and ex vivo images using Fourier spatial frequency analysis.  We will determine the characteristic spatial patterns of these tumor microstructures that present as barriers to nanoparticle transport, as assayed through in vivo/ex vivo studies. We have seen that these characteristic spectral features appear in high-field magnetic resonance imaging (HF-MRI) scans and micro-Computed Tomography (uCT) scans of tumors imaged within the ongoing nanoparticle project at DHMC. The scope of this project is to conduct a secondary analysis on the images that are being produced within these projects, with two specific aims. 1) We will directly correlate nanoparticle penetration and distribution to the Fourier spatial frequencies found in in vivo images by Fourier spatial frequency analysis in which we have demonstrated expertise. The in vivo images will be analyzed by correlating them with histological sections of nanoparticle distribution post-treatment. Tumors will be classified on two levels as either a high or low permeability to a specific nanoparticle formulation (to quantify the amount of agent delivered), and as having high or low isotropy (to quantify the dispersion of the agent). 2) We will then apply this characteristic morphology analysis to pre-treatment, pre-operative HF-MRI, uCT images, and analyze their value as a potential diagnostic classifier. We will use a Support Vector Machine Analysis to predict the permeability and isotropy of unknown tumors, and validate our results against experimental outcomes. An iterative strategy will optimize the predictive power of the method, and be used to distinguish between characteristic spectra that are good and bad classifiers.  The research will be produced using the unique software systems that we have designed during preliminary studies, and will be deployed on an analysis platform that can be integrated with the hospital- based DICOM and virtual pathology environment to allow clinical investigators to plan adjuvant therapies to promote nanoparticle efficacy. Several hundred high-quality scans are now available for analysis, which will be processed and reported on within the first year of funding. By year two, the established system is projected to be able to analyze images within a few minutes post-scan. These analysis methods will give us the key background needed to advance our fundamental understanding of nanoparticle in-vivo delivery, and test ways to interrupt transport barriers in interventional future work. 4.4.8 Project Narrative The PI will apply a novel image analysis method to identify spatial patterns in images taken from in vivo experiments that indicate the presence of physical barriers to nanoparticle and liposomal transport in solid cancer tumor. Successful completion of this proposal will result in methods to predict the permeability of tumors to nanoparticle and large-molecule adjuvant therapies during the planning stage.",Interpreting limits to nanoparticle delivery in high-stroma low-perfusion tumors,9172223,R03CA208510,"['Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Center', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Intercellular Fluid', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Isotropy', 'Lead', 'Liposomes', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Nanotechnology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'density', 'design', 'fluid flow', 'histological image', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'oncology', 'prevent', 'research study', 'software systems', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R03,2016,81000,0.019763790678996765
"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9194067,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'genomic tools', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'precision medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,562825,0.049688892936678206
"MRI brain morphometry for computer-aided detection of neurological disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The technology that is routinely available to neuroradiologists is years or decades behind that which is used in imaging research throughout the world. Current clinical decision-making in neuroradiology is based on information that is insufficient for detecting the subtle changes that presage clinically significant conditions such a a growing tumor, enlarging ventricle, or shrinking hippocampus.  Tools that are regularly used in research are not accessible in the clinic due to a number of factors: slow execution speed, sensitivity to scanner manufacturer, field strength and pulse sequence, and lack of FDA clearance. In this project we seek to remove these barriers by further developing FreeSurfer, the world's premier automated brain morphometry package, to (1) integrate novel deep-learning and Random Forest- based patch-matching image synthesis technology into FreeSurfer to make it robust to variations in scanner platform and acquisition parameters, (2) use modern parallel-processing to reduce execution time to a clinically-feasible length, and (3) obtain FDA clearance on the tools allowing them to be routinely used in direct patient care.  The resulting product would dramatically improve the information that neuroradiologists have access to for patient diagnosis, staging, and the assessment of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for disorders including AD, tumor, hydrocephalus, and epilepsy, to name a few. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology that is currently routinely available to neuroradiologists is years or decades behind that which is used in imaging research throughout the world.

"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,9095431,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'molecular subtypes', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'radiosensitizing', 'social', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'trend', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,538156,0.14713048497740003
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9132190,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Survival', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,626891,0.03316682023918468
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.        ",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9106459,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,498724,0.08714916535758481
"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context,9144743,R00CA172360,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metalloproteases', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Publications', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Serbia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Cell Migration', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'career development', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'intravital imaging', 'live cell microscopy', 'macrophage', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'research study', 'statistics', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'time use', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R00,2016,249000,0.08046914080354522
"Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This work seeks to understand whether long non-coding RNAs implicate in the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a form of malignant brain tumors. By characterizing these novel gene regulatory molecules in GBM, we expect to identify novel biomarkers that can be used as a prognostic tool for patients with GBM. This approach could also be applied to other human cancers.",Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas,9178948,R21CA209345,"['19q', 'Achievement', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nucleotides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Tissue Banking', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Inactivation', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'flexibility', 'gene function', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'molecular subtypes', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'oligo (dT)', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2016,199629,0.008004909186440243
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9186255,R01CA206180,"['Accounting', 'Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cone', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,669786,0.10689740792152955
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals. The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.",Objective decision support environment for clinical trials,9143689,U01CA160045,"['Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Differentiation Therapy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Property', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical decision-making', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2016,522865,0.04040009562928852
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9067260,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2016,347700,0.002368739167088013
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.

"Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, nd treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing sub-visual attributes about tumors just from morphology. Some of these sub-visual features may encode for disease aggressiveness in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer. Additionally these sub-visual or ""histologic biomarkers"" can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and can be extracted via computerized image analysis. Recent analyses have shown that one of the major reasons for the ""over-diagnosis"" of breast cancer is the increased diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The current rate of DCIS diagnosis is 56 per 100,000 women (NEJM 2012). The standard of care for DCIS management is surgery followed by local radiation with the addition of endocrine therapy for lesions expressing estrogen receptor. This regimen brings the recurrence rates down from 25% (in untreated patients) to around 10%. Identification of which patients may benefit from treatment has been difficult because of the low incidence of adverse events necessitating long term followup. Molecular studies recently been performed by the Badve group (in collaboration with Genomic Health, Inc) on the E-5194 clinical trial, led to the development and commercialization of a molecular assay, the DCIS Score, which predicts the likelihood of development of ipsilateral DCIS and/or invasive cancer. However, the DCIS Score does not comprehensively account for disease heterogeneity since the assay was developed in a cohort considered low risk by clinicopathological characteristics; the performance of the assay in the ""real-world"" situation is not known. The focus of this project is t optimize and evaluate a multistain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which DCISs are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). msCHIP employs digitized H&E and immunohistochemistry stained (Ki67, CD10 measuring cellular proliferation, vascularity) tissue sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei, and proliferative index will be extracted via advanced computer vision tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive DCISs will be identified. The successful validation of msCHIP on a large cohort of 300 cases could pave the way for rapid adoption of msCHIP as an oncological decision support tool, providing critical information for more informed treatment decisions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a multi-stain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). The successful validation of msCHIP could pave the way for its adoption as a decision support tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be ""de-escalated"" or specifically targeted in order to maintain favorable survival rates while minimizing the substantial (and long term) treatment-related morbidity and expense from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.",Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS,9037632,R21CA195152,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellularity', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'Texture', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disease heterogeneity', 'follow-up', 'genetic approach', 'histological image', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'indexing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,201504,0.0031487232641621804
"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,9128413,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'genomic biomarker', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2016,117968,0.06822362330234345
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8849399,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,554150,0.03287076252495036
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits.

"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.

"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,8915752,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'radiosensitizing', 'social', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'trend', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,541169,0.14713048497740003
"MRI brain morphometry for computer-aided detection of neurological disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The technology that is routinely available to neuroradiologists is years or decades behind that which is used in imaging research throughout the world. Current clinical decision-making in neuroradiology is based on information that is insufficient for detecting the subtle changes that presage clinically significant conditions such a a growing tumor, enlarging ventricle, or shrinking hippocampus.  Tools that are regularly used in research are not accessible in the clinic due to a number of factors: slow execution speed, sensitivity to scanner manufacturer, field strength and pulse sequence, and lack of FDA clearance. In this project we seek to remove these barriers by further developing FreeSurfer, the world's premier automated brain morphometry package, to (1) integrate novel deep-learning and Random Forest- based patch-matching image synthesis technology into FreeSurfer to make it robust to variations in scanner platform and acquisition parameters, (2) use modern parallel-processing to reduce execution time to a clinically-feasible length, and (3) obtain FDA clearance on the tools allowing them to be routinely used in direct patient care.  The resulting product would dramatically improve the information that neuroradiologists have access to for patient diagnosis, staging, and the assessment of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for disorders including AD, tumor, hydrocephalus, and epilepsy, to name a few.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology that is currently routinely available to neuroradiologists is years or decades behind that which is used in imaging research throughout the world.

"Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic profiling has become a routine practice in selecting treatments for many diseases, enabling the classification of patients into categories that associate with improved outcomes for specific treatments. One potential detractor to this approach is the tremendous heterogeneity in tissues used for profiling. Genomic classifications, obtained from a relatively small biopsy, are subject to influence from broad, regional variations in the affected tissue. Heterogeneity on a cellular scale can also obscure the target of treatment, as cells with distinct molecular profiles are homogenized in genomic profiling. Realizing better therapies will depend greatly on the ability to understand molecular heterogeneity within an individual, a challenge that necessitates new approaches to organize, analyze and integrate data from multiple spatial and molecular scales. This proposal describes an informatics framework to characterizing heterogeneity for tissue based studies. The framework will combine imaging informatics with genomics to describe molecular heterogeneity at multiple spatial and molecular scales. The imaging component will leverage a novel quantum dot technology that enables detailed mapping of multiple protein expression pathways within a single sample. Fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging will be used to measure DNA content. Whole-slide digitization will enable computer algorithms to capture molecular profiles of hundreds of millions of cells, calculating quantitative features to describe their expression patterns and DNA content. Biologically meaningful descriptions of each cell will be generated using a novel active machine learning classifier to annotate cells with an ontology describing molecular biology and cell anatomy, enabling slides to be analyzed in a biological context. Cell boundaries, features, and annotations will be integrated through the Pathology Analytic Imaging Standards (PAIS) database to provide support for data mining analysis. Mining methods will be developed to find the enrichment of cellular phenotypes, and to analyze the spatial layout of cells with respect to structures like blood vessels to discover the influence of the tissue microenvironment on key expression pathways in surrounding cells. These tools will be applied to studies of glioblastoma brain tumors, but are relevant for studies of other solid tissue diseases. The scientific study wil use tissues resected in a novel clinical trial that accurately defines the invading tumor margin, bulk and necrosis-rich core. Tissues will be analyzed for gene expression and imaging to generate a paired genomic-imaging profile for each region. Mining the imaging and gene expression profiles of these regions will identify intra-tumoral differences in cellular phenotypes and illustrate the extent of variation in genomic classifications. The paired imaging and gene expression profiles will also be mined to determine relationships between specific expression classes and the imaging observations to illustrate a complete picture of heterogeneity. A project repository will be deployed to disseminate images, analysis pipelines and analytic results.

"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.                ","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",8960049,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Survival', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,652612,0.03316682023918468
"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context,9070066,R00CA172360,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metalloproteases', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Publications', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Serbia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'career development', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'design', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'intravital imaging', 'macrophage', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'research study', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R00,2015,249000,0.08046914080354522
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals. The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.",Objective decision support environment for clinical trials,8926887,U01CA160045,"['Algorithms', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Differentiation Therapy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Property', 'Qualifying', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical decision-making', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'male', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2015,522865,0.04040009562928852
"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics. n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8895855,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast Cancer therapy', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,658727,0.04512695482265913
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research.

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,8876876,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2015,347700,0.002368739167088013
"Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By 2020 the number of patients with p16+ (HPV-related) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is predicted to surpass that for cervical SCC. Epidemiologists have termed this a head and neck cancer ""epidemic."" At the same time, there is an emerging view that we may be ""over-treating"" patients with p16+ (HPV-related) OSCC because it is typically more biologically indolent, with tumors having less gross chromosomal abnormalities, ~1/2 the gene mutation rate, and favorable responses to treatment. For these reasons, many speculate that therapies could be ""de-escalated"" to maintain favorable patient survival while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. However, a significant minority of patients with p16+ OSCC have aggressive disease that will recur, predominantly in the form of distant metastasis, resulting in death. There are currently few clinical-and no molecular-markers to discriminate more from less aggressive p16+ OSCC.  The focus of this project is to optimize and evaluate a quantitative histomorphometric (QH)-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to identify which p16+ OSCC are likely to be clinically aggressive and which OSCC patients have cancers that are very unlikely to recur. QuHbIC only requires digitized images of standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei will be extracted via advanced computer vision and pattern recognition tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive p16+ OSCC will be identified. Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, H&E morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, and treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing information about tumors just from their morphology. The hypotheses underlying this project are that (a) markers for disease aggressiveness are encoded in visual attributes in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer, and some of these ""histologic biomarkers"" (e.g. nuclear anaplasia and/or multi-nucleation) can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and (b) these ""histologic biomarkers"" can be extracted via computerized image analysis.  QuHbIC will be trained and refined via a large cohort of digitized H&E slides with long term clinical follow up data from Washington University in St. Louis (Wash U). Independent evaluation of the classifier will be performed on scanned H&E slides available from both Wash U and Johns Hopkins University. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for rapid integration of QuHbIC into the clinical workflow as a decision support tool, providing critical information to assist oncologists in making more informed treatment decisions.

The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as a decision support tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be ""de-escalated"" or specifically targeted in order to maintain favorable survival rates while minimizing the substantial (and long term) treatment-related morbidity and expense from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.",Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma,8923176,R21CA179327,"['Adoption', 'Anaplasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nuclear', 'Oncologist', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'follow-up', 'genetic approach', 'imaging Segmentation', 'lymph nodes', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,203048,0.06586820605722983
"Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, nd treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing sub-visual attributes about tumors just from morphology. Some of these sub-visual features may encode for disease aggressiveness in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer. Additionally these sub-visual or ""histologic biomarkers"" can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and can be extracted via computerized image analysis. Recent analyses have shown that one of the major reasons for the ""over-diagnosis"" of breast cancer is the increased diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The current rate of DCIS diagnosis is 56 per 100,000 women (NEJM 2012). The standard of care for DCIS management is surgery followed by local radiation with the addition of endocrine therapy for lesions expressing estrogen receptor. This regimen brings the recurrence rates down from 25% (in untreated patients) to around 10%. Identification of which patients may benefit from treatment has been difficult because of the low incidence of adverse events necessitating long term followup. Molecular studies recently been performed by the Badve group (in collaboration with Genomic Health, Inc) on the E-5194 clinical trial, led to the development and commercialization of a molecular assay, the DCIS Score, which predicts the likelihood of development of ipsilateral DCIS and/or invasive cancer. However, the DCIS Score does not comprehensively account for disease heterogeneity since the assay was developed in a cohort considered low risk by clinicopathological characteristics; the performance of the assay in the ""real-world"" situation is not known. The focus of this project is t optimize and evaluate a multistain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which DCISs are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). msCHIP employs digitized H&E and immunohistochemistry stained (Ki67, CD10 measuring cellular proliferation, vascularity) tissue sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei, and proliferative index will be extracted via advanced computer vision tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive DCISs will be identified. The successful validation of msCHIP on a large cohort of 300 cases could pave the way for rapid adoption of msCHIP as an oncological decision support tool, providing critical information for more informed treatment decisions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a multi-stain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE).

"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,8887315,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2015,117968,0.06822362330234345
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.            ",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8697721,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,501194,0.03287076252495036
"MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an image-based diagnostic system for Glioblastoma (GBM) that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. This should facilitate the delivery of individualized care for patients with GBM. Current therapy selection is formulaic and uniform for all patients and does not account for broad genetic diversity that contributes to treatment resistance and dismal prognosis. Specifically, each patient's GBM is uniquely heterogeneous and comprised of multiple distinct subclonal populations with differing susceptibilities to therapy This diversity causes tumors to respond non-uniformly to targeted therapy and allows resistant clones to repopulate as recurrent disease. Additionally, conventional MRI routinely guides surgical resection of enhancing tumor core, but leaves behind tumor populations within adjacent non-enhancing parenchyma, or brain around tumor (BAT). The BAT represents the primary target of adjuvant therapy because it harbors the residual tumor populations that nearly universally recur. Curating the genomic diversity within BAT should inform treatment selection, but this region is almost never biopsied because it is poorly evaluated on conventional MRI. Currently, there is no systematic method that addresses intratumoral heterogeneity to characterize the regional genomic diversity within BAT. To address this critical need, this exploratory proposal will develop and test a novel mapping system that integrates multi-parametric MRI with image-guided tissue analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms to delineate regional genomic variations in GBM. This system uses conventional MRI to identify major tumoral subcomponents: enhancing core, BAT, and central necrosis. Within these subcomponents, advanced MRI (perfusion, diffusion, texture) will further characterize regional tumor properties (i.e., angiogenesis, permeability, invasion, and proliferation) that represent phenotypic expression of underlying genomic status. These MRI traits will guide stereotactic biopsies from distinct tumoral subregions to generate matched pairs of MRI and genomic data. An ML algorithm will incorporate these data to estimate regional genomic diversity throughout each tumor, including BAT areas that have not been surgically sampled. We have unified a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from institutions that have substantial and long-standing collaborations. Our group offers expertise in multiple fields of study that are necessary to accomplish the research aims, including: 1) image processing and analytics; 2) image-guided stereotactic surgery and coregistration; 3) development of machine learning (ML) methodology; and 4) comprehensive genomic interrogation and cell biology of tumor within BAT. If successful, the work proposed here should significantly impact how GBM patients are diagnosed and treated. This potentially improves clinical outcomes by enabling a paradigm shift from ""one treatment fits all"" to a mutations-based approach that selects combinatorial therapies targeting individual tumor populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing an image-based mapping system that characterizes regionally diverse populations within individual tumors, the proposed exploratory work will facilitate the development of improved targeted combinatorial therapies as the basis for future work in an R01 application.             ",MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma,8620732,R21NS082609,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Necrosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'War', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'field study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R21,2014,219825,0.05790338221041272
"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.

"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.             ",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,8695890,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'statistics', 'trend', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,560015,0.14713048497740003
"Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic profiling has become a routine practice in selecting treatments for many diseases, enabling the classification of patients into categories that associate with improved outcomes for specific treatments. One potential detractor to this approach is the tremendous heterogeneity in tissues used for profiling. Genomic classifications, obtained from a relatively small biopsy, are subject to influence from broad, regional variations in the affected tissue. Heterogeneity on a cellular scale can also obscure the target of treatment, as cells with distinct molecular profiles are homogenized in genomic profiling. Realizing better therapies will depend greatly on the ability to understand molecular heterogeneity within an individual, a challenge that necessitates new approaches to organize, analyze and integrate data from multiple spatial and molecular scales. This proposal describes an informatics framework to characterizing heterogeneity for tissue based studies. The framework will combine imaging informatics with genomics to describe molecular heterogeneity at multiple spatial and molecular scales. The imaging component will leverage a novel quantum dot technology that enables detailed mapping of multiple protein expression pathways within a single sample. Fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging will be used to measure DNA content. Whole-slide digitization will enable computer algorithms to capture molecular profiles of hundreds of millions of cells, calculating quantitative features to describe their expression patterns and DNA content. Biologically meaningful descriptions of each cell will be generated using a novel active machine learning classifier to annotate cells with an ontology describing molecular biology and cell anatomy, enabling slides to be analyzed in a biological context. Cell boundaries, features, and annotations will be integrated through the Pathology Analytic Imaging Standards (PAIS) database to provide support for data mining analysis. Mining methods will be developed to find the enrichment of cellular phenotypes, and to analyze the spatial layout of cells with respect to structures like blood vessels to discover the influence of the tissue microenvironment on key expression pathways in surrounding cells. These tools will be applied to studies of glioblastoma brain tumors, but are relevant for studies of other solid tissue diseases. The scientific study wil use tissues resected in a novel clinical trial that accurately defines the invading tumor margin, bulk and necrosis-rich core. Tissues will be analyzed for gene expression and imaging to generate a paired genomic-imaging profile for each region. Mining the imaging and gene expression profiles of these regions will identify intra-tumoral differences in cellular phenotypes and illustrate the extent of variation in genomic classifications. The paired imaging and gene expression profiles will also be mined to determine relationships between specific expression classes and the imaging observations to illustrate a complete picture of heterogeneity. A project repository will be deployed to disseminate images, analysis pipelines and analytic results. This repository will provide a public resource for brain tumor research and access to open source tools.                 PROJECT NARRATIVE Developing effective treatments for disease requires an understanding of their molecular mechanisms. The software tools created by this research will enable researchers to better identify variations in the mechanisms of disease within an individual, and to develop and apply more effective therapies to improve patient outcomes.",Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis,8710341,K22LM011576,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Invaded', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Necrosis', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Ploidies', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Simulate', 'Slide', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'comparative', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'human tissue', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'molecular scale', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'protein expression', 'repository', 'routine practice', 'small molecule', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'tumor']",NLM,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K22,2014,162303,0.01010210032063268
"Systems microscopy analysis of tumor cell motility in microenvironment context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems microscopy analysis of tumor cell motility in microenvironment context,8716702,K99CA172360,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metalloproteases', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Publications', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Serbia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'career development', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'design', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'intravital imaging', 'macrophage', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'research study', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K99,2014,138712,0.08046914080354522
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials     DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals.           The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.  .

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8712174,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,641994,0.04512695482265913
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research.

"Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By 2020 the number of patients with p16+ (HPV-related) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is predicted to surpass that for cervical SCC. Epidemiologists have termed this a head and neck cancer ""epidemic."" At the same time, there is an emerging view that we may be ""over-treating"" patients with p16+ (HPV-related) OSCC because it is typically more biologically indolent, with tumors having less gross chromosomal abnormalities, ~1/2 the gene mutation rate, and favorable responses to treatment. For these reasons, many speculate that therapies could be ""de-escalated"" to maintain favorable patient survival while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. However, a significant minority of patients with p16+ OSCC have aggressive disease that will recur, predominantly in the form of distant metastasis, resulting in death. There are currently few clinical-and no molecular-markers to discriminate more from less aggressive p16+ OSCC.  The focus of this project is to optimize and evaluate a quantitative histomorphometric (QH)-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to identify which p16+ OSCC are likely to be clinically aggressive and which OSCC patients have cancers that are very unlikely to recur. QuHbIC only requires digitized images of standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei will be extracted via advanced computer vision and pattern recognition tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive p16+ OSCC will be identified. Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, H&E morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, and treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing information about tumors just from their morphology. The hypotheses underlying this project are that (a) markers for disease aggressiveness are encoded in visual attributes in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer, and some of these ""histologic biomarkers"" (e.g. nuclear anaplasia and/or multi-nucleation) can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and (b) these ""histologic biomarkers"" can be extracted via computerized image analysis.  QuHbIC will be trained and refined via a large cohort of digitized H&E slides with long term clinical follow up data from Washington University in St. Louis (Wash U). Independent evaluation of the classifier will be performed on scanned H&E slides available from both Wash U and Johns Hopkins University. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for rapid integration of QuHbIC into the clinical workflow as a decision support tool, providing critical information to assist oncologists in making more informed treatment decisions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a quantitative histomorphometric (QH)- based image classifier (QuHbIC) to identify which p16+ (HPV-related) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients (OSCC) are likely to have aggressive cancers and, perhaps even more importantly, for identifying which patients have cancers that are very unlikely to recur. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as a decision support tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be ""de-escalated"" or specifically targeted in order to maintain favorable survival rates while minimizing the substantial (and long term) treatment-related morbidity and expense from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.            ",Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma,8756202,R21CA179327,"['Adoption', 'Anaplasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nuclear', 'Oncologist', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'follow-up', 'imaging Segmentation', 'lymph nodes', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,185934,0.06586820605722983
"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.            ",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,8618183,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2014,116888,0.06822362330234345
"MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an image-based diagnostic system for Glioblastoma (GBM) that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. This should facilitate the delivery of individualized care for patients with GBM. Current therapy selection is formulaic and uniform for all patients and does not account for broad genetic diversity that contributes to treatment resistance and dismal prognosis. Specifically, each patient's GBM is uniquely heterogeneous and comprised of multiple distinct subclonal populations with differing susceptibilities to therapy This diversity causes tumors to respond non-uniformly to targeted therapy and allows resistant clones to repopulate as recurrent disease. Additionally, conventional MRI routinely guides surgical resection of enhancing tumor core, but leaves behind tumor populations within adjacent non-enhancing parenchyma, or brain around tumor (BAT). The BAT represents the primary target of adjuvant therapy because it harbors the residual tumor populations that nearly universally recur. Curating the genomic diversity within BAT should inform treatment selection, but this region is almost never biopsied because it is poorly evaluated on conventional MRI. Currently, there is no systematic method that addresses intratumoral heterogeneity to characterize the regional genomic diversity within BAT. To address this critical need, this exploratory proposal will develop and test a novel mapping system that integrates multi-parametric MRI with image-guided tissue analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms to delineate regional genomic variations in GBM. This system uses conventional MRI to identify major tumoral subcomponents: enhancing core, BAT, and central necrosis. Within these subcomponents, advanced MRI (perfusion, diffusion, texture) will further characterize regional tumor properties (i.e., angiogenesis, permeability, invasion, and proliferation) that represent phenotypic expression of underlying genomic status. These MRI traits will guide stereotactic biopsies from distinct tumoral subregions to generate matched pairs of MRI and genomic data. An ML algorithm will incorporate these data to estimate regional genomic diversity throughout each tumor, including BAT areas that have not been surgically sampled. We have unified a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from institutions that have substantial and long-standing collaborations. Our group offers expertise in multiple fields of study that are necessary to accomplish the research aims, including: 1) image processing and analytics; 2) image-guided stereotactic surgery and coregistration; 3) development of machine learning (ML) methodology; and 4) comprehensive genomic interrogation and cell biology of tumor within BAT. If successful, the work proposed here should significantly impact how GBM patients are diagnosed and treated. This potentially improves clinical outcomes by enabling a paradigm shift from ""one treatment fits all"" to a mutations-based approach that selects combinatorial therapies targeting individual tumor populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing an image-based mapping system that characterizes regionally diverse populations within individual tumors, the proposed exploratory work will facilitate the development of improved targeted combinatorial therapies as the basis for future work in an R01 application.             ",MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma,8490147,R21NS082609,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Necrosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'War', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'field study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R21,2013,305251,0.05790338221041272
"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy.

"Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic profiling has become a routine practice in selecting treatments for many diseases, enabling the classification of patients into categories that associate with improved outcomes for specific treatments. One potential detractor to this approach is the tremendous heterogeneity in tissues used for profiling. Genomic classifications, obtained from a relatively small biopsy, are subject to influence from broad, regional variations in the affected tissue. Heterogeneity on a cellular scale can also obscure the target of treatment, as cells with distinct molecular profiles are homogenized in genomic profiling. Realizing better therapies will depend greatly on the ability to understand molecular heterogeneity within an individual, a challenge that necessitates new approaches to organize, analyze and integrate data from multiple spatial and molecular scales. This proposal describes an informatics framework to characterizing heterogeneity for tissue based studies. The framework will combine imaging informatics with genomics to describe molecular heterogeneity at multiple spatial and molecular scales. The imaging component will leverage a novel quantum dot technology that enables detailed mapping of multiple protein expression pathways within a single sample. Fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging will be used to measure DNA content. Whole-slide digitization will enable computer algorithms to capture molecular profiles of hundreds of millions of cells, calculating quantitative features to describe their expression patterns and DNA content. Biologically meaningful descriptions of each cell will be generated using a novel active machine learning classifier to annotate cells with an ontology describing molecular biology and cell anatomy, enabling slides to be analyzed in a biological context. Cell boundaries, features, and annotations will be integrated through the Pathology Analytic Imaging Standards (PAIS) database to provide support for data mining analysis. Mining methods will be developed to find the enrichment of cellular phenotypes, and to analyze the spatial layout of cells with respect to structures like blood vessels to discover the influence of the tissue microenvironment on key expression pathways in surrounding cells. These tools will be applied to studies of glioblastoma brain tumors, but are relevant for studies of other solid tissue diseases. The scientific study wil use tissues resected in a novel clinical trial that accurately defines the invading tumor margin, bulk and necrosis-rich core. Tissues will be analyzed for gene expression and imaging to generate a paired genomic-imaging profile for each region. Mining the imaging and gene expression profiles of these regions will identify intra-tumoral differences in cellular phenotypes and illustrate the extent of variation in genomic classifications. The paired imaging and gene expression profiles will also be mined to determine relationships between specific expression classes and the imaging observations to illustrate a complete picture of heterogeneity. A project repository will be deployed to disseminate images, analysis pipelines and analytic results. This repository will provide a public resource for brain tumor research and access to open source tools.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Developing effective treatments for disease requires an understanding of their molecular mechanisms.

"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.        Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This platform can be used for an assessment of LNM which is paramount for appropriate treatment planning.

"Systems microscopy analysis of tumor cell motility in microenvironment context     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.     Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.     Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.        The written critiques and criteria scores of individual reviewers are provided in essentially unedited form in the ""Critique"" section below.

"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials     DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals.           The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.  .

"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8532654,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2013,625194,0.04512695482265913
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.",Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma,8473174,R01CA135509,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Angiogenesis Promoter', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Facies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'VHL mutation', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'angiogenesis', 'bHLH-PAS factor HLF', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer therapy', 'caspase-3', 'cell behavior', 'human FRAP1 protein', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'intercellular communication', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,421339,0.07112222408388871
"Enhancing tumor vascular damage with gold nanoparticles aided radiation therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent developments in anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting therapies as well as hypofractionated radiotherapy have shown the great potential of tumor vasculature as a therapeutic target for cancer medicine. We have an original idea for using targeted gold nanoparticles as vascular disruptive agents (VDA) in conjunction with clinical megavoltage photon beams. Unlike competing proposals, we recognize that gold nanoparticles tend to accumulate in, and can even be targeted for, tumor blood vessels and that these structures may be more important for anti-cancer therapy than clonogenic cell death. Due to the short distance traveled by x-ray induced photoelectrons, the endothelial cells of the tumor will receive a sizable boost in dose, even for clinical megavoltage photon irradiation. We are proposing a therapy that would be highly compatible with current clinical practice and could offer a substantial clinical benefit. Upon the successful completion of the aims, we will have demonstrated the validity of two underlying premises: 1) gold nanoparticles can be effectively, and safely, targeted to the tumor endothelium, and 2) the incidence of endothelial cell apoptosis during radiotherapy will be highly correlated to the proximity and local concentrations of gold nanoparticles.           The goal of this project is the improvement of cancer therapy by employing gold nanoparticles, specifically targeted to tumor blood vessels, during radiation therapy. These nanoparticles will give off an extra radiation dose to their immediate surroundings during therapeutic irradiation. The ensuing collapse of the tumor vasculature could lead to large scale cancer cell death and potentially halt metastasis.

"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials     DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.  .               The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist.

"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.        Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This platform can be used for an assessment of LNM which is paramount for appropriate treatment planning.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,8230636,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'gray matter', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'programs', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,337641,0.11106242938424898
"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8334502,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2012,668129,0.04512695482265913
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research.

"Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors  7. Project Summary/Abstract  Salivary gland tumors constitute 1-6% of head and neck tumors numbering 3600 new cases per year in the US. Though rare, there are 37 histopathological malignant subtypes and 13 benign subtypes of salivary gland tumors, making it one of the most challenging tumors to diagnose. While surgery is the main modality of treatment, advance unresectable primary, recurrent and metastatic tumors are generally fatal. The rarity of the tumors and multiple histopathological subtypes generated major clinical challenges for the early detection, diagnosis, therapeutic interventions and prognosis of patients with salivary gland tumors.  This application addresses the missing gaps in salivary gland tumor research by advancing the basic and translational sciences. Our approach is to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of salivary gland tumors using the most advanced omics technologies coupled with advanced data and bioinformatics analysis to develop tissue-based biomarkers for salivary gland malignancy detection as well as the potential use of salivary biomarkers to screen/risk assess symptomatic patients for salivary gland malignancies. In additional a systems network analysis approach (Weighted-Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis, WGCNA) will be use to examine the derived omics databases to identify pivotal molecular pathways and gene targets for salivary gland malignancy development. Collective these approaches will lead to translational and mechanistic insights for salivary tumor development that can be further translated for clinical applications as well as mechanistic evaluations using rodent models for salivary gland carcinogenesis.  Six Specific Aims are in place to test the hypothesis in this application. Aim 1 is to procure fresh frozen malignant and benign parotid gland tissues from the UCLA Head & Neck Oncology Clinic. Aim 2 is to perform comprehensive profiling of parotid gland tumors' transcriptome; microRNA and epigenome using most advanced RNA sequencing and methylomics arrays. Aim 3 will perform statistical and bioinformatics analysis for the omics databases to select candidate biomarkers that can detect parotid gland malignancies. These candidate biomarkers will be pre-validated in Aim 4 in an independent cohort of parotid gland malignant and benign tumors. Aim 5 is to explore the hypothesis that tissue-based dysregulated biomarkers in malignant parotid glands are concordantly dysregulated in saliva of these patients. Finally Aim 6 is a systems network based analysis of the omics databases to identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are pivotal in the development of parotid gland malignancies. These pathway and targets outcome can be evaluated in future mechanistic studies in salivary gland malignancy development by rodent models or cell lines.  Our multidisciplinary research team has the expertise and track record to carry out the proposed molecular characterization of parotid gland tumors as well as expertise to carryout the mechanistic and translational next steps to fully materialize the goals of this RFA.  8. Relevance to Public Health Statement  Salivary gland tumors are rare. However, they are aggressive and fatal. Due to its rarity (1-6% of head and neck cancers) and the fact that there are 24 variants of salivary gland cancers and 13 variants of benign subtypes, clinical diagnosis of salivary gland tumor is one of the worst, hampering treatment decisions and prognostics outcomes of patients. This application takes the novel and impactful approach to generate the most comprehensive molecular profile of salivary gland tumors to develop molecular signatures of salivary gland malignancies, saliva based biomarkers for early detection of salivary gland cancers and informatics outcomes that will identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are involved in the mechanistic development of salivary gland malignancies. The outcomes of this application are molecular signatures of parotid gland cancer to assist clinical diagnosis; salivary biomarkers to assist early detection of salivary gland cancers and identified biological pathways and gene targets for mechanistic evaluation in rodent models for salivary gland tumor carcinogenesis.",Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors,8534892,R56DE023241,"['Abbreviations', 'Acinar Cell Carcinoma', 'Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma', 'Adenolymphoma', 'Basic Science', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of salivary gland', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Parotid Cancer', 'Parotid Gland', 'Parotid Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Public Health', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent Model', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms', 'Salivary Glands', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'abstracting', 'adenoma', 'antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'insight', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R56,2012,211387,0.03428959637105466
"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.",Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma,8271303,R01CA135509,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Angiogenesis Promoter', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Facies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'VHL mutation', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'angiogenesis', 'bHLH-PAS factor HLF', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer therapy', 'caspase-3', 'cell behavior', 'human FRAP1 protein', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'intercellular communication', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,447222,0.07112222408388871
"Enhancing tumor vascular damage with gold nanoparticles aided radiation therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent developments in anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting therapies as well as hypofractionated radiotherapy have shown the great potential of tumor vasculature as a therapeutic target for cancer medicine. We have an original idea for using targeted gold nanoparticles as vascular disruptive agents (VDA) in conjunction with clinical megavoltage photon beams. Unlike competing proposals, we recognize that gold nanoparticles tend to accumulate in, and can even be targeted for, tumor blood vessels and that these structures may be more important for anti-cancer therapy than clonogenic cell death. Due to the short distance traveled by x-ray induced photoelectrons, the endothelial cells of the tumor will receive a sizable boost in dose, even for clinical megavoltage photon irradiation. We are proposing a therapy that would be highly compatible with current clinical practice and could offer a substantial clinical benefit. Upon the successful completion of the aims, we will have demonstrated the validity of two underlying premises: 1) gold nanoparticles can be effectively, and safely, targeted to the tumor endothelium, and 2) the incidence of endothelial cell apoptosis during radiotherapy will be highly correlated to the proximity and local concentrations of gold nanoparticles.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is the improvement of cancer therapy by employing gold nanoparticles, specifically targeted to tumor blood vessels, during radiation therapy.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,8020024,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'gray matter', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'programs', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2011,337641,0.11106242938424898
"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8188738,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2011,671728,0.04512695482265913
"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care. What makes this project a ""grand opportunity"" is the pursuit of rapid progress through a highly multidisciplinary team that will draw on new advances in the areas of cell lineage behaviors, cancer stem cells, three-dimensional mathematical and computational modeling, and machine-learning.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down. We hypothesize that, within the details of how a tumor grows lie important clues about the nature of feedback processes-including those that still remain or may be re-activated. By describing how such clues can be found, we will be defining a new approach for predicting how individual tumors behave in cancer patients, and how they respond to different kinds of therapy.              Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,7760605,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'programs', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,341087,0.11106242938424898
"Computer Assisted Identification and Volumetric Analysis of Enhancing Components    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of volumetric change of enhancing tissue is regarded as an important parameter used by clinicians when seeking to monitor the response of brain neoplasms to therapy. Unfortunately, direct computation of enhancing volume requires the manual tracing and segmentation of areas of enhancement typically extending over multiple images, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and therefore impractical. Substitute methods are widely utilized (such as bi-directional measurements). Such surrogate measurements for tumor volume become problematic. Our long-term goal is to seek an objective, computer aided diagnostic (CAD) methodology for automatic computation of tumor (enhancing tissue) volume relevant for clinical decision making. Our hypothesis behind this project is that volume of enhancing tissue can be accurately measured through the use of advanced computer vision techniques, which will lead to an effective CAD system able to assist radiologists analyzing MR brain images.   The specific aims of the proposed project are 1) to improve the accuracy of the measurement of enhancing tissue by constructing high resolution 3D MR images and labeling enhancing tissue using learning based computer vision techniques, and 2) to develop a CAD system for enhancing tissue volume assessment using the designed techniques and evaluate the performance of the system on assisting radiologists for image interpretation.    We believe this system will be well suited for use in patients undergoing treatment protocols/clinical trials who require short term serial imaging. It will better enable radiologists to give accurate quantitative clinical information. If the proposed research is completed successfully, the determination of enhancing tissue volume will be significantly advanced. It will enable the radiologists to rapidly provide objective, accurate, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the tumor status. This will lead to a more rapid and reproducible assessment of neoplasm and therefore, hopefully influence patient outcomes in a positive way. The proposed research will also be applicable for usage on archived studies thereby enabling the volume of enhancing tissue to be calculated on these images as well.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors. Measurement methods currently being used are limited in accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency and hence we propose a method, if successful, will enable the computer to identify and measure brain tumors in a more automated fashion with improved accuracy.

"Multiresolution-fractal modeling for brain tumor detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI's long-term research goal is to develop a fully functional automated robust CAD tool for accurate  pediatric brain tumor volume segmentation and tracking over time. Note the current practice in brain tumor  volume segmentation involves manual tracing and segmentation of suspected tumor areas in multimodality MRI  which is time consuming, labor intensive, and may be imprecise.  In an effort to reduce cognitive sequelae, contemporary protocols employ risk-adapted therapy in which risk  stratification is based on volume of residual tumor after surgical resection and presence of metastatic disease at  diagnosis. Therefore, further improvement in cancer treatment outcome in children is unlikely to be achieved  without improved knowledge of tumor volume and classification among other factors. In addition, such automated  volume computation and tracking tool would be of value as an adjunct marker in following up patients with brain  tumors. This will, in turn, help the physicians to make important patient management decisions about surgery  planning, critical radiation treatment planning modifications, treatment field modifications, localized control, sites  of metastatic disease and post therapy response evaluation.  However, development of such automated and precise tumor volume segmentation CAD tool requires solution to  a few challenges such as detection of hard-to-detect brain tumor (small residual after surgery, poorly  enhanced, multi foci and irregularly shaped) and abnormalities (edema, necrosis, and larger resection  cavity due to surgery) detection and classification. This project aims at development, testing, and evaluation  of innovative techniques and tools that will assist feature-based detection, segmentation and classification of  brain tumor and a few specific abnormalities.} The specific aims of this project are: 1) Spline-multiresolution  wavelet-fractal feature extraction; 2) MR sequence-dependant feature fusion and tumor/abnormality size and  volume determination for improved detection; 3) Optimized feature fusion for improved tumor, tissue and  abnormality classification; and 4) Algorithm testing and validation. {If successful, our method will allow for the  automatic computation of brain tumors and abnormalities with improved accuracy, which can provide a rapid,  objective, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the disease.

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using gene expression profiling to discriminate 21 different tumor types with an accuracy of 88%. The performance of this classifier, however, was principally limited by the use of multiple platforms for analysis. This proposal seeks to build a new gene expression classifier on a single, commercially available, genome-wide oligonucleotide platform, with a focus on the most problematic primary and metastatic tumors of the liver. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we plan to validate the classifier with independent test sets that will also be profiled by standard IHC approaches; the results of molecular classification will then be compared head to head with standard pathological classification for accuracy of diagnosis. To further translate the technology, we will select core classifier genes and perform validation with real time quantitative PCR. Finally, the molecular classifiers will be tested using prospectively acquired biopsy samples on tissues of known and unknown sites of origin.           n/a",Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors,7903971,R01CA112215,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Antibodies', 'Biliary', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Line', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon', 'Colon Adenocarcinoma', 'Community Hospitals', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Endoscopy', 'Ensure', 'Esophageal', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hepatic', 'Histologic', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metastatic Adenocarcinoma', 'Metastatic Lesion', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Microfluidics', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'bile duct', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'performance site', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care. What makes this project a ""grand opportunity"" is the pursuit of rapid progress through a highly multidisciplinary team that will draw on new advances in the areas of cell lineage behaviors, cancer stem cells, three-dimensional mathematical and computational modeling, and machine-learning.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down. We hypothesize that, within the details of how a tumor grows lie important clues about the nature of feedback processes-including those that still remain or may be re-activated. By describing how such clues can be found, we will be defining a new approach for predicting how individual tumors behave in cancer patients, and how they respond to different kinds of therapy.              Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment.

"Computer Assisted Identification and Volumetric Analysis of Enhancing Components    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of volumetric change of enhancing tissue is regarded as an important parameter used by clinicians when seeking to monitor the response of brain neoplasms to therapy. Unfortunately, direct computation of enhancing volume requires the manual tracing and segmentation of areas of enhancement typically extending over multiple images, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and therefore impractical. Substitute methods are widely utilized (such as bi-directional measurements). Such surrogate measurements for tumor volume become problematic. Our long-term goal is to seek an objective, computer aided diagnostic (CAD) methodology for automatic computation of tumor (enhancing tissue) volume relevant for clinical decision making. Our hypothesis behind this project is that volume of enhancing tissue can be accurately measured through the use of advanced computer vision techniques, which will lead to an effective CAD system able to assist radiologists analyzing MR brain images.   The specific aims of the proposed project are 1) to improve the accuracy of the measurement of enhancing tissue by constructing high resolution 3D MR images and labeling enhancing tissue using learning based computer vision techniques, and 2) to develop a CAD system for enhancing tissue volume assessment using the designed techniques and evaluate the performance of the system on assisting radiologists for image interpretation.    We believe this system will be well suited for use in patients undergoing treatment protocols/clinical trials who require short term serial imaging. It will better enable radiologists to give accurate quantitative clinical information. If the proposed research is completed successfully, the determination of enhancing tissue volume will be significantly advanced. It will enable the radiologists to rapidly provide objective, accurate, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the tumor status. This will lead to a more rapid and reproducible assessment of neoplasm and therefore, hopefully influence patient outcomes in a positive way. The proposed research will also be applicable for usage on archived studies thereby enabling the volume of enhancing tissue to be calculated on these images as well.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors. Measurement methods currently being used are limited in accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency and hence we propose a method, if successful, will enable the computer to identify and measure brain tumors in a more automated fashion with improved accuracy.

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors PROVIDED.  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success.

Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers).

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis.

The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,7369127,R01NS042645,"['Aggressive course', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'image registration', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2008,344531,0.11106242938424898
"In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescence-based molecular Imaging in small animals is having a major impact on drug development and disease research. However, a significant challenge to imaging targeted fluorescent markers in vivo remains: unless the labeled regions are located superficially; localization, quantitation and host organ identification are impeded by the effects of light scattering and absorption. Orthotopic tumor and disease models are increasingly preferred over less biologically relevant subcutaneous xenografts. In such studies, substantial difficulties are encountered in longitudinal studies where animals are growing and are positioned differently for each measurement. We believe that a single imaging advance could address many of these issues, and advance the utility of in-vivo molecular imaging: an exact anatomical co-registration technique that does not rely on multimodal techniques. This proposal describes dynamic molecular imaging (DMI), an approach that can provide co-registered anatomical information by exploiting in-vivo pharmacokinetics of dyes in small animals in a simple and inexpensive way. We demonstrate that by acquiring a time-series of optical images during injection of an inert dye, we can repeatably and accurately delineate the major internal organs of mice using optical imaging alone. This is possible because each major organ is ""illuminated"" by the kinetics of dye passing through it in such a manner as to make it distinguishable from other structures. Spatiotemporal analysis can exploit these characteristic time courses to allow the body-surface representation of each organ to be visualized. These in- vivo anatomical maps can be overlaid onto simultaneously acquired images of a targeted molecular probe (detected and distinguished from the mapping dye via multispectral imaging techniques, if necessary) to significantly aid in identification of the probe's anatomical and physical location. Using CRi's existing and prototype 2D, ""2.5D"" and true 3D multispectral mouse imaging systems, we propose to test and refine a DMI approach. Based on our findings to date, we will examine and exploit in-vivo pharmacokinetics of the near-infrared dye, indocyanine green, to generate delineated surface projections of individual organs. Co-registering this surface map with surface projections of detected targeted labels will allow the targeted probe's 3D spatial location to be inferred. This information can further be used to improve quantitative accuracy in longitudinal molecular imaging studies of deep targets.           n/a",In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE),7485551,R43EB008627,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Body Surface', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Dyes', 'Fluorescence', 'General Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Animal Imaging Systems', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Visualization software', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Xenograft procedure', 'absorption', 'base', 'blind', 'data acquisition', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'longitudinal animal study', 'millimeter', 'molecular imaging', 'novel strategies', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'prototype', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'subcutaneous', 'tumor']",NIBIB,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R43,2008,167462,0.014503348261861131
"Chip Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using gene expression profiling to discriminate 21 different tumor types with an accuracy of 88%. The performance of this classifier, however, was principally limited by the use of multiple platforms for analysis. This proposal seeks to build a new gene expression classifier on a single, commercially available, genome-wide oligonucleotide platform, with a focus on the most problematic primary and metastatic tumors of the liver. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we plan to validate the classifier with independent test sets that will also be profiled by standard IHC approaches; the results of molecular classification will then be compared head to head with standard pathological classification for accuracy of diagnosis. To further translate the technology, we will select core classifier genes and perform validation with real time quantitative PCR.

"Sono-Contrast Induced Functional Imaging/Spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An innovative method of in vivo imaging for detection and pathophysiological classification of relatively superficial malignancies is proposed. The technique, sono-contrast induced functional imaging and spectroscopy (SCIFIS), builds upon existing diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in the near infrared region but uses standing wave focused ultrasound deposition as a contrast agent to improve the sensitivity and specificity of DRS. The overall goal is to develop a non-invasive, real-time modality for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and post-treatment surveillance.   The basis of the proposed in vivo imaging method is that acoustic radiation force delivered by focused ultrasound forming a standing wave causes reversible compression of the vasculature and/or blood flow stasis, and thus temporal changes in hemoglobin concentration, which are registered in the dynamic (pre- and post-insonification) observation of near-infrared spectra. By intersecting the optical path and the acoustic path at an angle and subtracting measured spectra pre- and post-deposition of sono-contrast, signatures of vascular pathophysiology can be identified at the intersecting location.   In the R21 phase, C3H mice inoculated with murine mammary tumors on the left legs will undergo in vivo SCIFIS measurement prior to immunohistochemical examination. Principal component analysis neural networks (PCANN) will be used in data analysis/correlation, leading to definitively tests of the underlying hypotheses via receiver operating characteristics analysis and statistical correlation of tumor detection and vascular distribution predictions.   In the R33 phase, clinical evaluation of the SCIFIS technique will commence following system optimization by Monte Carlo simulation. Non-invasive, in vivo acquisition of SCIFIS spectra will be collected in patients undergoing biopsy for suspicion of breast cancers.

"COMPUTING TUMOR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING The overall goal is to optimize the design of medical imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms for the purposes of tumor detection in humans and animals.  For imaging systems this is done by devising efficient methods to calculate the performance of ideal observers that use the noisy data from the system on realistic tumor detections tasks.  These methods make use of symmetries of the imaging system, consistency conditions on the data, and constraints on the objects to simplify the computations.  Noise models are chosen to reflect the measurement noise in the system, the background variation in the patient population, and the normal variation in tumor characteristics. Performance of ideal observers is determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.  For a given detection task, this performance is a function of the parameters in the system design.  By varying these parameters the optimal design for tumor detection is found by maximizing this figure of merit.  When the ideal observer performance is too difficult to compute, the ideal linear observer is substituted.  For reconstruction algorithms, the performance of linear mathematical observers using the reconstructed images for tumor detection tasks is computed.  These model observers are chosen to match the performance of human observers on similar tasks.  To compute the performance of these observers, the first-order and second-order statistics of the reconstructed images are calculated or approximated.  These statistical moments are then used to compute the signal-to-noise ratio for the model observer on the given tumor detection task.  Of particular interest is the role of redundant data and null functions of the imaging system in the deterministic and statistical properties of the reconstruction algorithms.  n/a",COMPUTING TUMOR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING,6776980,K01CA087017,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'performance', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K01,2004,147210,0.06494155755907882
"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes. During phase I we successfully completed all proposed feasibility studies to demonstrate SPECT/CT with gamma performance of 1.3mm intrinsic spatial resolution, E range from 30keV to 350keV, and,deltaE/E=12% at 140keV and - 100mu m CT capability from a 50xS0mm CMOS based digital x-ray detector. In addition, we acquired outstanding dual SPECT-CT images of euthanized mice. During the phase II project we will complete the integration of the high-resolution SPECT and transmission CT subsystems and develop all necessary hardware and software.

Non-invasive, in vivo acquisition of SCIFIS spectra will be collected in patients undergoing biopsy for suspicion of breast cancers. The predictive model based on PCANN will be quantitatively compared with pathological tissue diagnoses. In addition, response to radiation treatment and outcome will be correlated with angiogenesis and/or tumor hypoxia findings in the sonocontrast spectra for those patients who are found to have malignant diagnoses and eventually receive radiotherapy. n/a",Sono-Contrast Induced Functional Imaging/Spectroscopy,6783889,R21CA107860,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'hemoglobin', 'human subject', 'immunocytochemistry', 'infrared spectrometry', 'neoplasm /cancer blood supply', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optics', 'prognosis', 'reflection spectrometry', 'statistics /biometry', 'ultrasound']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2004,168212,0.024988805685026497

"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes. During phase I we successfully completed all proposed feasibility studies to demonstrate SPECT/CT with gamma performance of 1.3mm intrinsic spatial resolution, E range from 30keV to 350keV, and,deltaE/E=12% at 140keV and - 100mu m CT capability from a 50xS0mm CMOS based digital x-ray detector. In addition, we acquired outstanding dual SPECT-CT images of euthanized mice. During the phase II project we will complete the integration of the high-resolution SPECT and transmission CT subsystems and develop all necessary hardware and software. The result will be a fully functional dual-modality prototype scanner for anatomical and quantitative metabolic imaging of small animals.         n/a",Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging,6693866,R44RR016393,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' image processing', ' laboratory mouse', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' single photon emission computed tomography', ' technology /technique development', ' whole body imaging /scanning']",NCRR,"PHOTON IMAGING, INC.",R44,2003,379863,-0.005080106333162812

"Direct MALDI-ToF analysis of LCM-selected tissue & tumor DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to improve the quality of differential cancer diagnostics and metastatic tumor origination using protein and carbohydrate biomarker detection of patient biopsies, BioAnalyte Inc. and collaborators at MGH and JHMI propose to develop laser capture microdissection (LCM) as a sample preparation system for the biomolecular profiling capabilities of MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. The work will first optimize protocols for collecting cells from mammalian tissue for MALDI-ToF analysis. For differential diagnostics we will analyze several LCM-selected cells from the tumor collection at MGH representing a variety of cancers will be used to determine the MALDI-ToF profiles of transformed and adjoining normal tissue. For identification of a metastatic tumor with its primary, we will make MALDI-ToF MS profiles of LCM-selected cells from metastatic cancers and compare them to profiles of LCM-selected cells in the original tissue. New software about written for general MALDI-ToF chemometric analysis of profiles WII be implemented here to determine fingerprint regions of the mass spectra in each of its applications.

"CLINICAL CORRELATIVE STUDIES OF NEUROBLASTOMA DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract):  Neuroblastoma is the       most common extra cranial tumor of childhood, and cases are highly               heterogenous with regard to clinical behavior.  Although patient groups with     different expected survivals can be identified by clinical staging at            diagnosis, individual clinically defined risk groups include patients with       quite different outcomes.  Inter- and intra-stage diversity provides             opportunities for identifying molecular genetic and biologic properties of       tumors that are associated with treatment outcome.  Such correlations can        identify risk groups that otherwise are not recognizable, thus aiding in the     interpretation of clinical studies, and they can provide new criteria for        more appropriate therapy assignment.  They may also suggest new approaches       to therapy.  The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to develop tests      that improve definition of risk groups so that the most appropriate and          effective therapy can be given to each patient.                                                                                                                   The hypothesis of this application is that subsets of neuroblastomas can be      identified by evaluating (1) genes that are critically involved in               neuroblastoma growth, differentiation, and survival and (2) the ability of       tumor cells to grow continuously in vitro.  Plans are to build upon previous     studies of N-myc proto-oncogene expression in neuroblastoma and of the           neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, NGF, and brain derived neurotrophic          factor, BDNF) and their receptors (e.g., TrkAl), and of tumor cell growth in     vitro, which demonstrated the potential importance of these markers in           prognostication.                                                                                                                                                  The specific aims are as follows:  (1) determine if tumor phenotype defined      by MYCN gene amplification and expression, TrkA expression, telomerase RNA       expression, and growth in vitro correlates with disease progression during       or after therapy; (2) develop multivariate statistical models for predicting     outcome based upon clinical presentation (stage and age) and laboratory data     (tumor MYCN gene amplification, TrkA expression, telomerase RNA expression,      growth in vitro, and histopathology); (3) determine in a pilot study if          expression of other neurotrophins and their receptors defines risk groups.       If so, include these in the above analyses.                                                                                                                       The CCG performs phase III studies in which newly diagnosed patients receive     therapy according to risk classification, which is currently based upon          clinical stage, age, histopathology, and N-myc gene amplification status.        Approximately 200 patients are registered annually in studies for low,           intermediate, and high-risk neuroblastoma.  Tumor tissues including (in some     patients) bone marrow with tumor are obtained at diagnosis prospectively.        Tumors are tested to determine their phenotype with regard to N-myc              amplification, trk RNA expression level and pattern of expression, BDNF RNA      expression, telomerase RNA expression and activity, chromosome 1p deletions,     and tumor cell growth in vitro.  The goal is to determine if these               laboratory test results can identify clinically important but small subsets      of patients who may benefit from different therapy.  If preliminary studies      indicate that specific tests are particularly important in predicting            prognosis, large-scale studies will be conducted to better define the value      of these new tests (e.g., their ability to identify patients who will likely     fail treatment).                                                                                                                                                  It is anticipated that these studies will improve prognostication and that       they may contribute to development of novel and possibly more effective          therapies for high-risk patients, while diminishing the risks of treatment       for low risk patients.                                                            n/a",CLINICAL CORRELATIVE STUDIES OF NEUROBLASTOMA,6403183,R01CA060104,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' artificial intelligence', ' cancer risk', ' child (0-11)', ' clinical research', ' cooperative study', ' gene expression', ' growth factor receptors', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' loss of heterozygosity', ' mathematical model', ' molecular oncology', ' neoplasm /cancer chemotherapy', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neuroblastoma', ' neurotrophic factors', ' pediatric neoplasm /cancer', ' polymerase chain reaction', ' protooncogene', ' receptor expression', ' telomerase', ' telomere', ' tumor suppressor genes']",NCI,NATIONAL CHILDHOOD CANCER FOUNDATION,R01,2001,420741,0.04574453641322277
"3D Cerebral vessel location for surgical planning   DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from Applicant's Abstract): This proposal is a competing       renewal of a grant on 3D intracerebral vascular imaging. We intend to build          upon our earlier work by providing a clinically useful, symbolic description of      blood vessels supplying vascular CNS tumors, including both solid tumors and         arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). For both the surgeon and the                     interventionalist, it would be enormously valuable to provide a 3D map that          contains the tumor margins, that illustrates 3D parent-child vascular                connectivity information, that shows the relationship between arteries and           veins in AVMs, and that readily segregates vascular branches supplying a tumor       from branches supplying normal brain. These kinds of information are those that      the clinican most needs to know. Such information is not directly available to       clinicians by any current imaging methodology.                                                                                                                            The specific aims of this proposal include: 1) segmentation of solid tumors          from MR, 2) segmentation of AVMs from magnetic resonance angiograms (MRA) and        MR, 3) registration of MR with MRA data, 4) development of methods of vascular       desbription to separate arteries from veins and to delineate which arterial          branches (and descendents) supply only tumor and which supply brain, and 5)          tests of the accuracy and utility of our methodology.                                                                                                                     In addition to its clinical goals, this proposal aims to meet a number of            challenges in computer vision research, including tumor segmentation using a         range of cues, a statistical atlas based definition of named vessels, and            automated definition of vessel branchpoints. The methods we propose are              unavailable elsewhere and should be profoundly useful to clinicians. We propose      a number of studies to evaluate the accuracy and utility of our approach, and        we also propose new visualization methods to indicate the uncertainty of our         symbolic descriptions of image objects. n/a",3D Cerebral vessel location for surgical planning,6324990,R01CA067812,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' blood vessel disorder', ' brain neoplasms', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' cardiovascular surgery', ' cerebrovascular imaging /visualization', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' neoplasm /cancer blood supply', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer surgery', ' neurosurgery']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2001,355229,0.041342237076223545

"TISSUE AND SERUM INDICATORS OF LUNG CANCER RECURRENCE Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer morality       in men and women in the United States, and the overall long-term survial is      less than 15%.  Pathologic stage I makes up  25-35% of NSCLC cases and has       a good prognosis.  However, cancer relapse and death rate in this subset is      35 to 50% by 5 years.  Chemotherapy is beneficial for the treatment of           several localized solid tumors after resection and may prove to be useful        in the treatment of patients with stage I NSCLC.  Thr purpose of this            project is to define tissue and serum tumor markers in patients with stage       I NSCLC which predict for early cancer recurrence.  Pathologic stage I           NSCLC was chosen for study to eliminate the significant influence of             positive lymph nodes and distant metastases on survival.                         Immunohistochemical staining will identify potential tissue tumor markers        and radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will       identify potential serum tumor markers.                                                                                                                           Specific aim #1 will examine a set of twelve tissue tumor markers in a           retrospective cohort of 275 stage I NSCLC patients.  Markers are                 categorized by hypothetical method of action: molecular genetic markers          (Kras, erbB-1, erbB-2, rb, p53, bcl-2), markers of metastatic propensity         (angiogenesis factor viii), proliferation markers (K1-67) and markers of         cellular differentiation (Blood group A, H/LeV/LeB, NCAM, CD44).  Results        will be used to develop a prediction rule for recurrence in stage I NSCLC        using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and an artificial neural      network.                                                                                                                                                          Specific aim #2 will examine a set of eight serum tumor markers in a             retrospective cohort of 250 patients with stage I to IV NSCLC.  These            markers are categorized as molecular genetic markers (anti-p53), markers of      metastatic propensity (angiogenesis bFGF), somatamedins (growth factor IGF-      1) and markers of cellular differentiation (CEA, CA-125, CA 15-3, CYFRA21-       1, CD44).  The purpose of this aim is to identify any correlations between       titers of serum markers and tumor histology, stage or mass.  One hundred         patients in this cohort had a second serum collection after tumor                resection.  This subgroup of serum will allow analyses of titters before         and after cyto-reduction.  Significant correlates with tumor stage and mass      will be evaluated in a prospective cohort of patients with stage I NSCLC.                                                                                         In specific aim #3, paraffin-embedded and fresh-frozen tumor tissue will be      collected from a prospective cohort of 330 patients with stage I NSCLC to        validate the prediction rule developed in specific aim #1.  In these same        patients, serial serum specimens will be collected for a minimum of 2.0          years after resection (specific aim #4).  The significant markers                identified in specific aim #2 will be analyzed in this cohort to describe        correlations with tumor recurrence.  Tissue and serum markers identified by      the model can be used to select high risk patients for a prospective,            multi-institutional chemotherapy trial for stage I NSCLC.                         n/a",TISSUE AND SERUM INDICATORS OF LUNG CANCER RECURRENCE,6172943,R29CA073980,"['angiogenesis factor', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomarker', ' cell differentiation', ' clinical research', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', ' genetic markers', ' histopathology', ' human subject', ' immunocytochemistry', ' insulinlike growth factor', ' longitudinal human study', ' mathematical model', ' metastasis', ' neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' neoplasm /cancer relapse /recurrence', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer', ' prognosis', ' respiratory surgery', ' serology /serodiagnosis']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R29,2000,105136,0.02715101823759073

Plans are to build upon previous     studies of N-myc proto-oncogene expression in neuroblastoma and of the           neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, NGF, and brain derived neurotrophic          factor, BDNF) and their receptors (e.g., TrkAl), and of tumor cell growth in     vitro, which demonstrated the potential importance of these markers in           prognostication.                                                                                                                                                  The specific aims are as follows:  (1) determine if tumor phenotype defined      by MYCN gene amplification and expression, TrkA expression, telomerase RNA       expression, and growth in vitro correlates with disease progression during       or after therapy; (2) develop multivariate statistical models for predicting     outcome based upon clinical presentation (stage and age) and laboratory data     (tumor MYCN gene amplification, TrkA expression, telomerase RNA expression,      growth in vitro, and histopathology); (3) determine in a pilot study if          expression of other neurotrophins and their receptors defines risk groups.       If so, include these in the above analyses.                                                                                                                       The CCG performs phase III studies in which newly diagnosed patients receive     therapy according to risk classification, which is currently based upon          clinical stage, age, histopathology, and N-myc gene amplification status.        Approximately 200 patients are registered annually in studies for low,           intermediate, and high-risk neuroblastoma.  Tumor tissues including (in some     patients) bone marrow with tumor are obtained at diagnosis prospectively.        Tumors are tested to determine their phenotype with regard to N-myc              amplification, trk RNA expression level and pattern of expression, BDNF RNA      expression, telomerase RNA expression and activity, chromosome 1p deletions,     and tumor cell growth in vitro.  The goal is to determine if these               laboratory test results can identify clinically important but small subsets      of patients who may benefit from different therapy.  If preliminary studies      indicate that specific tests are particularly important in predicting            prognosis, large-scale studies will be conducted to better define the value      of these new tests (e.g., their ability to identify patients who will likely     fail treatment).                                                                                                                                                  It is anticipated that these studies will improve prognostication and that       they may contribute to development of novel and possibly more effective          therapies for high-risk patients, while diminishing the risks of treatment       for low risk patients.                                                            n/a",CLINICAL CORRELATIVE STUDIES OF NEUROBLASTOMA,6150147,R01CA060104,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' artificial intelligence', ' cancer risk', ' child (0-11)', ' clinical research', ' cooperative study', ' gene expression', ' growth factor receptors', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' loss of heterozygosity', ' mathematical model', ' molecular oncology', ' neoplasm /cancer chemotherapy', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neuroblastoma', ' neurotrophic factors', ' pediatric neoplasm /cancer', ' polymerase chain reaction', ' protooncogene', ' receptor expression', ' telomerase', ' telomere', ' tumor suppressor genes']",NCI,NATIONAL CHILDHOOD CANCER FOUNDATION,R01,2000,413515,0.04574453641322277
"CLINICAL CORRELATIVE STUDIES OF NEUROBLASTOMA DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract):  Neuroblastoma is the       most common extra cranial tumor of childhood, and cases are highly               heterogenous with regard to clinical behavior.  Although patient groups with     different expected survivals can be identified by clinical staging at            diagnosis, individual clinically defined risk groups include patients with       quite different outcomes.  Inter- and intra-stage diversity provides             opportunities for identifying molecular genetic and biologic properties of       tumors that are associated with treatment outcome.  Such correlations can        identify risk groups that otherwise are not recognizable, thus aiding in the     interpretation of clinical studies, and they can provide new criteria for        more appropriate therapy assignment.  They may also suggest new approaches       to therapy.  The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to develop tests      that improve definition of risk groups so that the most appropriate and          effective therapy can be given to each patient.

"Deep learning for renal tumor characterization Our long-term objective is to develop deep learning techniques capable of predicting characteristics and treatment response or response to surveillance to assist clinical decision- making in renal tumors that are potential candidates for ablation therapy, biopsy, active surveillance or surgical resection. An increasing number of renal tumors are being diagnosed, due in part to incidental detection from the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. Although partial nephrectomy is still considered the primary treatment for small renal masses, percutaneous ablation is increasingly performed as a therapeutic, nephron-sparing approach. One challenge for interventional radiologists and urologists who manage these patients is selection for therapy, since the average rate of progression is slow for small renal tumors and metastasis rarely occurs. A technique that could distinguish indolent tumors from those will progress based on data from the imaging methods used to detect and delineate renal masses would enable early triage to observation versus invasive treatment. Deep learning, a type of machine learning technique which takes raw images as input, and applies many layers of transformations to calculate an output signal, has already led to breakthroughs in other areas of image recognition, and is increasingly used for medical image analysis. However, its application in the field of interventional radiology is currently limited. Furthermore, no study in the literature has applied deep learning to kidney lesion segmentation and characteristics/outcome prediction. In this project, we propose to develop novel deep learning architectures based on routine MR imaging that allow for accurate renal mass segmentation and prediction of characteristics and outcome in renal tumors. Using data from four independent cohorts, we will use our deep learning architectures to predict (1) benign versus malignant histology (2) growth rate in stage 1a renal cell carcinoma (3) SSIGN score in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and (4) clinical endpoints. We will integrate segmentation and classification into one net that suitable for clinical application. In addition, we will compare results with those of experts and traditional machine learning approaches. The inability to determine aggressiveness of renal tumors based on pretreatment imaging makes it challenging for urologists or interventional radiologists to select appropriate patients for active surveillance versus therapy with nephrectomy or ablation. Our research project uses deep learning to distinguish renal mass from normal tissue and predict characteristics, treatment response or response to surveillance in renal tumors. By using a multi-institutional patient cohort and conventional MR imaging sequences, we will demonstrate the generalizability and broad applicability of our algorithm. Our models have the potential to help guide clinical management of patients with renal tumors.",Deep learning for renal tumor characterization,9968604,R03CA249554,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clear cell renal cell carcinoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dropout', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Kidney', 'Modeling', 'Nephrectomy', 'Nephrons', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal Mass', 'Research Project Grants', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Urologist', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'random forest', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R03,2020,80500,0.023647312445080757
"Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult brain tumor, with grim prognosis and heterogeneous molecular and imaging profiles. Although the currently applicable treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have expanded during the last 20 years, there is no substantial improvement in the OS rates. The major obstacle in treating GBM patients is the heterogeneity of their molecular landscape. Determination of molecular targets requires ex vivo postoperative tissue analyses, which are limited in assessing the tumor's spatial heterogeneity (sampling error due to single sample histopathological and molecular analysis) and temporal heterogeneity (not possible to continuously assess the molecular transformation of the tumor during treatment). Herein we propose to develop quantitative imaging phenomic (QIP) markers of a range of mutations of interest in GB. We will build on prior work on EGFR, IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation QIP signatures, and develop an extensive panel of imaging signatures of 10 gene mutations, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, using machine learning methods applied to relatively routine clinical mpMRI (standard plus diffusion tensor and perfusion protocols). Availability of such biomarkers can contribute to non-invasive i) patient stratification into appropriate treatments, ii) measurement of individual molecular characteristics. In particular, we propose to carry out the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To develop the enabling methodologies for constructing Quantitative Imaging Phenomic signatures of GB mutations Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Establish QIP signatures of 10 mutations of interest in gliomas, plus MGMT promoter status, using next generation sequencing (NGS). We will use 709 datasets. Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Characterize the molecular heterogeneity of GB using QIP signatures, leveraging the NGS samples of SA1, as well as a new sample that we will genotype, adding to a total of 600 tumor samples obtained from 4 different locations per patient from 150 patients. The first 150 tissue samples are already analyzed as part of ongoing work. Specific Aim 4 (SA4): Integrate our methods into the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk), in order to allow easy access to them by users This project will investigate the relationship between imaging characteristics of glioblastoma and its underlying genetic mutations/variants. As such, it aims to develop a number of imaging signatures of mutations that are important in GBM, using 1,159 (709 patients plus an additional 450 tissue samples of 150 of these patients obtained from different locations in the tumor) analyzed via next generation sequencing. The primary motivation of this work is to develop the imaging analytics methodologies and associated biomarkers that will allow us to evaluate the spatial, temporal and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma, thereby assisting in patient stratification and treatment.",Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning,9893291,R01NS042645,"['Adult', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiogenomics', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'genetic signature', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'phenomics', 'predictive signature', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'receptor', 'routine imaging', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,670422,0.05579072124043281
"Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary adult brain tumor with an incidence rate of 3.2 per 100,000 people. Due to its heterogeneous genetic characteristics, GBM carries a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of only 14 months and five-year survival rates are less than 10%. The current standard of care is maximal safe surgical resection, chemoradiation, and adjuvant temozolomide. Within the natural history of GBM, there are adaptive genetic changes within the tumor that lead to treatment resistance and inevitable recurrence, leading to patient death. While a variety of treatments can be administered for tumor recurrence, there is currently no consensus on therapy for recurrent tumor as none have been proven to provide substantial survival benefit. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. Rather, clinical decision-making is based on a manual and variable two- dimensional measure of tumor burden, a surrogate of tumor volume, and genetic characterization of select molecular markers at the time of initial surgery. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care. Thus, a critical need exists for automatic methods that non-invasively evaluate treatment efficacy on a patient-to-patient basis. To address this problem, we will develop a novel solution based on deep learning that leverages structural, diffusion, and perfusion information from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging. At the core of our solution is a convolutional neural network; a machine learning technique that can be trained on raw image data to predict clinical outputs of interest. Firstly, we will develop a fully automatic technique for longitudinal tracking of tumor volumes. To do this, we will develop novel deep learning architectures through incorporation of state-of-the-art neural network components that can segment both whole tumor and tumor subregions (edema, non-enhancing tumor, and gadolinium contrast-enhancing tumor). To prove algorithm utility, we will automatically derive tumor volumes in a longitudinal patient cohort and correlate volumes with clinical outcomes. Secondly, we will develop a non-invasive, deep learning algorithm for evaluation of regional genetic characteristics of GBM. To train this algorithm, we will acquire imaging-localized surgical biopsies and genetic profiling of GBM patients undergoing surgery. Once trained, the algorithm can be used to non- invasively identify clonal populations and track genetic changes associated with clinical outcomes during the course of treatment. The development of these deep learning algorithms will transform physician’s capacity for clinical decision-making and dramatically improve outcomes for a devastating disease. Project Narrative The proposed research will provide automatic deep-learning tools to aid clinical decision-making for glioblastoma, the most common primary adult brain tumor that carries a dismal prognosis. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment.

"Implementation of Machine Learning Workflows in Primary Brain Tumor Diagnostics Abstract The diagnosis of primary brain tumors requires a layered approach of histologic, anatomic and molecular features to generate an integrated diagnosis with clinical and prognostic significance. The diagnostic workup of diffuse gliomas in particular requires a panel of immunohistochemical stains with a subset of tumors requiring additional molecular testing to reach a diagnostic category recognized by the World Health Organization. In the United States and worldwide, scarce resources are available to perform these tests, so methods that improve pre-test probabilities and decrease false positive results have significant clinical and financial impact. Our long-term goal is to improve and standardize testing and diagnoses for brain tumor patients worldwide by validating new diagnostic workflows using digital imaging, immunohistochemical tests, open source computing platforms and machine learning algorithms to improve diagnostic capabilities. We will achieve these goals by completing three specific aims in this R03 Pilot/Feasibility project. First, we will determine the extent to which predictive diagnostic models developed from public domain data show generalizability to cases evaluated at a tertiary brain cancer care center. We have already generated a prototype statistical predictive model, which we will expand to all CNS tumor types and test with data from patients at James Cancer Hospital. Second, we will generate and validate models that predict the probability of false-positive 1p/19q FISH testing using histological features from OLIG2-immunostained brain tumor slides obtained from whole slide imaging. Lastly, we will consolidate data containing whole slide digital images, immunohistochemical features, clinical data and molecular features of diffuse gliomas. Consolidating these data will allow us to begin data analysis correlating histological images to immunohistochemical and molecular features. This dataset will represent the core dataset that upon which we will base our next R01-level proposal. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team composed of an image analysis expert and neuropathologist (JO), a molecular neuropathologist (DT), and a high dimensionality bioinformaticist (JZ). The Ohio State University is the first US cancer center to transition to complete whole slide imaging, and therefore we are in a unique position to generate a significant, vertical advance in improving diagnostic accuracy in neuropathology with modern Pathology Informatics approaches. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop predictive models of cancer diagnoses and consolidate various forms of patient data into one centralized source for research. This new knowledge will ultimately serve as the framework upon which interventions are designed that may improve morbidity and mortality of patients with primary brain tumors. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burdens of human disease.",Implementation of Machine Learning Workflows in Primary Brain Tumor Diagnostics,9954242,R03NS116334,"['19q', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'CDKN2A gene', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'FDA approved', 'Geographic state', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Ohio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Probability', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'World Health Organization', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'high dimensionality', 'histological image', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutant', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic significance', 'prototype', 'sequencing platform', 'therapy design', 'tumor', 'whole slide imaging']",NINDS,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,156000,0.03471111066749082
"Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one heterogeneous type of cancer affecting most organ systems. NETs must be correctly graded to ensure proper treatment and patient management. The proliferation index, as measured by Ki67 nuclear staining, is required for gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic NET grading per the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Measuring the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) from pathology images requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This process is an essential procedure in basic, translational and clinical research and in routine clinical practice. However, current Ki67 image analysis tools have a number of drawbacks: 1) Ki67 LI assessment is still mainly achieved with manual or semi-automated methods, leading to increased labor costs, awkward workflows, low-throughput image analysis and significant potential inter- and intra-observer variability; 2) computer-aided Ki67 counting is error-prone due to the multi-stage image processing design, where each stage itself is a very challenging task; 3) current algorithm design does not take into consideration the characteristics of Ki67 images such that it has technical difficulty in classifying different types of cells in Ki67 stained images. In this proposed research, we seek to develop and disseminate a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, KiNeT, specifically for better automated Ki67 LI measurement in GI and pancreatic NETs. KiNet will take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs), to develop an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel model for single-stage Ki67 LI assessment. To this end, we will first formulate Ki67 counting as a cell identification problem and solve it using class-aware structured regression modeling within a novel FCN network. This network will simultaneously detect and classify immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. Next, we will further enhance cell identification with another related task, extraction of regions of interest (ROIs), which will differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions by taking Ki67 image characteristics into consideration. These two tasks will be unified into one single neural network and jointly learned to benefit both cell identification and region classification. KiNet will provide a novel computational method for accurate Ki67 LI assessment, thereby enabling early detection and targeted treatments of the diseases. Compared to manual counting and current Ki67 image analysis methods, it will significantly improve the objectivity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility and efficiency. Additionally, the proposed single-stage Ki67 counting strategy, which is completely different from current multi-stage Ki67 image analysis pipelines, will provide a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ki67 labeling index (LI) is a reliable and critical biomarker to grade gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This biomarker computation requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells.

"Software Solution for Clinical Management of Musculoskeletal Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Bone lesions are frequently encountered during every day clinical practice. Benign bone lesions, such as a small enchondroma, can be left alone and are unlikely to impact the patient during their lifetime. However, a malignant bone lesion, such as an osteosarcoma, will require a biopsy and surgical resection. Determining which lesions require treatment and which can be left alone can be a daunting process. Whether a bone lesion requires a biopsy depends on both clinical- and imaging-based factors(1–3). Advanced patient age, presence of pain, and history of prior malignancy can influence the need for biopsy. For imaging, various lesion-based parameters such as location, matrix, tumor margin, presence of soft tissue component, and periosteal reaction can help determine whether the lesion is aggressive or non-aggressive, with aggressive lesions needing a biopsy. Aggressive lesions are more likely to represent a malignancy, althought there are some benign processes that can have an aggressive imaging appearance (i.e osteomyelitis, fractures).  Misdiagnoses of malignant tumors as benign prevents needed treatment from occurring; however, benign lesions should not be unnecessarily biopsied, as this can lead to unneeded tests, biopsy complications, increased health care costs, and patient anxiety. Currently, the decision to biopsy or not is made by the clinician, considering the clinical- and imaging-based factors, which can be very subjective. Studies have shown that misdiagnosis is higher if these cases are not discussed under multidisciplinary review with input from an orthopedic oncologist, radiologist, and pathologist. Also, if the imaging studies are not interpreted by subspecialty trained musculoskeletal (MSK) radiologists, reading discrepancy of up to 28% can occur. Moreover, a recent study by Zamora et al. showed that there is poor inter-observer agreement amongst experienced orthopedic oncologists for distinguishing enchondromas and chondrosarcomas, a common clinical dilemma.  Therefore, we propose to develop a method to analyze the radiologic studies directly, extract important lesion-based features of the bone tumors and auto-classify the lesions as non-aggressive or aggressive. By using CT scans from 200 biopsied bone lesions, utilizing a deep learning approach to extract image features and access to patients' clinical-based factors, we will develop a machine learning tool to differentiate between non- aggressive and aggressive tumors and compare the results to definitive histologic confirmation of disease. We hypothesize that the proposed machine learning based software will classify aggressive vs. non- aggressive lesions as accurately as definitive histologic confirmation of disease state. The aims of the study are to: 1) Develope bone and lesion segmentation and bone-lesion feature extraction software tools for physician classification; and 2) Develope a software tool to auto-classify femur lesions as either aggressive or non-aggressive. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Bone tumors are frequently encountered during every day clinical practice. Non-aggressive bone tumors can often be left alone. However, an aggressive bone tumor typically requires a biopsy and subsequent surgery. Determining which lesions require treatment and which can be left alone can be a daunting process. Therefore, our goal is to develop, test, and commercialize a software tool to aid in differentiating between aggressive and non-aggressive bone tumors.",Software Solution for Clinical Management of Musculoskeletal Tumors,10156765,R43CA254835,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Appearance', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Bone neoplasms', 'Chondroma', 'Chondrosarcoma', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Excision', 'Femur', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Israel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Methods', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'feature extraction', 'fracture risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'osteosarcoma', 'prevent', 'radiologist', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"BIOSENSICS, LLC",R43,2020,256000,-0.009906600647775527
"Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials Project Summary / Abstract In patients with lymphomas and other cancers, quantitative evaluation of the extent of tumor burden is im- portant for staging, restaging, and assessment of therapeutic response or relapse; yet measurement of overall tumor burden is challenging with current tools, particularly when lymph nodes are confluent or difficult to fully differentiate from surrounding structures. Precision medicine and novel therapeutics are emphasizing the need to introduce a risk-adapted approach to tailor appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients. The ability to quantitatively assess cancer phenotypes with functional and anatomical imaging that could efficiently and ac- curately map patients to gene expression profiling, clinical information, matching cohorts, and novel treatment regimens could potentially result in more optimal management of patients with cancer.  This Academic-Industry Partnership aims to translate recently developed technologies for semi- automated image segmentation and quantification of lymph nodes into robust tools and integrate them into an existing cloud-based system for management of multicenter oncology clinical trials. The ability to semi- automatically segment lymph node pathology with computed tomography (CT), as well as quantify nodal me- tabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) will enable comprehensive tracking of morphological and functional changes related to disease progression and treatment response.  Since 2004, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) has developed the Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC (PIM) platform to manage clinical trial image assessment workflows. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 consistently measured lymph node measurements in the TIMC database. The PIM system is used to make over 20,000 time point imaging assessments per year at eight NCI- designated Cancer Centers and aims to grow quickly by transitioning to a fully cloud-hosted system.  Given sufficient training data, state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technolo- gies can meet or even exceed human performance on specific imaging analysis tasks. Recent studies have indicated that AI-based lymph node segmentation from CT scans is nearing human performance levels, and we will extend and translate this work into a commercial tool. Specifically, our aim is to translate recent ad- vancements in AI-based segmentation into deployable services, and integrate these services into the clinical trial workflow. The proposed system will be designed to incorporate expert feedback provided by image ana- lysts and radiologists back into the ground truth dataset, allowing for continuous improvement in accuracy and clinical acceptance. We will extend our semi-automatic CT segmentation technologies to quantify lymph node metabolism in PET/CT, using lymphoma as the model disease. Integration of these technologies with PIM will provide an ongoing source of consistently measured quantitative data across a network of cancer centers. Project Narrative Advanced quantitative imaging is underutilized in oncologic clinical practice and research because the time investment entailed in manual lesion segmentation remains prohibitive. This partnership proposes to integrate machine learning based quantitative imaging tools into the existing Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC clinical trial image management system. We will use data from the centralized Tumor Imaging Metrics Core at the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to produce ground truth training data and develop semi-automated multimodali- ty lesion analysis for patients with cancer.",Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials,10003193,R01CA235589,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Goals', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Services', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Burden', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'glucose metabolism', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'lymph nodes', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'success', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,607952,0.030976159914686354
"Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response Abstract  The continuing goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective imaging-based strategies to personalize brain tumor treatment. Current Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria, which incorporate anatomic imaging only, are insufficient for distinguishing tumor from treatment effect (TE). Without definitive confirmation of tumor progression, no treatment changes are recommended for several months after standard therapies. Thus, patients are precluded from switching to potentially more effective therapies—a limitation that could be overcome with more reliable imaging techniques.  To this end, during the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated the feasibility of several quantitative imaging (QI) tools to reliably distinguish tumor from treatment effect and predict treatment response. These QI tools include a machine-learning approach to calibrate T1w images enabling the creation of quantitative delta T1 (qDT1) maps. The qDT1 enable the detection of true contrast enhancing lesion volume (CELV). The qDT1 together with our proven dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI methods, for determination of rCBV (relative cerebral blood volume), are used to generate a new biomarker, fractional tumor burden (FTB), to delineate the extent of tumor within CELV on a voxel-wise basis. These perfusion-based QI tools in combination with our diffusion MRI technology, which includes functional diffusion maps (FDMs) and more recently RSI (restriction spectrum imaging), provide a comprehensive assessment of brain tumor and its distinction from treatment effect.  Now, in order to translate this technology for use in clinical trials and daily practice, some final updates and clinical validation studies are needed as proposed here. First, to ease adoption and testing in the clinical setting improvements are proposed for the individual QI technologies along with the development of a streamlined workflow (Aim 1). To improve the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI and FTB biomarker, studies will be performed to confirm that a single-dose DSC-MRI method can replace the standard double-dose method without affecting the accuracy of rCBV or the creation of FTB maps (Aim 1.1). Also, registration and segmentation algorithms will be updated to include deformable registration and recent advances in deep learning for longitudinal reporting of CELV, non-enhancing lesion volumes (NELV) and each of the QI metrics (Aim 1.2). Finally, a streamlined workflow that incorporates these improvements will be created (Aim 1.3). The Aim 2 studies will test the QI tools and workflow using clinical trial data (Aim 2.1-2.2) and daily clinical practice (Aim 2.3-2.4).  Clinical validation of this new QI-RANO workflow, with evidence showing improved prediction in comparison to current measures, has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how brain tumor burden is assessed. Project Narrative The goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective quantitative imaging (QI)-based strategies to provide earlier indications of brain tumor treatment response than is currently available. The QI tools, which include novel quantitative measures of enhancing lesion (qDT1), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), fractional tumor burden (FTB) and functional diffusion maps (fDM) will be updated and validated in the context of clinical trials. Working in close collaboration with an industrial partner, the proven methods will be translated into a software platform for widespread use within the quantitative imaging network (QIN), and for both clinical trials and daily standard of care.",Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response,10006506,U01CA176110,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Update', 'Validation', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cerebral blood volume', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'validation studies']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,U01,2020,559217,0.05927080756655093
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9982672,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'random forest', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,601618,0.10689740792152955
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9895669,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'experimental arm', 'falls', 'feature extraction', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'secondary endpoint', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,486817,0.08714916535758481
"SBIR Phase I Topic 402 - Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Thermal ablation systems are typically accompanied by ablation treatment planning system to optimize the treatment outcome using pre-operative CT scan. Radiomics is a process of converting medical images into higher-dimensional data and subsequent mining of data to reveal underlying pathophysiology for enhancing clinical decision support making. Radiomics analysis have shown promises in capturing distinct tumor characteristics and predicting prognosis of the tumor. We propose innovative method to calculate microwave ablation zones by supplementing a bioheat transfer model of microwave tissue ablation with microwave sensitive radiomics features, which will generate more accurate and personalized ablation prediction leading to better treatment outcome. Inputs to the bioheat transfer modeling approach include the geometry of the target tumor, physical properties of the tissue, and dimensions of the microwave ablation applicator. The radiomics algorithm extracts properties of the targeted tumor’s size and shape, as well as texture from CT images. Therefore, shape, size, and texture data computed through 3D wavelets are employed as radiomics features for more accurate dose prediction. The proposed radiomics analysis is conducted in three stages: (1)automatic detection of candidate tumors, (2)automatic segmentation of a selected tumor, (3)extraction of features from the segmented tumor, (4)analysis of ablated tumor over period of time. n/a","SBIR Phase I Topic 402 - Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring",10269839,5N91020C00050,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Image', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiofrequency Interstitial Ablation', 'Shapes', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Texture', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer prevention', 'clinical decision support', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'feature extraction', 'innovation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'multidimensional data', 'outcome forecast', 'physical property', 'preclinical study', 'radiomics', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"PHENOMAPPER, LLC",N43,2020,398952,0.058913590720262865
"Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response ABSTRACT  Low-grade glioma is the most common brain tumor in children and often involves one or more structures of the anterior visual pathway (i.e., optic nerves, chiasm and tracts). Nearly 20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) will develop a low-grade glioma of the anterior visual pathway, which are called optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). NF1-OPGs are not amenable to surgical resection and can cause permanent vision loss ranging from a mild decline in visual acuity to complete blindness. Children with NF1-OPGs typically experience vision loss between 1 and 8 years of age and are monitored with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess disease progression. However, traditional two-dimensional (2D) measures of tumor size are not appropriate to assess change over time and how NF1-OPGs are responding to treatment.  Our proposal addresses the lack of robust and standardized quantitative imaging (QI) tools and methods needed for NF1-OPG clinical trials. We will develop and validate a novel three-dimensional (3D) MRI-based QI application for automated and comprehensive quantification of these unique pediatric tumors. We will use machine learning algorithms to accommodate MRI sequences from different manufacturers and protocols. We hypothesize that the novel QI application will accurately assess treatment response in clinical trials. In this project, we will validate our QI software and machine learning methods to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape using data from a phase 3 clinical trial of NF1-OPGs. From these measures, we will create methods to assess response to therapy that will enable physicians to make informed and objective treatment decisions.  Our specific aims are: 1) Develop a comprehensive QI application to perform accurate automated quantification of NF1-OPGs; 2) Determine and predict treatment response using our 3D QI measures of tumor volume; and 3) Validate our 3D QI measures using visual acuity outcomes.  Upon study completion, our QI application could transform clinical care for NF1-OPG by identifying the earliest time to determine a favorable versus unfavorable treatment response. The QI application's ability to accurately measure treatment response, along with harmonizing data across MRI manufacturers and protocols, will standardize imaging assessments essential to NF1-OPG clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In children with brain tumors impacting their vision, physicians have difficulty determining when the treatment is working. We will improve upon the very basic and often inaccurate human measurements of tumor size by developing quantitative imaging tools to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape.

"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9997854,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CTLA4 blockade', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'driver mutation', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2020,250795,0.07473717221739971
"Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients Project Summary  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new patients in the US every year. Standard of care therapies include stereotactic surgical resection, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. After initial treatment, patient monitoring is guided by standard MR imaging performed at routine intervals. Despite these rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15 months. Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in brain tumor patients can be challenging to interpret and is further confounded by interpretation variability. Accurate interpretation of imaging is particularly important during the post-treatment phase of patient care as it can help clinicians proactively manage disease through early, precise characterization of true tumor recurrence. Disease-specific structured reporting systems attempt to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS), developed at Emory University, is one such framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of follow-up imaging. While BT-RADS has had success with clinical adoptability, it still faces hurdles reducing interobserver variability and improving objective classification of disease state.  This proposed study addresses an unmet need for unbiased, quantitative metrics for robust, objective interpretation of follow-up imaging for GBM patients. Where previous evaluative methods used two-dimensional, representative MRI slices for evaluating the extent of tumor, we propose to develop a deep learning segmentation tool, accurately calculating volumes of tumor after surgical resection, and trained from our expansive database of patient data with contours manually drawn by radiation oncologists. Further, we propose to develop computationally advanced software for predicting disease progression building upon the clinically developed BT- RADS criteria. Such tools would assist physicians in caring for brain tumor patients through post-treatment surveillance and guide future clinical decision making. In addition, we believe these quantitative metrics would have unbounded potential in clinical trial settings where it may be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics for GBM. Therefore, these assistive tools will be tested on clinical trial data to determine if they are superior to conventional measurements alone.  A fundamental goal of this proposal is ensuring the quantitative tools we develop are applicable for clinicians in their daily lives. Therefore, an effort will be made to collaborate extensively with clinicians to house the algorithms in sleek, intuitive software for physicians to utilize. Through the multidisciplinary environment, high performance computing, and clinical resources we have available, we believe this proposal will be successful in developing clinically assistive tools for unbiased, objective monitoring of GBM patients in clinical settings and evaluation of novel therapies in research settings. Project Narrative  Follow-up imaging for glioblastoma patients is challenging to interpret due to subjectivity in evaluating disease state and overlap between treatment effects and tumor progression. More objective follow-up criteria are vital for sensitive and accurate monitoring of glioblastoma patients after initial treatment to ensure proactive management of disease and accurate characterization of tumor recurrence. This research proposal will develop user-friendly quantitative software for lesion segmentation and disease-state assessment, providing unbiased metrics for post-treatment patient monitoring and guidance of management decisions in clinical and research settings.",Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients,9911574,F31CA247564,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'aggressive therapy', 'automated image analysis', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'quantitative imaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.056235413839786766
"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution. The work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease.","A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue",10231018,UH3CA246633,"['Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freeze Drying', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Granuloma', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'Morphology', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Readiness', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'graphical user interface', 'high dimensionality', 'high resolution imaging', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'ion source', 'machine learning method', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'reagent standardization', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UH3,2020,700000,-0.007453110591650027
"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,9917724,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,312511,0.011874339574304069
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.

"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer",9947900,U01CA225431,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cetuximab', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunotherapy', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'drug discovery', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genomic signature', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'mutant', 'mutational status', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2020,609531,0.03664708338003332
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease.

"In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging ABSTRACT There is still great need in better characterizing new targeted therapies in vivo, especially prior to clinical translation. In this regard, preclinical molecular imaging is a central tool in the targeted drug development pipeline. However, there is still a lack of integrated imaging platforms that can enable longitudinal (multiple time points) and spatially-resolved monitoring of complex fingerprints including molecular, metabolic and functional signatures in the same tumor/subject. This new integrated multiplexing imaging platform will play a crucial role in the development of the next generation of targeted drugs and elucidating (multi-) drug resistance mechanisms. Recently, we have demonstrated the unique capabilities of optical imaging in quantifying receptor-target engagement in live subjects by leveraging fluorescence lifetime. This outstanding achievement was realized thanks to the combination of instrumental, algorithmic and biochemical innovations to enable, for the first time, whole-body time-resolved optical imaging based on structured light for 2D or 3D Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in live subjects. Herein, we will further impact the field of optical preclinical imaging and drug delivery assessment by 1) integrating a cutting-edge high-resolution, time-resolved SPAD array imager for improved photon collection efficiency, spatial resolution, and portability; 2) we will harness the latest developments in Deep Learning (DL) for ultra-fast, quantitative, but fitting/iterative inverse solver-free image formation, in both 2D and 3D providing image formation/processing solutions to facilitate multiplexed imaging; 3) we will implement new functionalities in our imaging platform to enable the concurrent longitudinal imaging of multiple clinically relevant target-receptor interactions (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals. NARRATIVE Following an ever increased focus on personalized medicine, there is a continuing need to develop preclinical molecular imaging modalities to guide the development and optimization of targeted therapies. This research program will combine novel time-resolved cameras as well as deep learning techniques to broaden the impact of macroscopic lifetime imaging with the overarching goal to facilitate multiplexed imaging for a comprehensive assessment of cellular delivery efficacy of multiple clinically relevant drugs (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as drug response via metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals.",In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging,9997447,R01CA250636,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Electronics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hemoglobin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging ligands', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'functional status', 'imager', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'targeted treatment', 'technological innovation', 'tomography', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly']",NCI,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,637634,0.028867363403132437
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,10000066,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,541899,0.049688892936678206
"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy,9897497,R01CA237210,"['Antibodies', 'Antitumor Response', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granzyme', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Inflammatory', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Peptidyltransferase', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Recombinants', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Protease', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'humanized mouse', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'perforin', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'pharmacodynamic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sortase', 'success', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,340630,0.04350047255321335
"Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies Multi-tissue platform for modeling systemic pathologies In our current UH2/UH3 grant, we have established an exceptionally strong scientific premise for developing a multi-tissue platform for modeling disease and testing drug safety and efficacy. We propose to establish a functional network of five tissue systems: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the same batch of iPS cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing circulating immune cells. We have already achieved unprecedented levels of maturity and physiologic function for these tissue systems. A key innovation in the proposal is in the biomimetic approach to functional integration, by (i) maintaining a local regulatory niche for each tissue, (ii) connecting tissue units by a common perfusate containing immune cells, and (iii) establishing endothelial barrier between the vascular and tissue compartments. The platform will be modular, configurable, PDMS-free and featuring real-time monitoring of cell and tissue functions. Another innovative component is in the integrated systems biology approach to the analysis of complex data sets in disease modeling. We hypothesize that the matured tissues in our platform connected by vascular flow can replicate the drug-induced, multi-organ, transcriptional, metabolic, and functional changes observed in patients. To test this hypothesis and validate the platform, we will investigate the widespread off-target effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat most human cancers. In the initial UG3 phase of the project, our goal is to validate the model by comparing tissue responses in the platform to those measured clinically. Aim 1 is to develop a configurable multi-tissue platform with vascular perfusion and immune cells. Aim 2 is to characterize the five interacting tissue systems, and demonstrate stable tissue phenotypes over 4 weeks of culture. Aim 3, representing a transient to UH3 phase of the project, is to demonstrate utility of the integrated disease model. In the UH3 phase of Aim 3, we will recapitulate high susceptibility to doxorubicin of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and study the disease and population diversity. Aim 4 is to evaluate drug delivery modalities, risk factors and cell-protective agents. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed for cross-validation and synthesis of comprehensive data generated in the platform. Aim 5 is to characterize the multi-tissue models of disease using a systems biology/bioengineering approach. Our overall goal is to deliver a commercial-ready platform formed from a single source of iPS cells, and demonstrate its value for predictive, patient-specific modeling of disease. Broader Impact The lack of predictive screening methods remains a critical barrier to bringing drugs to patients. We propose to establish a testing platform with five functionally connected tissue units: heart, liver, skin, bone and vasculature, all grown from the patient’s cells, and perfused with a blood substitute containing immune cells. To validate the platform, we will model the toxic effects of doxorubicin, the drug used to treat many human cancers.

"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The integration of a machine-learning algorithm will further provide precise and unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor ecosystem.",Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems,9981696,U01CA214411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomimetics', 'Biopsy', 'Bioreactors', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cetuximab', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidics', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Rest', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Derived', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'cytokine', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fluid flow', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic testing', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'side effect', 'survival outcome', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,742092,0.059984446402702694
"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs.

"A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials Project Summary/Abstract There has been a shift to greater use of neadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the clinical management of cancer. Often used in breast cancer to provide systemic treatment for possible or apparent metastatic disease, NACT also reduces the primary tumor size and facilitates breast conservation. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is an effective diagnostic for monitoring tumor regression. There are many methodologies being developed for monitoring cancer in vivo, including contrast agent washout, volumetry, and more recently correlating apparent diffusion coefficients and proton relaxation times to tumor staging. Such imaging biomarkers are predictive of the pathological complete response (pCR) outcome prior to surgery. This enables physicians to provide “evidence based” treatment modifications to reduce deleterious side effects and improve patient outcomes. To obtain quantitative data from MR images, the variations that occur in imaging as a result of hardware and software differences between MRI manufacturers and day-to-day operations must be quantified. In MRI, the data depends on the protocols used to acquire the image, resulting in inconsistencies if even one parameter in the protocol changes. The goal of the proposed work is to produce and develop and disseminate a ground truth physical standard and quality control program for comparison of MRI scanners in the multisite I-SPY2 (ACRIN 6698) trials monitoring pre-operative chemotherapy treatments in the reduction of tumor size. The physical standard is an anthropomorphic breast phantom capable of fitting into all commercial breast coils. It contains novel human tissue mimics and geometric standards with values traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Analysis software capable of protocol compliance checks, rapid identification of the regions of interest, and comparison to ground truth values as measured by NIST will be developed to complement the physical standard. This will enable qualification of sites and quantification of error resulting from scanner performance alone. Given the wide breadth of parameter space that MRI protocols encompass, part of the proposed effort will include the development of protocols specific to image acquisition of tumor volumes and for measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient within the tumor volumes as compared to surrounding healthy tissue. Project Narrative: Quantitative imaging complements precision medicine initiatives by providing a noninvasive method of monitoring gene specific in vivo treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to neurological disorders. To realize quantitative imaging, variations in imaging hardware, software, and procedures must be mitigated. This project will develop a quality assurance and quality control procedure for multisite clinical trials involved in monitoring therapeutic efficacy using MR breast imaging.",A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials,10018825,R44CA235820,"['Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Breast conservation', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diffusion', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Volume', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cloud based', 'computer aided detection', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'human tissue', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'nervous system disorder', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'operation', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'side effect', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,"CALIBERMRI, INC.",R44,2020,183388,0.0034412638452884286
"The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration ABSTRACT: Accurate segmentation of solid tumors is challenging, due to their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location, as well as their appearance variation caused by the diversity of medical imaging. Manual annotation is tedious, prone to misinterpretation, human error, and observer bias. All these factors hinder further image analysis towards understanding tumor radio-phenotypes, predicting clinical outcomes, and monitoring progression patterns. Computational competitions have been seeking optimal advanced computational segmentation algorithms (ACSAs) for specific abnormalities, by pooling multi-institutional data together and benchmarking ACSAs from international groups. Along these lines, we have been successfully leading the organization of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, since 2012, towards a publicly-available pooled dataset of 542 multi-parametric MRI scans of glioma patients from 19 institutions. In the summarized analysis of all BraTS results, we have shown that although individual ACSAs do not outperform the gold standard agreement across expert clinicians, their fusion does outperform it, in terms of both accuracy and consistency across subjects. Towards the wider application of these ACSAs, in 2017 we created the BraTS algorithmic repository to make available Docker containers of individual ACSAs, created by BraTS participants. However, fusion of these ACSAs is still out of reach for clinical researchers, as there is no graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate it, and execution of such algorithms requires substantial computational background by the user. Furthermore, although competitions such as BraTS have shown promise, they cannot easily scale due to the requirement of pooling patient data from multiple institutions to a single location, that often faces legal, privacy, and data-ownership concerns. These concerns motivate distributed learning solutions, where the data are always retained within their institutions. We have been investigating such solutions to avoid the current paradigm of multi-institutional collaboration, i.e., data-sharing, and considering their potential multi-institutional adoption, with respect to privacy, scalability, and performance, we found federated learning (FL) to be most appropriate. In FL, each institution trains a model and shares it (without patient data) with an aggregation server, which then integrates institutional models in parallel and distributes back a consensus model. In this proposal, we focus on developing the open- source Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform, which with a user-friendly GUI will aim at i) bringing pre- trained models of various ACSAs and their fusion closer to clinical experts, and ii) allowing secure multi- institutional collaborations via FL to improve these pre-trained models without sharing patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges. Successful completion of this project will lead to an easy-to-use potentially-translatable tool enabling easy, fast, objective, repeatable and accurate tumor segmentation, without requiring a computational background by the user, and while facilitating further analysis of tumor radio-phenotypes towards accelerating discovery. NARRATIVE: Successful completion of this project will lead to a clinically translatable, easy-to-use software tool that offers a) pre-trained tumor segmentation models and their fusion, to perform better than experts, and b) a federated learning framework facilitating secure multi-institutional collaborations to improve these pre-trained models without the need to share patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges, towards accelerating research of cancer radio-phenotypes.",The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration,10009302,U01CA242871,"['Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Docking', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Observer Variation', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Radio', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm training', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'contrast enhanced', 'graphical user interface', 'human error', 'improved', 'interactive tool', 'light weight', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'repository', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U01,2020,360393,0.047729257432494926

"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,9856137,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effector T cell', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,74758,0.010872384128942977
"Comprehensive Assessment of Cancer Immunotherapy Response Project Summary  Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICIs) immunotherapies can result in robust and durable disease control in many advanced malignancies, and their use is transforming cancer care. Despite the growing adoption, however, ICIs are effective in <30% of patients and can cause significant immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in up to ~60% of treated patients. Early determination of which patient will respond and/or develop irAEs remains a great challenge due to the complex interplay of tumor response, toxicity in critical organs, and overall patterns of immune activation. Further complicating their use, ICI costs are high ($100k-$250k annually/patient; total Medicare Part B payment for ICIs in 2018 >$4 billion). A comprehensive assessment of early ICI therapeutic response and toxicity would provide oncologists with timely, actionable information to better balance benefits and risks, improve patient outcomes, reduce toxicities and lower healthcare costs.  Molecular imaging is an invaluable tool for assessing spatial and temporal changes in tumors, damage to critical organs and immune activation during immunotherapies. Unfortunately, current assessments require manually evaluating a subset of disease sites, which is both laborious and subjective. Immunotherapies’ unique mechanism of action often gives rise to novel imaging patterns of tumor response (e.g. pseudoprogression) that cannot be easily resolved by current methods. Disease response, organ toxicity, and lymphoid tissue immune activation are interdependent. Information on all three of these aspects of response must be known to capture the complete landscape of immunotherapy response. The status quo in assessing response not only fails to fully extract clinically significant information from the imaging data, but also provides very limited information to medical oncologists for improved overall patient management. To address this unmet need, AIQ Solutions (Madison, WI) proposes to develop ImmunIQ , a software product that provides a comprehensive view of immunotherapy response. Specifically, ImmunIQ will automatically and simultaneously assess: (1) response of all tumor lesions, (2) immune-related toxicities in critical organs, and (3) immune activation. Upon successful completion of Phase I, we will have a functional software prototype. In Phase II, we will clinically validate the platform with outcome and irAE data and develop a prototype ready for commercialization and FDA 510(k) submission. Project Narrative Immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies have been transforming the treatment strategies in many advanced malignancies, however despite the growing adoption, it suffers from significant challenges, including low response rate, high incidence of immune-related adverse events, and high treatment costs.

"Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  A major challenge in the management of advanced ovarian cancer is the presence of disseminated microscopic tumor nodules within the intraperitoneal cavity. Despite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, as many as 50% of patients can show occult disseminated disease, with only a 43% survival rate. Furthermore, systemic chemotherapy can have toxic side effects. Thus, recent efforts have aimed at improving detection and treatment of micromets. Chemophototherapy (CPT), the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, is an emerging cancer treatment modality that can provide synergistic efficacy of both therapies. The overall goal is to implement a quantitative laparoscopic imaging and treatment approach for advanced detection of micromets and optimization of CPT for targeted destruction of ovarian micromets and reduced toxic side effects. Quantitative fluorescence laparoscopic imaging will provide high sensitivity and resolution for detecting micromets as well as image guided drug delivery. Folate receptor alpha (FA) will be used as a promising target because it is highly specific of epithelial ovarian cancer. The proposed targeted CPT compound has a ~6-fold tumor-specificity providing enhanced fluorescence contrast. These folate-targeted, porphyrin-phospholipid doped liposomes are triggered directly by near infrared (NIR) light. This activates the anti-cancer photosensitizer outer layer and releases the anti-cancer agent Doxorubicin (Dox). While this nanocarrier is expected to improve detection of micromets, tissue absorption and scattering in living tissue can confound fluorescence contrast. Quantitative imaging based on spatial frequency domain imaging can eliminate these confounding effects and provide quantitative contrasts to enable more sensitive detection compared to raw fluorescence or white light visualization. Furthermore, this quantitative capability can function in near-real-time to provide feedback on drug release, thus allowing image-guided optimization of treatment light to ensure full drug release within each tumor. In Aim 1, a wide-field dual-channel laparoscope, fast quantification algorithms and targeted liposomal nano-construct will be implemented and optimized. In Aim 2, the platform will be validated in vivo for improved detection of micromets vs. raw fluorescence and white light. In Aim 3, the platform’s efficacy will be validated in vivo for destroying micromets in targeted tumors while reducing toxicity to surrounding normal tissues. Successful completion of this approach is expected to result in improved detection and treatment of micromets with reduced side effects. This is ultimately expected to lead to reduced recurrence rates and overall improved survival. Although this imaging approach focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment, it can be applicable to a wide range of epithelial diseases, such as oral, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers. NARRATIVE A quantitative laparoscopic spatial frequency domain imaging platform is proposed to map intraperitoneal ovarian metastases as well as to treat them effectively via targeted chemo-photo therapy. Cancer-targeting drug and optimized light delivery will allow local release and preferential uptake of the drug into tumors versus normal tissue for optimal cancer cell destruction with minimal side effects to the surrounding normal tissue. This approach is relevant to public health as it is expected to significantly improve detection and destruction of micromets in ovarian cancer patients, and reduce side effects in normal tissue, thereby fulfilling the overarching goal of improving patients’ survival rates and quality of life.",Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases,10058694,R01CA243164,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biodistribution', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial ovarian cancer', 'Epithelium', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'FOLR1 gene', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Folic Acid', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Laparoscopes', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Liposomal Doxorubicin', 'Liposomes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Maps', 'Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm to the Ovary', 'Micrometastasis', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nodule', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian Carcinoma', 'PUVA Photochemotherapy', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phospholipids', 'Photosensitization', 'Photosensitizing Agents', 'Phototherapy', 'Physiological', 'Platinum', 'Porphyrins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'anti-cancer', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'contrast enhanced', 'controlled release', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided drug delivery', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'intraperitoneal', 'liposome vector', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'nano', 'nanocarrier', 'nanomedicine', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'phantom model', 'quantitative imaging', 'side effect', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity', 'uptake']",NCI,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,340883,0.016700433170583295
"In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections Summary Extent-of-resection is correlated with glioma patient outcomes such as progression-free survival. Image- guidance technologies, based on MRI and now fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), have been developed to improve the surgeon’s ability to visualize gross tumor margins. However, there are fundamental limitations to wide-field imaging methods such as MRI and FGS, such as poor sensitivity to detect disseminated tumor cells at the infiltrative margins of diffuse gliomas, as well as the non-quantitative and subjective nature of image interpretation. With the emergence of FGS using 5-ALA, and its recent approval by the FDA in 2017, the gap between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) patients, in terms of extent of resection, will likely widen since LGGs rarely generate sufficient PpIX fluorescence to be detected via wide-field FGS. Consequently, there is a clear need for improved intraoperative techniques with the sensitivity to detect and quantify residual LGGs at the margins of the tumor cavity in order to improve the extent of resection and delay recurrence. We have shown that high-resolution confocal microscopy has the sensitivity to visualize the sparse sub-cellular expression of PpIX in LGG patients treated with 5-ALA, even beyond the radiographic margins. Therefore, we will optimize a handheld optical-sectioning microscope to image 5-ALA-induced PpIX at the final resection margins in LGG patients, together with real-time video mosaicking to facilitate the imaging of large tissue areas, which will minimize sampling bias when imaging heterogeneous brain tissues (Aim 1). In order to facilitate the clinical acceptance of these techniques, we will establish a relationship between the microscopic patterns of PpIX expression and well-established biological metrics such as tumor burden and proliferative index (Aim 2). Finally, we will explore the hypothesis that quantitative microscopic imaging of PpIX of the resection margins is predictive of extent of resection, as currently defined by post-operative MRI, which would suggest that it has value for optimizing resections to minimize and/or delay recurrence (Aim 3). Collectively, these results will pave the way for future randomized controlled clinical studies to optimize resection procedures and outcomes for LGG patients (adults and children), many of whom can have good survival outcomes and quality of life. Relevance to public health We are developing a set of technologies to enable real-time intraoperative microscopy of the final resection margins of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients who have been administered with 5-ALA prior to surgery (FDA approved in 2017). These quantitative and sensitive imaging techniques have the potential to improve the extent of resection for LGG patients, and therefore to improve patient outcomes such as overall survival and progression-free survival (time to recurrence).",In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections,9859167,R01CA244170,"['Adult', 'Aminolevulinic Acid', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biophotonics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Glioma', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Institutes', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proliferation Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sterility', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Burden', 'Validation', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'lens', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'overexpression', 'prototype', 'survival outcome', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,607334,0.027399975118196643
"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9981710,R01CA234557,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow', 'COL1A2 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cancer Patient', 'Castration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Indolent', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Oncogenic', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'androgen sensitive', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'cell stroma', 'clinically significant', 'conditioning', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome editing', 'host neoplasm interaction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'molecular oncology', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer metastasis', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'response', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,488621,-0.033828223184529556
"A Statistical Physics Framework for Understanding the Role of Repeat RNA in Tumor Immunity PROJECT SUMMARY Transcriptional dysregulation in tumors can induce the abundant expression of repetitive elements in cancerous cells compared to normal tissues, where they are often transcriptionally silent. Such transcripts have been associated with better outcomes to cancer immunotherapies, as they can modulate the tumor immune microenvironment and generate an under-quantified source of tumor neoantigens. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA is both a critical mechanism for initiating the immune response in the tumor microenvironment and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets. Using a set of approaches from statistical physics, our team predicted repetitive element RNA directly stimulates receptors of the innate immune system, confirmed this hypothesis in a key subset of immune cells, and showed repeat expression can correlate with response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Repeat RNA is therefore both a novel biomarker for the innate immune response in cancer and a potential therapeutic target to modulate tumor immunity. We will utilize a set of tools, developed by our team, from statistical physics to characterize repeat RNA recognition by innate immune receptors in silico and their role in tumor-immune co-evolution, both with and without the application of immunotherapy (Aim 1). Next, we will characterize the spatial context of repeat RNAs in the tumor immune microenvironment and the co-localization of predicted immunostimulatory RNA with activation of immune signaling, along with in depth immune-phenotyping of the state of the immune microenvironment in vivo (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform functional validation of our predictions on human immune cells to validate mechanisms of recognition and the specific immune subsets responsible for repeat recognition via a set of in vitro assays (Aim 3). Our goal is to use approaches from statistical physics to quantify the role of repetitive elements in tumor immunology, their rules of recognition by innate immune receptors and their part in facilitating cytolytic T cell activity. In doing so we will combine novel RNA detection technologies to study their spatial distribution and localization in cancers; state of the art immune-phenotyping; and mathematical models to characterize their direct role in tumor evolution. We hypothesize that our approach from statistical physics will identify the key structural and sequence features of repeat mediated immune activation in solid tumors and shed light on their specific consequences for tumor evolution and therapeutic efficacy. PROJECT NARRATIVE An emerging paradigm in cancer immunology states that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA in cancer is a critical mechanism for engaging tumor intrinsic and extrinsic immune and regulatory factors, and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets. Using a set of approaches from statistical physics, our team predicted repeat RNA stimulates receptors of the innate immune system, confirmed this hypothesis in a key subset of immune cells, and showed classes of repeat RNA can correlate with response to immunotherapies.

"Deciphering the System-Wide Immune Response to Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, resulting in dramatic anti-tumor responses in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% show any survival benefit, and of these it is not clear what predicts response. ICIs have been thought to work primarily through reactivation of exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CD8s) residing within the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. Recent work, however, indicates that various CD4+ T cell populations outside the tumor microenvironment (peripheral immune system) likely play critical roles in carrying out anti-tumor immune responses. Given increasing evidence that immune cells other than CD8s are important for anti-tumor immunity, it is critical to identify and characterize these cells in order to understand their roles during HNSCC tumorigenesis and ICI therapy, which are currently unknown. This proposal by Dr. Kyle Jones, DDS, PhD seeks to significantly advance our understanding of cancer immunology in the context of HNSCC tumors, with the ultimate goal of improving existing ICI therapies and developing new treatment strategies. With the assistance of a multi-disciplinary mentoring team, he will use a novel systems biology approach to accomplish the following Aims: (AIM 1) Quantify the effects that HNSCC tumors have on systemic immunity and determine if these changes are conserved across tumor, blood, and regional lymph nodes; (AIM 2) Determine how the ICI atezolizumab alters the intratumoral and peripheral immune states of HNSCC patients and if these changes are associated with tumor response to therapy. These Aims will define how HNSCC tumors alter the composition and function of patients' immune systems at single cell and systems levels as well as identify/characterize the specific immune cells that contribute to anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones will use high throughput single-cell methods such as mass cytometry, multiplexed ion beam imaging, and single-cell RNAseq along with established analytic pipelines on HNSCC patient specimens obtained before and after ICI therapy. The innovation of this approach, which permits simultaneous study of all immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, will reveal how changes in any individual immune cell population affects the overall immune state. It will also be important for the discovery of additional immune cell populations and biomarkers associated with HNSCC anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones's long-term career goal is to become an expert, leader, and independent translational scientist in the fields of head and neck cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Through this K23 award, he will obtain the additional training in experimental immunology, single cell analysis methods, computer programming, advanced statistical methods, and career development he needs to successfully achieve this goal.

"Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tissue based cancer research and therapy development are significantly challenged by strong tumor heterogeneity, biased information derived from two-dimensional tissue sections, spatially distorted genetic biomarker profiles in tissue space, and lack of dynamic Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) characterizations, presenting a serious barrier to enhance cancer research and treatment. Informatics tools for three- dimensional (3D) digital pathology imaging data capturing both histology hallmarks and molecular biomarkers from both static and dynamic environments are promising to create longitudinal human tumor atlas, necessary for in-depth TME and its progression study. We, therefore, propose to create a scalable and effective 3D digital pathology analytics framework for large-scale 3D pathology imaging data, providing novel and accessible methods on pathology image integration, analysis, visualization, and 3D spatial pathology/biomarker data query for efficient test and discovery of spatial interactions of 3D pathology and biomarker objects in cancer research and targeted therapy development.",Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,9980817,U01CA242936,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Online Systems', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Visualization', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'web app']",NCI,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,374477,0.03503244214227041
