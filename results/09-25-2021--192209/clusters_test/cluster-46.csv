"Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients ABSTRACT Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. The goal of acute ischemic stroke therapy is to salvage tissue that is at risk of infarction, but still viable, through the use of reperfusion strategies. Current reperfusion therapies are limited by a tight time window for treatment and by the potential risk of brain hemorrhage. Using this time-based approach, only a limited number of stroke patients are eligible for treatment. Patients who present beyond the standard treatment time windows can benefit from therapy when identified based on multimodal MRI; however, precise and accurate identification of the salvageable tissue is essential, as the potential beneficial effect of treatment must be weighed against the risk of hemorrhage. Although a diffusion/perfusion MRI mismatch has been suggested as a guide with which to identify the presence of salvageable tissues and to serve as a selection marker for thrombolysis, the results of clinical trials using this criterion have been inconclusive, in part because of the inclusion of regions of oligemia in the penumbra, which overestimates the size of the tissue at risk. Amide proton transfer (APT) MRI has shown promise in detecting such an acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in animal models and in human stroke patients. However, most currently used APT imaging protocols are not very practical and not optimized with respect to the magnitude of signal changes caused by the pH effect. More quantitative APT-MRI typically would require an even longer scan time due to the use of multiple RF saturation frequencies, multiple acquisitions, and a long RF saturation pulse (or pulse train), all of which hamper clinical translation due to the very small time-window between stroke onset and possible thrombolysis treatment. Our long-term goal is to develop an ultrafast pH imaging technique for routine clinical use to guide reperfusion therapies for hyperacute stroke patients at various therapeutic time windows, as well as predict the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) following acute ischemic stroke. The first clinical hypothesis is that, similar to animal studies, the pH imaging penumbra due to ischemic tissue acidosis predicts the maximum final infarction size if no reperfusion is initiated. Our second clinical hypothesis is that the presence of severe tissue acidosis in the ischemic core is associated with an increased probability of secondary HT. Our hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims: 1) to develop and optimize an ultrafast quantitative pH imaging method; 2) to validate this technique and assess the diagnostic accuracy of the acidosis-based ischemic penumbra in a clinical setting; and 3) to develop a novel deep-learning model with which to predict HT following acute ischemic stroke, and quantify the sensitivity and specificity of pH imaging. This work is expected to accelerate the translation of APT-MRI into a clinically viable and robust method. The addition of pH imaging to the standard MRI protocol is expected to enable better visualization of the true ischemic penumbra, thus improving predictions of clinical outcome and reducing the incidence of HT. NARRATIVE This research proposal is designed to optimize the speed and evaluate the accuracy of a novel pH MRI technique for identifying stroke patients with salvageable brain regions, as well as patients at increased risk for developing hemorrhage after an acute ischemic stroke. The results would enhance patient selection for treatment, extend the therapeutic time window, and improve the risk-benefit ratio of recanalization therapies.",Ultrafast Quantitative pH MRI for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients,10102290,R01NS112242,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acidosis', 'Acute', 'Alteplase', 'Amides', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Decision Making', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Infarction', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Ischemic Penumbra', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research Proposals', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'detection sensitivity', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'endovascular thrombectomy', 'human imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'predict clinical outcome', 'radio frequency', 'risk benefit ratio', 'standard care', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombolysis', 'time use', 'treatment effect']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,384813
"Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform Project Summary / Abstract  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. Most recovery of functional impairments occurs within the first few weeks after stroke and plateaus thereafter. Unfortunately, even after patients reach a stable phase of recovery, their functional level of the stroke-affected limb may decline. Therefore, it is clinically important to maintain the regained functional level beyond the first couple weeks of spontaneous recovery by continuing to practice the use of the affected limb during daily living.  Wearable technologies have emerged as a low-cost, objective tool to monitor the performance of the upper limbs during activities of daily living (ADLs). However, to date, there exists no study that has investigated the effectiveness of a mobile-health (mHealth) system aiming to enable high-dosage motor performance in chronic stroke survivors in the real-world setting. Specifically, the optimal configuration of the goal setting, feedback mechanism and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) remains unknown.  This proposal aims to develop and validate an mHealth technology that aims to encourage affected limb use during the performance of ADLs in chronic stroke survivors. To accomplish this goal, we will employ the unique finger-worn ring sensor (accelerometer), developed by our academic-industry partnership, that can capture both gross-arm and fine-hand use of the limbs that are essential in the performance of ADLs. We will study important aspects of making positive behavior changes to encourage the affected limb use by fully leveraging the computational insights drawn from sensor data combined with clinical insights from providers.  To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on the development of an mHealth platform, composed of body-networked sensors and cloud-based systems, to monitor the real-world use of the limbs in chronic stroke survivors. In Aim 2, we will develop machine-learning based algorithms to extract clinically meaningful information regarding real-world upper limb use from sensor data. Aim 3 will investigate the optimal design of our mHealth system – such as individual tailoring of the goal, design of the feedback, medium and timing to deliver feedback, and ways to share data among the stakeholders (patients and clinicians) – via human-centered design approaches. Finally, in Aim 4, we will validate the short-term (8 weeks) effectiveness of the mHealth system in improving the use of the affected limb through a field deployment study.  We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable a high dosage of physical and occupational therapy, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative  Upper-limb paresis is the most common impairment following a stroke affecting 75% of stroke survivors, which can be more prominent in one of the two limbs. It is clinically important that stroke survivors continue to practice the use of the stroke-affected limb in their home and community settings to maintain the functional level learned in the clinic, but currently, there exists no effective, practical clinical tool. In this project, we propose to develop and validate an mHealth technology that will monitor real-world upper limb activity by leveraging our novel finger-worn accelerometer sensors and provide individually-tailored feedback to encourage affected limb use.",Achieving Optimal Motor Function in Stroke Survivors via a Human-Centered Approach to Design an mHealth Platform,10222670,R01EB027777,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Brachial Paresis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Fingers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'Network-based', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Technology', 'Upper Extremity', 'Upper limb movement', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'chronic stroke', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'community setting', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'functional disability', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'mHealth', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'personalized management', 'post stroke', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'upper limb hemiparesis', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'web platform']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2021,493221
"Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS) The current U.S. and European guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. However, selection of antiplatelet agents can be a difficult decision to make for older patients. Not only older individuals are at increased risk for recurrent strokes, they also face risk for bleeding complications. While it is known that drug selection should be individualized, it remains unknown how to tailor antiplatelet therapy according to patient unique characteristics, preferences, needs, and values. The long-term goal is to use com- parative effectiveness research to improve primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease and stroke. Leveraging the American Heart Association (AHA) Get With The Guidelines Stroke (GWTG) registry and Medicare claims, the overall objective in this application is to develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The central hypothesis is that individuals differ in many characteristics, such as age, sex, presence of comorbid- ities, or concurrent medications, which can influence the potential benefits and harms associated with the treat- ment. Once the variability in response to treatment is known, selection of an antiplatelet agent can be made based on patient risk profiles, preferences, and known efficacy/safety of the agents, making treatment both safer and more effective. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the long-term clinical effectiveness of different antiplatelet regimens in patients with noncar- dioembolic ischemic stroke; 2) determine the long-term safety of different antiplatelet regimens; and 3) balance benefits and harms of each antiplatelet regimen while incorporating patient preferences into decision-making. The proposed research is innovative in four key ways: 1) a patient-centered approach is used to address a real- life decisional dilemma facing stroke survivors and clinicians; 2) it shifts focus from selected samples in clinical trials to nationwide representative stroke population, including traditionally underrepresented subgroups in com- munity practice; 3) novel propensity score inverse probability weighting method using generalized boosted mod- els (a machine learning technique) will be employed to mimic a trial-type multi-treatment design, uncover treat- ment heterogeneity, and minimize selection bias in observational data; 4) beyond traditional mechanisms of scientific publications, the evidence generated from this study will be disseminated to stroke survivors, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders through the AHA GWTG-led national quality initiatives and patient-led efforts to insure a rapid translation of seminal findings into clinical practice. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to help guide personalized antiplatelet therapy in older ischemic stroke survivors that could best meet their needs and lead to better outcomes most meaningful to patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the poten- tial to inform evidence-based treatment decisions in stroke that now afflicts more than 7.2 million Americans. The proposed research will develop patient-centered evidence-based strategies to improve antiplatelet treatment selection for older individuals presenting with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. It is relevant to public health because the development and adoption of personalized evidence-based antiplatelet therapy is expected to re- duce recurrent ischemic events, minimize treatment complications, and improve outcomes most meaningful to patients. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing funda- mental knowledge that will help to enhance health and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.",Antiplatelet in Stroke:  Safety and Effectiveness in Seniors (ASSESS),10104421,R01AG062770,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Aspirin', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Coagulation Process', 'Community Practice', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'European', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Selection Bias', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Seminal', 'Societies', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'clinical practice', 'clopidogrel', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness analysis', 'disability', 'effectiveness outcome', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'preference', 'prevent', 'safety outcomes', 'sex', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,509566
"Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device Project Summary: Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are common causes of death and permanent disability worldwide, costing the U.S. health system more than $71 billion per year in lost productivity and medical expenses. Existing paradigms for stroke/TBI diagnosis require computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to classify ischemic versus hemorrhagic variants prior to intervention, as treatment for these conditions varies widely. Delays in diagnosis and issues related to transport of unstable patients associated with diagnostic imaging increase the likelihood of neurological injury and death. Translational medical devices that accelerate time-to-treatment in the field or hospital setting may help to reduce morbidity and mortality in stroke/TBI patients on a global level. Our team has developed a portable, rapid and noninvasive imaging and detection device based on eddy current damping (ECD) sensors that can detect brain hemorrhages associated with stroke and TBI, and have demonstrated feasibility in a benchtop, human cadaver and clinical patient setting. This device can potentially diagnose and classify hemorrhagic stroke/TBI subtypes with accurate spatial localization in minutes, rather than hours, thereby guiding early responders and medical providers in making time-sensitive medical decisions for clinical intervention, such as administration of tissue plasminogen activator for ischemic stroke. Our overall goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel stroke detection device in rapidly triaging stroke/TBI patients and achieving a level of diagnostic accuracy capable of guiding clinical intervention. We hypothesize that: 1) Regional conductivity changes in brain tissue can be imaged and detected using the portable ECD sensor; 2) Hemorrhagic stroke and TBI-related hemorrhages will increase regional conductivity, whereas ischemic stroke will decrease dependent brain conductivity in affected ischemic regions; and 3) Portable stroke imaging may reduce time-to-treatment and diagnosis associated with stroke/TBI. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) Perform benchtop laboratory experiments to further elucidate how direction and magnitude of measured conductivity changes can differentiate stroke subtype and location, 2) Use validated human cadaver stroke simulation models to optimize ECD tri-coil array sensor detection of hemorrhage depth, volume, and location, 3) Utilize machine learning algorithms to quickly classify brain lesions with high accuracy, and 4) Implement early clinical stroke/TBI ECD sensor device testing to gauge effectiveness in live human patients, compared to CT/MR imaging. Development of methods for rapid bedside stroke/TBI diagnosis will provide practitioners with knowledge required to rapidly administer life-saving treatments, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this will help to reduce time-to-treatment and guide triage and intervention, which is likely to translate to improved morbidity and mortality associated with these common conditions. Project Narrative Stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are leading causes of major disability and death, and delays in diagnosis and treatment are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Current diagnostic standards in stroke and TBI require that patients undergo computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in a hospital setting to differentiate ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes before initiating treatment. Our study proposes to develop a portable, noninvasive stroke/TBI detection and imaging system based on tri-coil eddy current damping technology, thereby rapidly identifying stroke subtypes, accelerating time-to-treatment, and providing early responders with information necessary to more efficiently administer triaged and appropriate intervention in the field or acute care setting.",Noninvasive transcranial detection of intracranial hemorrhage using a tri-coil handheld portable eddy current damping imaging device,10100064,R01NS119596,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alteplase', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomic Models', 'Brain', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cadaver', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coma', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Gelatin', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological emergencies', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute care', 'base', 'brain parenchyma', 'brain tissue', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'cranium', 'detection platform', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging detection', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'ischemic lesion', 'laboratory experiment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'meetings', 'method development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid technique', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'stroke model', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,408993
"Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) Nearly 800,000 people in the United States (US) each year are affected by stroke, which remains the leading cause of adult disability and 5th leading cause of death. Despite the proliferation of stroke centers nationwide, access to timely stroke care and evidence-based therapies is still poor with multiple inefficiencies, redundancies, errors, and system-based barriers that lead to care fragmentation. A stroke system of care that integrates and coordinates care between non-stroke center hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers has been recommended since it would reduce stroke-related deaths by 20,000 annually in the US and nearly 400,000 worldwide. This proposal is significant because it addresses two important gaps in knowledge about the acute evaluation and treatment of stroke patients: prehospital screening errors and delays in inter-hospital transfer. The Enhancing Stroke Prehospital and Emergency Evaluation and Delivery (E-SPEED) study will (1) enhance existing LVO screening tools, assess whether machine learning approaches improve LVO prediction, and evaluate the impact of an Enhanced LVO Screening Tool in the prehospital setting; and (2) use learning collaboratives and simulations to design, implement, and pilot test a new inter-hospital stroke transfer protocol. We bring together systems engineers and stroke health service researchers in a novel collaboration that will produce generalizable knowledge that can be widely applied to other urban regions of the country and provide preliminary data and demonstration of novel approaches that could be evaluated in large-scale comparative effectiveness studies across multiple regions. NARRATIVE Timely acute stroke treatments can be life-saving and reduce disability from stroke; however, a minority of patients receive these treatments in a timely manner or at all.

"Longitudinal and quantitative MR plaque imaging for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis ABSTRACT Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke worldwide. Despite intensive medical management, the current standard of care for secondary stroke prevention, the rate of recurrent stroke is 13% in the first year and as high as 35% in certain populations by 2 years. Currently, the initial and follow-up evaluations of these patients rely exclusively on assessments of clinical risk factors and, in some circumstances, the degree of luminal stenosis on imaging. However, this strategy may overlook subtle non-luminal changes within ICAD lesions. A tool that can directly probe atherosclerotic plaques and accurately quantify longitudinal changes of plaque features may help early identify non-responsive patients in whom an alternative therapy can be initiated. Magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging (VWI) has the potential to fulfill this role because of its compacity to directly visualize the vessel wall and characterize plaque features. However, there are several technical challenges associated with intracranial VWI: small size, tortuous course, and deep sitting warrant a high-resolution and 3D imaging approach; multiple lesion sites require a large imaging view; signals arising from neighboring blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to be adequately suppressed; relatively long imaging time and potential image corruption by patient motion; and lack of dedicated plaque analysis tools particularly for 3D dataset. In this proposal, we will develop a reliable 3D VWI- based MR plaque imaging (MRPI) strategy for prediction of response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD. Specifically, we will first develop a whole-brain 3D VWI sequence with intracranial vessel-dedicated motion compensation and motion-adaptive imaging acceleration (Aim1-Task1) and develop an automated intracranial vessel wall (IVA) tool integrating 3D vessel wall segmentation and computational algorithms for deriving quantitative plaque features (Aim1-Task2) followed by a validation study (Aim1-Task3). The validated techniques will then be used in a cross-sectional study to determine the MRPI-derived quantitative plaque features that are associated with ICAD lesions within the infarcted territory in patients with acute symptomatic ICAD (Aim 2). We will finally conduct a longitudinal study to determine the capacity of longitudinal and quantitative MRPI to predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients (Aim 3). Successful completion of the project will validate the compacity of VWI-based MRPI to quantitatively characterize ICAD and predict response to medical management in symptomatic ICAD patients. This will open the door to future clinical trials investigating the role of MRPI in developing personalized management paradigms and assessing new therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atherosclerosis in the brain is an important cause of ischemic stroke worldwide and carries a high risk of recurrent stroke despite treatment.

"Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) Summary: Overall section Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States, making it a major public health concern (1). Approximately a quarter of all chronic stroke survivors present with aphasia, a language disorder caused by damage to the speech and language areas of the brain (3, 4). In a recently published report, Simmons-Mackie (1) estimates that over two million people in North America are currently living with aphasia. Stroke is typically thought to affect older persons; however, the incidence of stroke in younger individuals has been steadily increasing (2). In fact, at least half of all stroke patients in the state of South Carolina are under the age of 60 (2). Aphasia can vary in severity from very profound impairment that renders patients mute and without the ability to understand others’ speech, to milder forms where patients have great difficulty retrieving specific words. In the chronic stage of stroke, aphasia has been identified as the strongest predictor of poor quality of life. Aphasia not only influences the ability to communicate with family and friends, but also drastically decreases education and employment opportunities. Although some degree of spontaneous recovery from aphasia is typical in the first weeks and months following stroke, many patients are left with devastating communication problems and never fully recover. To address the need for studies improving long-term outcomes in aphasia, the Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR), funded for just under four years at the time of this application, has made great progress towards understanding the mechanisms that promote spontaneous and therapy-induced recovery in aphasia. The overarching goal of the research proposed in this renewal application is to maintain our focus on aphasia therapy. Specifically, during the next funding phase, the focus of C-STAR is to improve access to aphasia therapy, enhance the effect of behavioral aphasia therapy to promote an improved aphasia therapy outcome, and understand overall health and neurolinguistic factors that influence aphasia recovery. To accomplish our research goals, this project will continue to rely on collaboration among five main investigators: Drs. Julius Fridriksson, Argye Hillis, Leonardo Bonilha, Chris Rorden, and Greg Hickok. Projects led by Fridriksson (chronic patients) and Hillis (acute patients) will continue to focus on factors that may promote improved outcome of aphasia therapy. Both projects have proven successful in yielding a vast, unique dataset including measures of brain status and response to aphasia therapy. Relying on this dataset, Bonilha and Rorden’s project will focus on the relationship between brain health and recovery from aphasia, whereas Hickok will utilize the same data to better understand aphasic impairment in relation to aphasia therapy success as well as new neurolinguistic models of speech and language processing. Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the United States; aphasia, an impairment of the ability to process language, is one of the most devastating results of left hemisphere stroke. The purpose of the work proposed here is to improve recovery from aphasia by expanding access to therapy by using telerehabilitation and by understanding the effects of drug therapy, brain health, and neurolinguistic factors on the outcome of aphasia therapy.",Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR),10094377,P50DC014664,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anodes', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biography', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Double-blind trial', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Employment Opportunities', 'Enrollment', 'Escitalopram', 'Family', 'Financial Support', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phase I/II Clinical Trial', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severities', 'South Carolina', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'chronic stroke', 'disability', 'double-blind placebo controlled trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'language processing', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'speech processing', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'success', 'syntax', 'telerehabilitation', 'therapy outcome']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,P50,2021,2558826
"Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke Project Summary / Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations that preclude their long-term use. In the proposed, “Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation Real-Time in Stroke,” Study, our overall objective is to enhance paroxysmal AF (pAF) detection by enhancing and testing Pulsewatch, an innovative, smartwatch-based technology for long-term rhythm monitoring of stroke patients. For Aim 1, we embed our state-of-the art AF detection algorithms, interactive messaging to promote adherence, and novel contact and motion noise correction capabilities into a smartwatch to enable near-continuous pulse waveform analysis. We will further refine Pulsewatch through focus groups and a Hack-a-thon with stroke patients and their medical providers. For Aim 2, we will enroll 90 stroke survivors and provide them with a smartphone and smartwatch, both encoded with Pulsewatch. We will compare the performance of Pulsewatch when worn daily for 7 days to conventional 7-day cardiac monitoring for pAF detection. For Aim 3, we will determine the acceptability and usability of Pulsewatch through follow-up interviews and focus groups in 30 randomly selected participants from Aim 2 asked to continue wearing smartwatch daily for an additional 30 days. We will identify patient factors associated with adherence and evaluate the impact of Pulsewatch use on disease-specific quality of life, anxiety, and self- activation among the 30 users compared to 30 stroke patients treated with usual care through baseline and 1- month assessments. Our research will lead to the development of a highly acceptable, enabling cardiovascular monitoring technology designed by, and for, stroke patients that facilitates long-term non-invasive screening for pAF, as well as communication between stroke patients and their medical providers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the world’s most common serious heart rhythm problem and causes 15% of all strokes, a major cause of disability and death among Americans. Long-term monitoring for early AF detection and treatment is recommended for many stroke patients, but although existing cardiac monitors are accurate, they suffer from methodologic and cost limitations. Accordingly, we propose a series of prospective investigations involving stroke patients and their medical providers focused on developing, validating, and field-testing a new smartwatch-based AF detection platform, Pulsewatch, to create a mobile technology that can detect paroxysms of AF, accelerate their treatment, is user-centric, and is of great intrinsic acceptability.",Smartwatch Monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation After Stroke,10124424,R01HL137734,"['Adherence', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cryptogenic stroke', 'design', 'detection platform', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'lens', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'post stroke', 'preference', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'stroke patient', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,731023
"A Machine Learning Approach to Classifying Time Since Stroke using Medical Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) is the dominant and most proven treatment option, but its use is only indicated within 4.5 hours following a stroke. Unfortunately, up to 30% of stroke patients present with an unknown time since stroke (TSS) symptom onset, which makes them ineligible to receive IV tPA. Many of these individuals could be spared severe morbidity or mortality if there existed an alternative method for establishing TSS, allowing them to be identified and treated. This proposal will develop machine learning methods to create a physiologically grounded method for predicting TSS based on multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging data. We believe our proposed techniques will outperform state-of-the-art methods that are based on subjective image interpretation, and have the potential to provide an objective data point that may be used in conjunction with the subjective assessments of experts, or in clinical environments that lack expertise in stroke imaging Research has established that MR and CT imaging captures information that correlates with TSS. However, existing methods for extracting this information are based on a physician subjectively interpreting the images and delineating regions of interest, processes that have been documented to have only weak to moderate agreement across trained expert reviewers. An automated approach that comprehensively analyzes the spectrum of imaging data could identify complex relationships across channels that more accurately classify TSS. For example, in MR, diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging all play important roles in characterizing a stroke, but a deep understanding of how each channel may be combined to describe TSS is unknown. We propose to establish new deep learning methods for fusing this information. Specifically, we will: 1) develop a machine learning framework for classifying TSS; 2) develop a deep convolutional autoencoder to generate novel multimodal image representations from MR and CT to improve classification; and 3) implement visualization techniques that elucidate the relationship between deep features and pathophysiological stroke processes. Under this project, we will use data from the UCLA and UCI Stroke Centers, allowing us to study different patient populations and imaging techniques. The successful completion of this research will provide a new method for estimating TSS from imaging, leading to new prospective trials for providing therapy to patients with unknown TSS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 Americans experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each year; however patients who present with an unknown stroke onset time are ineli- gible for receiving the leading therapy.

"Detecting bleeding events using EHRs for prediction in Afib Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions of mostly older Americans. Atrial fibrillation contributes to stroke and weighing stroke risk against risk of bleeding from oral anticoagulants (AC) is central to AF management. AC decision-making has become more complex in recent years with the introduction of several target specific oral AC agents. It remains challenging to advise older AF patients about AC since they are frequently at high risk for stroke and complications from AC, particularly bleeding, and data are limited on real-world outcomes of AC among vulnerable populations. Our project, Detecting bleeding Events using Electronic records for Prediction in Atrial Fibrillation (DEEP AF), will leverage novel biomedical natural language processing (NLP) approaches to integrate bleeding-related information from both the structured and unstructured EHR records and statistical and deep learning approaches to predict risk of bleeding on AF patients on AC therapy. DEEP AF will address present knowledge gaps to accurately identify bleeding events from longitudinal electronic health records and to improve bleeding prediction accuracy and focus on modifiable, clinically relevant risk factors, thereby facilitating future large-scale comparative effectiveness studies evaluating AC agents, and helping clinicians develop better approaches to weighing AC risks and benefits.

"Deep Learning Enabled Endovascular Stroke Therapy Screening in Community Hospitals Project Summary/Abstract Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States. Endovascular stroke therapy (EST) has revolutionized the management of large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke (AIS), which accounts for a disproportionate amount of disability in stroke. While this therapy has been shown to significantly improve clinical outcomes in multiple clinical trials, these studies nearly all required screening patients with advanced NeuroImaging such as CT Perfusion (CTP), a modality not available to the majority of community hospitals. As such, there is a pressing need to for a tool able to identify EST candidates leveraging the infrastructure already existing in community hospitals. We envision a software-based service to automate the NeuroImaging evaluation for EST using CT angiography (CTA). We developed and tested a prototype of a novel deep neural network architecture called DeepSymNet. Our preliminary data indicate that uniquely using CTAs we can determine (1) the presence or absence of a large vessel occlusion (2) if the extent of ischemic core and (3) volume of tissue “at risk” (penumbra) is above or below the thresholds used in the clinical trials, when compared to concurrently obtained results using CTP. We will pursue our project goal with three aims: - Aim 1 - Establish one of the largest multi-institution dataset for neuro-imaging research in acute ischemic stroke. We will acquire a multi-center dataset including imaging and clinical data from 15 hospitals across Texas and California, from a range of scanners, imaging acquisition protocols, and hospital types (i.e. large academic and smaller community). - Aim 2 - Develop interpretable deep learning models to determine the eligibility for EST. We will methodically test a set of model architectures, data augmentation strategies, loss functions and pre-processing steps based on DeepSymNet. We will train and test the algorithm against various definitions of infarct core and penumbral volume based on CTP results. This approach will allow for models adaptable to the everchanging definition of EST eligibility.  – Aim 3 - Evaluate the external validity of DeepSymNet-based models on a large multi-center independent dataset. To accomplish this aim, we will deploy our DeepSymNet software on patient imaging and data from multiple hospitals, which were not used in the creation of the software. We will also validate our approach of using CTA alone to determine ischemic core by validating blinded reads of infarct core from CTA source images performed by expert readers against concurrently acquired CTP results. Completion of these aims will have a sustained, transformative impact by supporting the creation and validation of decision support tools readily translatable to the patient bedside in the vast majority of community hospitals across the country. In doing so, we hope to expand the access to high-quality EST screening to thousands of additional AIS patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE With endovascular stroke therapy, we now have the ability to dramatically improve patient outcomes after stroke. To date, however, screening for patients that may benefit from this procedure has been relegated to larger academic centers, as the advanced imaging modalities required for this evaluation are not widely available. The goal of our proposal is to develop and validate machine learning-based software tools to identify patients eligible for endovascular stroke therapy using CT angiography, an imaging modality readily available in the vast majority of community hospitals.",Deep Learning Enabled Endovascular Stroke Therapy Screening in Community Hospitals,10184809,R01NS121154,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Referrals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry Standard', 'Infarction', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Therapy Evaluation', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomedical referral center', 'brain tissue', 'care delivery', 'community center', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disability', 'heterogenous data', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'perfusion imaging', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'screening', 'sex', 'stroke patient', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'support tools', 'thrombolysis', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2021,481432
"Neural Correlates of Recovery from Aphasia After Stroke Project Summary/Abstract Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is, functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies, we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two complementary cohorts of patients—acute and chronic—longitudinally using the same multimodal functional and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent, as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia. Project Narrative Aphasia (acquired language impairment) is one of the most common consequences of stroke and often leads to significant long-term disability. This project seeks to better characterize the neural correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes.

"Data Harmonization PROJECT SUMMARY Stroke is the fifth most prevalent cause of death in the U.S. afflicting nearly 800,000 per year. About three quarters of strokes are first events, underscoring the importance of primary prevention. Designing optimal preventive strategies requires identification of risk factors and estimation of the risk of stroke. The most recent American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association Guidelines for the Primary Prevention of Stroke conclude that “an ideal stroke risk assessment tool that is simple, is widely applicable and accepted, and takes into account the effects of multiple risk factors does not exist.” One of the most commonly recommended predictive models is the Framingham Stroke Profile, developed and updated more than 25 years ago. Newer models have been proposed (including the Self-Reported Stroke Risk Stratification tool from the REGARDS study) but have not been thoroughly validated. Consequently, the Primary Prevention of Stroke guidelines call for more research “to validate risk assessment tools across age, sex, and race/ethnic groups” and “to evaluate whether any of the more recently identified risk factors add to the predictive accuracy of existing scales”. We propose to address these gaps by aggregating and harmonizing existing patient-level data collected as part of longitudinal cohort studies supported by the NINDS and NHLBI. The data will be obtained through a partnership with the coordinating center for the REGARDS Study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and by a request submitted to the NIH dbGap repository to obtain data from the Framingham Offspring, ARIC and MESA cohorts. At the same time, we will expand the advanced machine learning techniques developed as part of our currently funded NIH BD2K award to Duke. We will apply these models to the harmonized data to facilitate development and validation of prediction tool for primary strokes. These complex analyses will require advanced computational resources that will utilize the AHA's Precision Medicine Platform (PMP), built based on Amazon Web Services.

"Functional anomaly mapping of aphasia recovery Project Summary Difficulty communicating (aphasia) is one of the most common and debilitating results of left-hemisphere stroke. Although aphasia symptoms are highly variable and recovery is difficult to predict, much research has shown that lesion size and location are major drivers of aphasia symptoms and recovery. However, this previous research has only considered direct anatomical damage caused by the lesion. This is a critical limitation because stroke lesions also cause indirect effects on the function of brain structures distant from the lesion. Throughout this application, I refer to this as “remote dysfunction.” Although initially thought to resolve quickly after the stroke, remote dysfunction is now known to persist throughout recovery and independently contribute to outcomes. Studies of aphasia recovery have focused almost exclusively on the idea of recovery through reorganization, whereby behavioral improvement occurs through plastic reorganization of brain networks. These studies have eschewed the older idea that recovery occurs through partial resolution of remote dysfunction (RRD) caused by lesions. Consequently, it is not clear how RRD contributes to aphasia recovery. The applicant has developed a new machine learning approach called functional anomaly mapping (FAM) that uses resting BOLD functional MRI signal to map remote dysfunction throughout the brain in individual stroke survivors. FAM maps have much better test-retest reliability than current measures, like task- related fMRI activity and resting state functional connectivity, as well as several other features that make it promising as a clinically useful tool. The applicant has already demonstrated that remote dysfunction measured with FAM relates to behavioral outcomes in people with chronic aphasia. During the mentored phase of this award, the applicant will optimize the FAM approach and test competing hypotheses about the biological mechanisms generating the remote dysfunction measured in chronic aphasia. During the independent phase, the applicant proposes a longitudinal study to understand the contribution of RRD to aphasia recovery. The applicant proposes a comprehensive training plan to expand his knowledge in the following areas: the biological mechanisms of stroke recovery and neuroplasticity beyond aphasia, machine learning, biomarker development, and advanced neuroimaging analysis. The research and training during this award will enable the applicant to develop a long-term, independent research program focused on understanding the neural correlates of aphasia and developing translational brain measures to inform clinical decision-making in aphasia neurorehabilitation. Public Health Relevance Statement Difficulty communicating (aphasia) is one of the most common and debilitating results of left-hemisphere stroke. While aphasia symptoms are highly variable and recovery is difficult to predict, stroke size and location are significant determinants of outcomes. Research that leads to a more complete characterization of how stroke lesions affect residual brain function over the course of recovery will lead to a better understanding of the brain-behavior relationship in aphasia and has the potential to inform clinical decision-making in aphasia neurorehabilitation.",Functional anomaly mapping of aphasia recovery,10214766,K99DC018828,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Aphasia', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deafferentation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'aphasia recovery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral outcome', 'biomarker development', 'brain behavior', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'neuromechanism', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'stroke recovery', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIDCD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,121473
"Robotically Augmented Mental Practice for Neuromotor Facilitation SUMMARY Upper limb motor function is often impaired due to neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. The ultimate objective is to innovate effective motor rehabilitation for enhancing clinical outcomes in stroke populations by discovering and applying scientific mechanisms and developing new engineering technologies to facilitate neuromotor adaptation. In stroke rehabilitation, mental practice, such as motor imagery and action observation, is a very effective intervention when performed appropriately. The challenge is that performance quality and efficacy of mental practice are highly variable and can be compromised. It is hypothesized that control and observation of robotic grasp and release actions via synergistic proximal muscle activation will increase neuromotor excitability of the non-activated distal muscles and hand function due to cognitive engagement with the externally present and visible robotic prosthesis. The Specific Aim of this proof of concept and feasibility study is to develop and test robotically augmented mental practice with synergistic proximal muscles for neuromotor facilitation of hand muscles. A robotically augmented mental practice will be developed for individuals to grasp and release an object by controlling the associated actions of a sound- generating robotic prosthesis utilizing surface electromyography (EMG) of shoulder/trunk muscles with deep learning algorithms. To demonstrate the proof of concept of increased neuromotor excitability and hand performance in able-bodied adults, transcranial magnetic stimulation will be applied to the motor cortex for the non-activated hand muscles and reaction time and maximal voluntary contraction performances will be tested with a finger in various practice conditions. The feasibility and possible trends in stroke survivors with upper extremity disabilities will also be examined. The project will be performed at the Georgia Institute of Technology by an interdisciplinary team of experts in fields directly related to the study: an applied physiologist, mechanical and biomedical engineers, a physical therapist, and a clinical neuroscientist. The successful completion of the study will provide augmented mental practice for neuromotor facilitation for distal muscles, and evidence for efficacy will be provided in able-bodied adults and feasibility in post-stroke individuals. The results will lead to the development of a more effective priming intervention before physical practice that can facilitate functional improvement as part of stroke rehabilitation. This project will develop and test a new paradigm of motor imagery for facilitating neuromotor excitability and performance of distal muscles in the upper limb by adopting robotic prosthesis and integrating proven procedures for neuromotor facilitation. In this paradigm, individuals will interact with a robotic prosthesis by controlling the activation of the shoulder/trunk muscles that are functionally associated with the distal hand muscles. The development of this paradigm and its integration with able-bodied and post-stroke disabled individuals will open new scientific and clinical concepts and studies on augmented motor imagery, which can lead to the development of effective rehabilitation strategies for individuals with neuromotor impairment, such as hemiparetic stroke survivors.",Robotically Augmented Mental Practice for Neuromotor Facilitation,10301588,R21NS118435,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Auditory', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disabled Persons', 'Distal', 'Electromyography', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Extensor', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Fingers', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Institute', 'Robotics', 'Shoulder', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Upper Extremity', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'grasp', 'hand dysfunction', 'hemiparetic stroke', 'improved', 'innovation', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mental practice', 'motor recovery', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'physical therapist', 'post stroke', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'robot control', 'sound', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'trend', 'virtual', 'visual motor']",NINDS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2021,407538
"Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke Abstract  Lacunar strokes are small infarctions of deep penetrator end arteries that supply deep areas of brain including the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons. The “cause” of lacunar strokes has been controversial. C Miller Fisher was the first to suggest that hypertension was one cause, noting lipohyalinosis (inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall) in smaller penetrating arteries (<200um) occurred only in hypertensives. He also showed, however, that larger lacunar strokes were often associated with microatheroma associated narrowing of larger penetrating arteries. This pathology is now thought to be the most common and associated with lipid abnormalities and diabetes. Moreover, some lacunar strokes are now thought to be associated with intracranial atherosclerosis of the parent artery at the origin of the penetrators. Though lacunar strokes were not traditionally associated with large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis or cardioembolism, there are now a number of cases where lacunar strokes have been associated with large vessel atherosclerosis or cardiac causes. Indeed, in our own recent study we showed that as many as ~50% of small deep infarcts (>15mm in size) were predicted to be due to large vessel atherosclerosis or to cardioembolic disease. It is crucial to identify the correct causes of lacunar strokes because treatments differ: drugs for hypertension vs drugs for lipid abnormalities, surgery for large vessel carotid disease, anticoagulants for cardioembolic disease, and anti-platelet agents for lacunar strokes associated with hypertension or abnormal lipids or diabetes. The biology of lacunar strokes has been studied very little, and there are no accepted biomarkers for lacunar stroke or its causes. Our group, however, has begun to provide novel insights into how the immune and clotting profiles in peripheral blood differ in lacunar strokes compared to large vessel and cardioembolic strokes. We have shown that the immune response in large vessel and cardioembolic cortical strokes is mainly associated with neutrophil genes, whereas the immune response in lacunar stroke associated with hypertension /lipids/ diabetes is associated with inflammatory monocyte-related genes. However, since the preliminary studies were performed on whole blood, there is a great need to study individual immune cell types in these different causes of ischemic stroke. Therefore, in this study we will isolate neutrophils and monocytes in patients with lacunar stroke compared to large vessel and cardioembolic stroke. We will perform RNA sequencing on those cells in the following aims which allows us to measure expression levels of >250,000 alternatively spliced transcripts which are derived from the ~20,000 coding genes.  Specific Aim #1. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles in monocytes, neutrophils and whole blood differ for subcortical lacunar strokes associated with hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardioembolism compared to each other and compared to matched controls.  Specific Aim #2. Use RNAseq to demonstrate that alternatively spliced transcript level expression profiles for subcortical lacunar strokes with hypertension, lipids or diabetes are associated with monocytes, and differ from cortical large vessel and cardioembolic strokes which are associated mainly with neutrophils.  Specific Aim #3a. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to derive the minimum number of transcripts from Aim #1 that differentiate the different causes of lacunar strokes including hypertension, abnormal lipids, diabetes, large vessel atherosclerosis, or cardiac disease. Specific Aim #3b. Use the profiles derived in Aim #3a to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in a second cohort using qRT-PCR to measure expression and SVM to perform predictions with >85% sensitivity and specificity.  Significance: Identifying the causes of lacunar strokes based upon splice variant expression in individual blood cell types is important since it would affect therapy used for secondary stroke prevention. Narrative  This study will perform whole genome RNAsequencing of whole blood, neutrophils and monocytes from patients with lacunar strokes and correlate gene profiles with each cause of lacunar stroke. It will then show the lacunar stroke profiles differ from cortical strokes due to cardioembolism and large vessel atherosclerosis, and the profiles can be used to predict the cause of lacunar stroke in an independent validation cohort of patients which is important because different causes of lacunar strokes require different treatments.",Whole Genome RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of Blood from Patients with Lacunar Stroke,10168660,R01NS101718,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'BCL6 gene', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain', 'CADASIL', 'CCL2 gene', 'CCL3 gene', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cardiac', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'FPR1 gene', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Internal Capsule', 'Intracranial Atheroscleroses', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lacunar Infarctions', 'Lipids', 'MMP9 gene', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pontine structure', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'S100P gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thrombosis', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'insight', 'middle cerebral artery', 'monocyte', 'neutrophil', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'rare genetic disorder', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular risk factor', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,119834
"Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke and has no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hematoma expansion (HE), interval growth of the hematoma, is a proximate cause of worse patient outcomes and death as larger hematomas displace brain tissue; hematomas > 60 mL reliably lead to disability or death at follow-up. Preventing HE is a promising strategy to improve outcomes for patients with ICH. Our relative inability to predict HE, however, has impeded the development of effective treatment strategies for ICH, and several clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Even when HE has been reduced, our ability to detect a benefit is hampered by relatively insensitive patient outcomes. This proposal will resolve two roadblocks that prevent the development of effective treatments for ICH, the most morbid form of stroke. Three comprehensive stroke centers (two from the Northwestern Medicine system in metropolitan Chicago, IL, and the University of Texas at Houston) will partner to prospectively enroll patients with ICH, measure hemostasis, measure HE, and record patient outcomes with state of the art assessments, including the NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and NIH Toolbox. First, we will determine the mechanisms that lead to HE in acute ICH, broadly grouped into platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Each can be specifically measured and has specific treatments to improve it. For example, reduced platelet activity due to aspirin can be reliably improved with desmopressin, delayed activation of coagulation may be related to hypomagnesemia, and accelerated fibrinolysis may be reduced with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Each will be examined for predicting HE; if multiple pathways are found, we will determine which are most important with machine learning. Once the most important mechanisms of hemostasis for HE are determined, we will explore if specific therapies improve platelet activity. It is possible that specific treatments for specific deficits in hemostasis will be more likely to reduce HE than single therapies applied to ICH patients generally (e.g., Factor VII). Once hemostatic mechanisms of HE are determine, we will determine the effect of HE on patient outcomes such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a global ordinal scale), PROMIS, and NIH Toolbox. This will be crucial to plan for future clinical trials intended to improve patient outcomes through correcting abnormal hemostasis in acute ICH. Results will apply broadly to other bleeding conditions (e.g., neurotrauma). PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most morbid form of stroke. Hematoma expansion is a proximate cause of worse outcome after ICH, yet our ability to predict HE is limited. This proposal will determine how platelet activity, activation of coagulation, and fibrinolysis predict HE, and how HE, in turn, affect patient outcomes.","Hemostasis, Hematoma Expansion, and Outcomes After Intracerebral Hemorrhage",10133760,R01NS110779,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Aminocaproic Acids', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents', 'Aspirin', 'Blood Coagulation Factor VII', 'Blood Platelets', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Desmopressin', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Factor VIIa', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hypomagnesemia', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Stroke', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Texas', 'Thrombelastography', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain tissue', 'clopidogrel', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metropolitan', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'stroke trials', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,609173
